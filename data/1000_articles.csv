BBCMEP0020240309ek3900002,Syria militant group HTS forms 'reform committees' amid protests,"By BBC Monitoring

An authority linked to Syrian militant group&#160;Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) has said it has formed community committees to implement reforms amid protests against its rule.","The&#160;Salvation Government's political affairs bureau announced the measures in a statement published on 7 March via Telegram and X.

The move appeared to be an attempt to address&#160;public discontent with HTS's governance in north-western Syria, where protests against its rule have taken place since February.

The statement said that the HTS-backed authority had held meetings with local leaders, activists and journalists to listen and respond to concerns.

In response to feedback, it has set up community committees to quickly implement&#160;""genuine"" reforms and expand participatory governance.

The statement said other institutions were being developed for oversight and complaint resolution.

It stressed that the group's ""revolutionary project"" was an ongoing experiment that required collective efforts to ensure continuous improvement.

On 5 March, the HTS Shura Council issued decrees that announced that seven committees had been formed in areas such as Idlib city, Ariha, Atmeh and Jisr al-Shughur.

The decrees said the six or seven-member committees would engage with residents to address local needs and receive complaints.

They said the committees would provide assistance and facilitate communication between residents and the Salvation Government to improve services.

The announcements come amid protests in HTS-held areas that have demanded the release of detained ""revolutionaries"" and accused the group of torture in its prisons.

Protestors have also called for the resignation of HTS leader&#160;Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani.

This week, HTS&#160;said it released former senior member&#160;Abu Mariya al-Qahtani, who had been detained since last summer on espionage charges.

Al-Qahtani's release was part of a&#160;broader amnesty that also saw the release of hundreds of prisoners swept up in a crackdown on alleged spies among its ranks.

Hamas approves new ceasefire proposal","Hamas has said it accepts the latest proposal for a Gaza ceasefire.

In a brief post on Telegram yesterday, ""Hamas and the Palestinian factions announced their approval of the proposal presented to them by Egyptian and Qatari mediators.""

The Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV said that Egypt and Qatar would invite US special envoy Steve Witkoff to Cairo to finalise the agreement.

Qatari Al Jazeera TV reported that Hamas's approval ""may force Netanyahu to agree to what he previously refused"".

Al Jazeera said the terms of the new deal include the release of 10 Israeli hostages and 18 bodies, a 60-day ceasefire, Israel's withdrawal from the north and east of Gaza and entry of aid, as well as the release of all Palestinian minors and women from Israeli prisons.

We will file a briefing.

Israel examining Hamas response

Israeli media reported this morning that officials are examining Hamas's positive response to the latest ceasefire proposal.

The liberal Haaretz daily cited unnamed Israeli sources as saying that it was still unclear how Israel would respond, quoting Netanyahu as saying that Hamas was under ""atomic pressure"".

The public broadcaster Kan said that Hamas was ""trying to turn the tables and portray itself to Egypt, Qatar and the United States as the one which is willing to go the extra mile and bring and end to the war"".

Despite what Kan described as progress in talks, it also reported that Netanyahu was still expected to hold a cabinet discussion to approve plans for occupying Gaza City on 21 August.

Egypt's Sisi, Qatari PM discuss mediation

Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and visiting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani held talks yesterday in Cairo on mediation efforts for a ceasefire deal in Gaza.

""The meeting witnessed a joint emphasis on the extreme importance that Egypt and Qatar were giving to their continuing efforts, in coordination with the US, to reach a deal that would ensure an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, allow the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid without any obstacles alongside the release of hostages and captives,"" the Egyptian presidential spokesman said in a statement on Facebook.

The two officials also emphasised ""the categorical rejection of the military reoccupation of the enclave and any attempts to displace Palestinians from their land"".

Egypt and Qatar reportedly handed Hamas a new proposal to resume the Gaza ceasefire negotiations.

Israel withdrawal call splits Lebanon media

Lebanese media were divided over the US envoy Tom Barrack's call yesterday for Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory after Beirut approved a plan to disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year.

The French-language daily L'Orient-Le Jour commented that Barrack had declared himself ""satisfied"" with Lebanon's action, highlighting his comment, following talks in Beirut, that it was Israel's turn to comply with the November ceasefire agreement.

Meanwhile, the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar daily said Barrack's visit had been ""to no avail"", noting that it followed the visit of the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani, with both visits representing the ""height of tensions"" between Washington and Tehran.

The pro-Iran Al-Mayadeen TV questioned whether Barrack's comment was a ""recalculation or a new manoeuvre, while ignoring Israel's violations"" of the ceasefire agreement.

In related news, the UN Security Council started talks late yesterday on a French-drafted resolution to extend the mandate of the UN peace-keeping mission in Lebanon, Unifil, which expires on 31 August.

Israeli families cross into Syria

A group of Israeli families crossed into Syria yesterday, attempting to establish a new Jewish settlement there called ""Neve Habashan"", Israeli media reported.

According to the right-wing, pro-settlement Arutz Sheva, the families spent an ""extended period of time"" in Syria before being evacuated back to Israel by the army.

One of the members of the ""Bashan Pioneers"" movement told Arutz Sheva that the fence was ""wide open"" and it took 30-40 minutes before Israeli forces had noticed they had crossed the border area.

The Walla news site quoted the army as calling the crossing a ""serious incident that constitutes a criminal offence and endangers the public and Israeli forces"".

US forces start Iraq withdrawal

Washington has started the first phase of withdrawing forces in the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) from Iraq, as the first US convoy left the Ain al-Asad airbase in the western Anbar province yesterday, heading towards Syria.

An Iraqi military spokesman described the move as an ""indicator of Iraq's ability to confront terrorism and maintain security and stability without needing assistance from others"", according to the official news agency INA.

The first phase is scheduled to end by late September, with US troops and equipment due to be redeployed to Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region or to Kuwait.

By September 2026, the US will complete its military exit, reducing its troop numbers from around 2,000 to fewer than 500.

'Catastrophic' flooding hits southern Yemen

Yemeni media have reported that flooding from heavy rain overnight has brought parts of the southern city of Aden - the temporary capital of the internationally recognised government - to a standstill this morning.

Southern Yemen-focused Aden al-Ghad called the situation ""catastrophic"", saying floods had swept large quantities of debris on to main roads in the city's Mualla district and had submerged vehicles.

It said residents had criticised a lack of emergency response and poor drainage systems.

The leading Al-Masdar Online website said residents had been evacuated from damaged homes in the city's Crater district, and that several flights into Aden had been diverted.

Flooding across Yemen last year caused widespread devastation, with some media blaming the extent of the damage on corruption and neglect by the internationally recognised government.

Hadramawt protests - potential flashpoint?

Yemen's southeastern province of Hadramawt has become the crucible of a summer of unrest in the government-controlled south.

The Aden-based authorities have come under increasing pressure to address deteriorating economic and living conditions that have already seen months of street protests.

But weeks of protests in Hadramawt have led to fears that the province is on the brink of a military escalation that could have repercussions for the country as a whole.

The protests have also highlighted underlying tensions between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over influence in Yemen.

At a glance","- The state-owned Sudan TV dedicated most of its 19:00 GMT news bulletin on 12 March to the recapture of its headquarters by the&#160;army from the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group

- The TV&#160;said the army received&#160;much&#160;commendation in the country for &#8220;liberating&#8221; the state broadcaster headquarters

Full story

The state-owned Sudan TV channel dedicated most of its 19:00 GMT news bulletin on 12 March to the recapture of its headquarters by the regular&#160;army after weeks of fierce fighting with the rival Rapid Support Forces&#160;(RSF)&#160;paramilitary group.

The seizure of the Sudan Radio and Television Corporation&#160;(SRTC) headquarters by the army marked a significant setback for the RSF as the paramilitary group has been controlling the premises since its war with the army began in April 2023.

Sudan&#160;TV has been airing clips of army troops inside the television and radio headquarters in Omdurman, hours after the military announced the takeover.

The TV said in its 19:00 GMT bulletin on 12 March that the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) has received much commendation in the country for &#8220;liberating&#8221; the state broadcaster headquarters.

It said the armed forces, other security agents&#160;and volunteer fighters deserve recognition for the liberation of the TV headquarters in Omdurman.

&#160;""This institution serves as the national voice and embodies the people's memory and historical heritage, reflecting their culture,"" the TV said.

Sudan TV showed the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Lt Gen&#160;Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, arriving in Omdurman to congratulate the army for the victory.&#160;

The TV also broadcast a statement by the chief of staff of the Sudan army, Lt Gen Mohammed Osman al-Hussein, flaunting the liberation of the TV premises and congratulating the army for the victory.

Several ministries have&#160;issued statements &#8220;emphasising the significance of this victory as a step in the ongoing efforts to free the country from the grip of RSF rebellion&#8221;, Sudan TV said.

The television prominently broadcast statements by the governors of&#160;states controlled by the army&#160;sending congratulatory&#160;messages over the recapture of the TV premises in Omdurman.&#160;These&#160;include&#160;the Northern, Kassala, Qadaref, South Kordofan, North Kordofan, West Kordofan, Blue Nile and White Nile states.

It said the residents of some of those states who spoke to Sudan TV &#8220;expressed their joy at the liberation&#8221; of the TV premises.

Sudan TV has been operating from the eastern city of Port Sudan, which has become the government base after the conflict began.

It is worth noting that RSF has not used the state broadcaster headquarters in Omdurman for broadcasting despite having controlled it for more than ten months. It instead turned the premises into ""a military base"" according to local media.

The group has yet to comment officially on the army's recapture of the TV building.

BBCMEP0020240305ek350018h,Yemen website reports praise for newly appointed PM's walkabout in Aden,"By BBC Monitoring

Yemen's recently appointed Prime Minister Ahmed bin Mubarak has garnered praise for a walkabout in the interim capital Aden without a security detail, the southern-focused Aden al-Ghad news website reported on 5 March.","According to the report, the prime minister undertook a tour of the Seera district of Aden on the evening of 4 March. It cited separate accounts from citizens who said that he visited two neighbourhoods, where he spent time in the local markets and ate at a restaurant.

The citizens said that they had seen the prime minister ""walking around without security guards or escorts and was received with great warmth"".

The report said that the walkabout was widely praised on social media.

BBCMEP0020240319ek3j0018h,Al-Qaeda scholar condemns Algeria government for secular laws,"By BBC Monitoring

Al-Qaeda's branch in North Africa (AQIM) has released the sixth episode of a religious audio series that calls for the downfall of the Algerian state.","The jihadist group published the 19-minute message, which was packaged as a video, on 19 March via its channels on Telegram, Chirpwire and Element.

It was also posted on a website al-Ezza (alezza.net), which hosts material from both AQIM and al-Qaeda's Sahel-based affiliate.

The video opened with a correction that clarified the&#160;previous episode had been misnumbered as the sixth, when in fact it had been the fifth in the series.

The latest instalment criticised the Algerian government for their adoption of democracy in what it described as ""practical unbelief"".

It was narrated by Abu Yasir al-Jaza'iri, whose nom de guerre suggests he is Algerian, as with past segments in the long-running series that first launched in August 2022.

Despite the Algerian authorities professing to be Muslim, their acceptance of democratic principles amounted to a major deviation from Islamic teachings, al-Jaza'iri argued.

He said that enacting secular legislation, which determines what is permissible or forbidden without being grounded in Sharia law, constituted a significant breach of faith.

Democracy, by vesting legislative power in people, was tantamount to the sin of worshipping other divinities alongside God, al-Jaza'iri contended.

He cited historical and contemporary Islamic scholars such as&#160;Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, as well as the Algerian constitution to back his argument.

Jihadist groups vehemently oppose democracy, viewing it as at odds with Islamic doctrine.

The previous instalment in the series criticised the Algerian authorities for the equal treatment of Muslims and religious minorities.

BBCSAP0020240306ek3600105,"Pakistan's PTV show on PM Sharif's visit to Balochistan, political issues","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Riasat"" (the state), hosted by anchor Shahzad Raza on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 5 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Anchor Yasir Rehman hosted the show due to the absence of the regular host Shahzad Raza.","Rehman opened the show by saying that ""only a day after taking the oath of his office Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the calamity-hit people of Gwadar"". He mentioned that Gwadar and surrounding areas in South Balochistan have been badly affected by recent heavy rains. He reported that the prime minister announced ""financial support packages"" for the affected people in the area.&#160;

Rehman mentioned that earlier in his speech in the National Assembly, the prime minister had emphasised the need for ""tough measures"" and ""unpopular decisions"" to turn around the economy of Pakistan. He spoke to Khaqan Najeeb, an expert on economic affairs and asked him to comment on the prime minister's visit to Gwadar. Najeeb said the visit was a good step by the new government because Gwadar is important in connection with the CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor]. He said Gwadar was being built as a new city so it should be ensured that it has a ""world-class"" drainage and sanitation system and that in the future such problems do not occur. He also noted that Gwadar port is important for the future trade by Pakistan with regional countries including China.

Abdullah Mohmand, an analyst, said a day earlier the prime minister in his speech in the National Assembly had emphasised that he would try to address the ""issues and grievances of the people of Balochistan"" and today he visited Balochistan. He noted that by visiting the calamity-stricken people of Balochistan the prime minister ""assured the people there that the government would provide them all kind of support"". He mentioned that development works in the area would only be possible when the people there ""trust the government and the state"".&#160;

Speaking about the challenges faced by the new government Mohmand said the ""biggest challenge"" was political instability because without political stability neither the economy could be improved nor the issues of climate change could be addressed. He said: ""The economy is in turmoil at the moment"" and foreign investment would not come to Pakistan unless there is political stability and terrorist incidents do not take place. He noted that during the past year, a very large number of terrorist attacks took place in Pakistan. He also noted that climate change was a huge challenge for Pakistan.&#160; &#160;

Senior analyst P J Mir said the question is ""What kind of planning was done while building the city that it could not sustain a calamity"". He said: ""This happened because we did not plan for bad times"". He said the visit was needed for ""appeasement"" but the prime minister should not be taking every burden. He said the prime minister should delegate the authority to the chief minister. He appreciated that the disaster-stricken people were being provided ""relief"".&#160;

Javed Siddique, a senior journalist and analyst, was of the view that the prime minister's decision to visit Gwadar should be appreciated because it is a place of ""strategic importance"" and ""the future of our trade is linked with it"". He expressed the view that Balochistan needed a ""healing touch"" as the Baloch nationalist parties keep complaining that Balochistan has been ignored and some ""anti-Pakistan foreign forces also exploit such issues"" which has created ""issues of militancy and insurgency"" in the area. He said in this context the Prime Minister took a timely step by giving priority to Balochistan. He emphasised that the federal and provincial governments should show that ""Balochistan is their primary concern"".

Rehman questioned whether Asif Ali Zardari, the co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party [PPP], who is the presidential candidate of the parties in the government was in a ""comfortable position"" for his election on 9 March. Mohmand said the PPP has contacted various parties and was in a strong position in Sindh while having sufficient support in the Punjab and Balochistan assemblies and the National Assembly.

Mir said Zardari was in a comfortable position as he had the numbers. He appreciated that PPP and PML-N which were ""arch-rivals"" have joined together ""for the sake of the country"".

Siddique said Zardari would be elected the president comfortably and recalled that in the past when Zardari was the president of the country he conducted his office ""very smoothly"". He was of the view that Zardari, as president, would try to play a role in bringing the opposition and the PML-N government closer.

At least 10 people were seriously injured on 24 March in Senegal's central town of Mbacke as they celebrated opposition candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye&#8217;s impressive show in the presidential vote, privately owned news website Dakaractu has reported.&#160;","Faye took an early lead against his main rival Amadou Ba as counting started late on 24 March.

""Thousands of young people flooded the city centre shouting victory. An overflowing joy that also claimed a few victims,"" Dakaractu said.&#160;

""In the euphoria, about 10 young people were run over by vehicles or fell off their motorcycles. They were all taken to Matlabul Fawzeini hospital and treated by Pastef.""

Faye was the preferred candidate of the officially disbanded Patriots of Senegal (Pastef) party of Ousmane Sonko, who was barred from taking part in the elections.&#160;

Ba, the ruling coalition's candidate, has said celebrations were premature and predicted the vote could go to a run-off.

Official results are expected to be released by 29 March at the latest.

Iranian pop singer Amir-Hossein Maqsoudlou, better known as Amir Tataloo, has gone on trial before a court in Tehran, the judiciary's Mizan News Agency reported on 4 March.&#160;","The initial court session was presided over by Judge Iman Afshari, a hardline cleric who is notorious for issuing execution orders against political prisoners.

BBCSUP0020240325ek3p000jh,"Russian weekly TV highlights: Putin, TV point finger at Ukraine over Crocus raid","Main themes on Russian TV weekly news review programmes on Rossiya 1, Channel One and NTV on 24 March

In unison, as if on instructions from above, the weekly news review shows on Russia&#8217;s three main TV channels on 24 March pointed a finger at Ukraine over the Crocus City Hall attack.","By association, it was further suggested that broader forces wished Russia ill and would stop at nothing to that end.&#160;

Was it Ukraine?

&#8220;All the shooters in the barbaric terrorist attack in the Moscow region have been detained. They were heading for Ukraine,&#8221; as per the night&#8217;s main headline on Rossiya 1&#8217;s Vesti Nedeli (News of the Week), with Dmitry Kiselyov (which was again brought forward by an hour to start at 1900 Moscow time (1600 gmt) rather than its usual 2000).

The suggestion that Ukraine was involved was repeated and amplified across the board, on each of the three main channels. On Rossiya 1, its Vesti Nedeli began with Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s speech, in which he linked the attack with Ukraine. All four perpetrators have been found and detained, but &#8220;tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them from the Ukrainian side to cross the state border&#8221;, Putin said.

&#8220;Just like the Nazis who once carried out massacres in the occupied territories, they planned to stage a show execution, a bloody act of intimidation,&#8221; he went on, but whoever directed them will be punished.

&#8220;Both the US and Europe understand that any connection between Ukraine and the attack on Crocus City Hall would be suicide for both Kyiv and the entire anti-Russian alliance; in which case, Moscow will conduct possible negotiations on completely different terms,&#8221; one of Rossiya 1&#8217;s reports remarked.

Several narratives were employed on Russian TV on the night to amplify the suggestion that Ukraine was involved, if not directly to blame it. The gamut ranged from the expression of doubt that the Islamic State group (IS/ISIS) was behind it in any of its iterations, to the propaganda refrain which frames Ukraine as a terrorist state.

Escalation?&#160;

This, for instance, was Kiselyov: &#8220;They are already trying to throw everyone off the scent and, for example, they are talking about ISIS, while denials are coming from Kyiv, saying that it was not us. However, the irrefutable fact remains that the terrorists sought salvation in Ukraine and after their crime they headed in that direction, stopped just 100 kilometres from the border. Moreover, ISIS has a different style - terrorist attacks in the name of ISIS are carried out by suicide bombers who do not then try to escape.&#8221; &#8220;Islamic shaheds [martyrs or suicide bombers] usually commit suicide. These shooters, however, rushed to where they were presumably being expected - to Ukraine. Having failed to achieve success on the battlefield, Kyiv is increasingly turning into a terrorist country as it destroys civilians and shells cities day after day,&#8221; one of the reports on Rossiya 1 intoned.

These particular subthemes were elaborated elsewhere, including extensive editorial commentary by host Irada Zeynalova of NTV&#8217;s Itogi Nedeli (Results of the Week), to take just one of the many examples.

Here, Zeynalova, too, raised doubts about IS&#8217;s involvement. She proceeded to claim that Russia was the target of presumably far broader forces whose aim it is &#8220;to hurt us&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;and to this end they are ready to do anything&#8221;. Furthermore, she appeared to suggest that this amounted to an escalation &#8211; or, she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s simply that they now want to raise the level of tension at any price&#8221;.

&#8220;The absolutely clear understanding is that the Crocus attack could be a continuation of a chain of events in which sanctions have failed to cause us to collapse, the billions spent on weapons have been to no avail, and neither have been the propaganda campaign, the pledges of unwavering support for Kyiv or the plans for a counteroffensive, so terrorism is what is left in the arsenal,&#8221; Zeynalova posited.

This, she said, will not work either, but know, she said, that two can play this game.

Coordination?

In large measure, this was echoed on Channel One&#8217;s Voskresnoye Vremya (Sunday Time). Here, inter alia and in concert with the other two networks, it gleaned what it more or less suggested was an international conspiracy, including by media in the West, to blame IS and thus divert suspicion away from Ukraine.

As it, like the other two, chided &#8220;the position taken by the media in the West, as it promotes the version of events which holds that Ukraine and terror are two different things&#8221;, it referred to the Foreign Ministry. &#8220;Any exoneration of Kyiv by Washington before the Crocus investigation is completed should be regarded as evidence&#8221; &#8211; that is to say, with suspicion, according to the ministry.

Uniquely, even US Fox News TV and its &#8220;eternal antagonist&#8221; CNN were in agreement about the role of Islamic State in the Crocus attack, in what Channel One suggested was a coordinated fashion. Other international media were name-checked in this context, including &#8220;information planted&#8221; by Reuters with a reference to the claim of responsibility on &#8220;Islamists&#8217; Telegram channel hitherto known to no-one&#8221;. It went on to raise similar doubts in other ways. &#8220;In the process, with incredible zeal, the US media sought to exonerate the Kyiv regime. Even though no-one had yet brought forward any accusations against the government of Ukraine, they began to make excuses in advance, one can say proactively, as if they knew something.&#8221; &#8220;All these efforts to divert attention turned out to be so coordinated that all they did was to attract it even more,&#8221; according to Channel One.

In various ways all three channels suggested there was equivalence between the Crocus attack and what they presented as Ukraine&#8217;s terror tactics &#8211; Russian propaganda&#8217;s term for cross-border attacks by Ukraine. All of them, the reports claimed, invariably target civilians, such as the shelling of Russia&#8217;s border Belgorod region. Furthermore, some of the discourse suggested a link between Ukraine and Islamic State &#8211; such as a claim contained in the Channel One report that &#8220;several dozen ISIS militants&#8221; had been deployed secretly by the US to fight on the side of the &#8220;regime&#8221;.

Putin&#8217;s comments were televised accordingly. &#8220;In the past, the West actively took advantage of various kinds of cross-border radical terrorist groups, including as it encouraged their aggression against Russia. It is natural that the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime - again with the support of the West, and often on direct orders &#8211; has switched to terrorist methods. This means the shelling of peaceful cities, assassination attempts against government officials and public figures, or attempts to recruit perpetrators of sabotage and terrorist attacks at Russia&#8217;s critical infrastructure facilities and in places where people are in large numbers,&#8221; Putin told the FSB security service&#8217;s top brass.

Putin v traitors

As usual, Putin&#8217;s comments served as the cue for much of the content on the night. A contrast was notably drawn between a nation united in grief and strong in the face of this attempt to intimidate it, on the one hand, and the &#8220;traitors&#8221; to the nation on the other.

On Rossiya 1, those against whom Putin railed as &#8220;traitors&#8221; were denounced in a dedicated piece of commentary from Kiselyov, who took his lead from what Putin had said earlier. Russia has no capital punishment, Putin said, but all those who have taken up arms to fight against their Mother Russia would be treated as enemy combatants. Each of them will be hunted down, Putin added, without statute of limitation. &#8220;We remember what the Vlasovites did on Soviet soil, and for this we will never forgive them.&#8221;

His reference to the Red Army&#8217;s defector Gen Andrei Vlasov provided the backdrop to commentary in which the word &#8220;traitors&#8221; and its apparent synonym &#8220;Vlasovites&#8221; was applied to others. They in particular included those Kiselyov branded &#8220;the new Vlasovites&#8221; &#8211; gathered together for an anti-Putin forum in Kyiv and headed by exiled anti-Kremlin figure Ilya Ponomaryov, the subject of particular opprobrium.

A long list of the Chechen separatist leaders and field commanders assassinated or otherwise neutralised followed from Kiselyov, linked by him to Putin&#8217;s a ""historic"" threat against ""terrorists"" in 1999 (&#8220;we shall wipe them out in the outhouse"", although one of those on Kiselyov's list was Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, assassinated in 1996).

Implicitly, the threat could thus be taken to extend to others, like Ponomarev, not to mention the Russian Legion or the Russian Volunteer Corps, both reportedly actively involved in fighting on Ukraine&#8217;s side. ""Russia and Putin do not forgive such things,"" Kiselyov said. &#8220;The Russian scumbag traitors thrown into meat assaults against their own motherland by the Bandera Nazi regime have two options: either perish now or a little later, but the end is predetermined in any case,&#8221; Kiselyov said.

Dissonant with this discourse, the same programme, Vesti Nedeli, asserted the putative involvement of &#8220;new Vlasovites&#8221; in the cross-border raids into Russia from Ukraine was no more than a &#8220;smokescreen&#8221;. &#8220;The Kyiv regime tried to present these attacks as an operation by traitors, as in that our positions were attacked by defectors, new Vlasovites. In fact, this was an operation by the Kyiv regime&#8217;s Main Intelligence Directorate [HUR], in which HUR&#8217;s Spetsnaz [special-forces] groups were involved along with foreign mercenaries. The Vlasovites were just a smokescreen, a billboard,&#8221; it said.

Other: Ukraine, Europe, US

As before, reports continued to refer euphemistically to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine as a &#8220;special military operation&#8221;. As usual, they claimed a catastrophic situation on the front line and a critical situation behind the lines in Ukraine.

&#8220;Front-line&#8221; dispatches claimed that Russian forces continued to advance towards Chasiv Yar, outside Bakhmut, as they have claimed for the past few weeks (though a distance of 10 miles between the two population centres). Each of the three channels aired reports that framed Russia&#8217;s latest series of massed attacks against Ukraine&#8217;s energy infrastructure in particular as &#8220;retribution&#8221; strikes for attacks against targets inside Russia.

In US-related reports, both Rossiya 1 and NTV sought to lend credence to allegations that Donald Trump&#8217;s life was in danger as the threat of they described as his &#8220;physical liquidation&#8221; loomed large.

NTV alone sought to promote another conspiracy theory &#8211; a &#8220;new war&#8221; apparently in the making. &#8220;Statements that China will attack Taiwan in 2027 are precisely about this, and for the sake of this new war they will wear us down so that China does not have an ally,&#8221; Zeynalova claimed. Further discourse about the sinister US followed, including about the role of its miliary-industrial complex, where &#8220;big money&#8221; mingles accordingly with big politics.&#160;

Similarly, Rossiya 1 raised the spectre of US &#8220;hegemony&#8221; through military trade. &#8220;Increased defence spending will force nations to mercilessly cut social spending. This is something that none of the current European governments is likely to survive. The plan is totally outrageous, but they have no other choice. In fact, this is not even their plan, but that of the US. Washington is simply putting it into practice through the European elite it controls, which by its nature has the only aim - to ensure American hegemony in this part of the world,&#8221; Rossiya 1&#8217;s Europe correspondent Mikhail Antonov said, true to form.&#160;

His and other reports continued to claim a lack of unity on support for Ukraine both in Europe and the US.

Over the studio caption ""Gallic fighting cock"", Kiselyov of Vesti Nedeli continued to attack French President Emanuel Macron &#8211; &#8220;bellicose&#8221; towards Russia but ""increasingly ridiculous"", unpopular and mocked even in France. Cue video/audio of a cockerel in a protracted cry of cock-a-doodle-do.

On all three channels, meanwhile, long reports marked the 25th anniversary of Nato&#8217;s bombing of Yugoslavia &#8211; decried by Kiselyov (despite Russia&#8217;s own track record of atrocities in Ukraine) as &#8220;a barbarity that lasted 78 days, with 1,700 civilians killed and more than 10,000 wounded&#8221;.&#160;

At least 10 people were killed in a suspected mortar explosion in Nyanzale town, Bwito chiefdom, Rutshuru territory, eastern DR Congo, privately-owned Virunga Business Radio FM reported on 4 March.","The town and surrounding villages were reportedly shelled by rebels from the March 23 Movement (M23), who launched several attacks on government-held territory on 4 March.

""According to local civil society, the victims were residents who had fled the town after fighting broke out between the DR Congo army (FARDC) and M23 rebels. Our source also says that a [mortar] shell fell on the farmers, injuring several people, including women and children. As the fighting continues, local sources claim that the M23-RDF [Rwandan Defence Force] coalition has taken control of Kihondo, a village a few kilometres from the town of Nyanzale,"" the radio said.

According to the report, the rebels looted captured villages, but have so far failed to take Nyanzale, which is held by pro-government Wazalendo fighters.

According to local groups quoted in media reports, the renewed fighting follows the arrival of reinforcements and supplies that have boosted the M23's capacity to fight FARDC troops in the region.

At a glance","- Russian state TV's current affairs talk shows on 13 March provided extensive coverage of an interview with President Vladimir Putin that was broadcast earlier in the day

- Reports in the Western media casting remarks by Putin on Russia's nuclear arsenal as a threat and linking it to the previous day's reported cross-border incursion from Ukraine were dismissed as over-the-top and mendacious

- But one of the programmes itself linked his comment to the incursion

Full story

Russian TV talk shows on 13 March devoted much of their airtime to discussing an interview given by President Vladimir Putin to state TV host Dmitry Kiselyov.

But the two main programmes, state Rossiya 1's 60 Minutes and government-controlled Channel One's Vremya Pokazhet, took very different approaches.

On Vremya Pokazhet, the focus was very much on ridiculing as distorted Western media coverage that was said to have interpreted Putin's remark that Russia is militarily to use its nuclear weapons as a threat.

""People in the West like to scare themselves, maintain themselves through lies, and because of that, they are using lies and manipulating with all their might,"" said presenter Olesya Loseva at the top of the show.

She added that Putin's remarks were being ""torn out of context"", adding: ""I don't know, maybe it makes them happy.""

Responding, studio guest Frants Klintsevich stressed that Russia ""will never be the first to use nuclear weapons, and what's most important, there are no preconditions for this right now"".

He then explained that the point was that Russia's armed forces, and specifically its nuclear deterrent, were no longer in the parlous state they once were in the 1990s.

""The narrative has been let loose that seeks to prove our political inability to act to settle any issues, to prove our unpleasant aggressive Russian character, some kind of intentions on our part,"" he said, adding: ""The main thing is not to harm oneself, one's own people. People know this.""

He then turned to the camera, as if to address the viewers, and said: ""So, don't worry, people, everything will be fine.""

The programme was especially at pains to reject what were said to be Western media interpretations linking Putin's remarks on nuclear weapons to the previous day's claimed armed incursion from Ukraine.

Pointing to a headline on the Independent's live page - now amended to read differently - that said that ""Putin is prepared for nuclear war as pro-Kyiv militias launch cross-border incursion"", co-host Ruslan Ostashko said:"" I never stop being surprised at so-called Western journalism.""

""Where did they hear this in the interview? Nothing close to that was said,"" he said.

However, over on Rossiya 1, the same approach as the Independent was arguably taken by 60 Minut's presenter, Olga Skabeyeva, in linking the two developments.

""Putin for the first time commented on the attack by Ukrainian terrorists on Belgorod and Kursk regions, and said that Russia is ready for nuclear war, in an extreme case, of course, but the nuclear triad is ready,"" she said at the top of her programme.

Unlike 60 Minut, which did not make prominent mention of the previous day's reported incursion, 60 Minut devoted a fair chunk at the top of the programme to the official Defence Ministry line that it been stopped at the border with great losses to the attackers.

""The incursion of Ukrainian terrorists into Russian territory was a complete failure, and Russian intelligence knew about the plan to attack from three directions at once,"" Skabeveya said in an unattributed comment stated as fact.

The programme went on to show lengthy excerpts from Putin's speech throughout.

Putin's remarks saying that Russia was ready for negotiations on Ukraine in principle, but only on the basis of ""facts that have emerged on the ground"" rather than ""wishful desires after the use of psychotropic substances"" was especially highlighted.

The latter comment was interpreted by Skabeyeva as meaning that Putin had, in her words, ""again and unambiguously hinted that [President Volodymyr] Zelensky really is a drug addict"".

60 Minutes did find time to mock Western media reaction to Putin's comments as hysterical, albeit far less prominently than Vremya Pokazhet.

Putin's comments that Russia was ready to consider responding in kind if the US resumes nuclear testing had made the ""Western propaganda machine literally blow up into pieces"", according to Skabeyeva.

Later, she spoke of ""Western lead articles about Putin having issued terrifying warnings"", commenting: ""Once again, we have been misunderstood.""

Khamenei&#160;said that in light of the Gaza conflict, both Western powers and regional states have become aware of ""the true capacities of the resistance front"".&#160;

""The US sought to take control of whole region's issues"" to no avail, he said, adding that the ""resistance groups"" have ""disrupted all of America's calculations"" and that the US has no choice but to leave the region.

Khamenei said Israel ""faces not only difficulties in defending itself but also struggles to extricate itself from the crisis"", and is ""trapped in a Gaza quagmire"", leading to defeat whether it stays or leaves.

An Ethiopian shipping company has said that it's&#160;struggling with disrupted cargo shipments amid the&#160;Red Sea security crisis, privately-owned Addis Standard website reported on 28 March.&#160;","The Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Service Enterprise said that the impediments it faced in its cargo operations due to the ongoing security crisis in the Red Sea was significantly impacting the country's import and export activities.

&#8220;In an official statement, the state-owned enterprise highlighted that major shipping companies have curtailed their visits to the region, with some ceasing operations altogether due to the precarious conditions prevailing in the Red Sea. This development has resulted in logistical challenges concerning both the time and expenses involved in shipments to and from Ethiopia,&#8221; the report said.

The company elaborated that numerous cargo vessels - previously integral to its operations through collaborative arrangements - had refrained from docking at the Djibouti port owing to the heightened risks in the Red Sea vicinity.

Consequently, the shipping company has escalated the utilisation of its own fleet to transport goods from the ports of origin for inbound shipments, ensuring the continuity of the import supply chain.&#160;

Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin to discuss Moscow's socioeconomic development, including the development of transport infrastructure, improvement of production performance and investment activity.","President of Russia Vladimir Putin: How are the things, Mr Sobyanin?

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin: I must say, Mr President, despite our enemies' scheming and sanctions...

Vladimir Putin: We have more friends than we have enemies.

Sergei Sobyanin: I do not know about others, but for us, everything is going quite well.

Vladimir Putin: There is a famous saying, ""It is equally honourable to be Russia's friend or enemy.""

Sergei Sobyanin: Bless their hearts.

I think that Moscow's 2023 performance results are among the best in recent history. We are witnessing significant growth across the key production indicators such as pharmaceuticals, car manufacturing, and microelectronics, with growth ranging from 25% to 40%. Investment in property, both commercial and residential, as well as housing construction, are on a continuous upward trajectory. Our renovation programme is also ongoing.

The projects we have launched with you, such as Moscow Metro's Big Circle Line and the High-Speed Diameter, are operating efficiently. Currently, the Big Circle Line transports 1.3 million people daily, while the high-speed diameter accommodates 400,000 cars daily. In terms of economic impact, over a trillion roubles has been added to the federal budget and extra-budgetary funds with the start of the Big Circle Line, providing significant budgetary benefits.

Vladimir Putin: Since it started operating?

Sergei Sobyanin: No, since the construction started: while construction is in progress, the budget already benefits from VAT and taxes. The phased introduction of the Big Circle Line over several years has resulted in direct advantages.

The city budget is developing successfully, with investments showing varying trends in different years (shows a presentation). However, considering longer periods, such as from 2009 to 2011, our investment volume has surged from two trillion to 17 trillion, a 3.7-fold increase even in comparable prices. This includes investments in housing, buildings, machinery, purchased equipment, and intellectual property. The city demonstrates remarkable growth dynamics, thanks to your support, the Government, and, of course, the residents of Moscow, who are working actively and stay optimistic.

Vladimir Putin: We understand that the threats we are facing are not empty and we need to keep that in mind at all levels, the Government, federal and regional. Moscow is not just a region, it is the capital and the country's scientific, educational, and industrial centre. Therefore, it is all connected with the economy of the entire country. And we need to constantly keep that in mind. Let us discuss all this in more detail.

Sergei Sobyanin: Absolutely, Mr President.

NYTFEED020240331ek3v001e1,Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead Go From ‘Fargo’ to ‘Moscow’,"The first time that Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead shot a scene together, they were in a bathtub, mostly naked. McGregor, in a maximally unflattering wig, was sticking his gut out as far as it would go.

“You were just trying to be as grotesque as you could be,” Winstead said affectionately.","This was on a recent afternoon in the chilly basement of a midtown hotel where McGregor and Winstead perched on a love seat, his jacket over his shoulders, his hand on her knee. They met in 2017, on the set of the third season of “Fargo,” co-starring as Ray Stussy, a hapless parole officer, and Nikki Swango, his grifter sweetheart. (McGregor also played Emmit Stussy, Ray’s twin.) Two years later, in 2019, they filmed “Birds of Prey” but did not share scenes. They are also both participants in the “Star Wars” franchise — McGregor in the ’90s and ’00s films and the more recent “Obi-Wan Kenobi” series, Winstead in “Ahsoka” — though again they did not share scenes. In 2021, Winstead gave birth to their son. The next year, they married.

Now, they have reunited onscreen for “A Gentleman in Moscow,” which premiered Friday on Paramount+ and debuts Sunday on Showtime. An adaptation of Amor Towles’s novel, it stars McGregor as Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, a mustached aristocrat sentenced to house arrest in a luxury hotel in the years following the Russian Revolution. Winstead appears as Anna Urbanova, an actress and the count’s sometimes girlfriend. Somehow, in the confines of the hotel, they make a life.

In an hourlong conversation, in a hotel somewhat more modest than Moscow’s Metropol, they discussed claustrophobia, facial hair and the benefits and detriments of working with a spouse. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

How did you get involved with “A Gentleman in Moscow”?

EWAN MCGREGOR It came to me first. I loved the grand nature of the drama, the love and loss and romance. I feel like it’s rarer and rarer to get a chance to play that stuff. At the heart of it, it’s about a man who’s learning to be a husband and learning to be a dad and crawling out of his ideas of the aristocratic way of life to find who he really is.

MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD You had hinted, cheekily, that there was a great female character in there. Reading the book, I just thought, ‘Oh my God, what a great, juicy opportunity that would be to play her.’ But I was very tentative because the last thing I wanted was to try to win a role and then have somebody think I was trying to get something out of being married to you. I just wanted to quietly say, “I think it’s a great role if you think I’m right for it.”

Did you ever worry that it would feel claustrophobic, shooting in these few hotel rooms?

MCGREGOR It had to feel like that. It should feel like that. It focuses a magnifying glass on these characters.

WINSTEAD That’s one of the great things about confined spaces. As an actor, it’s exciting because there’s nowhere to go but into the words. It’s great to know that’s going to be the focus, rather than pyrotechnics.

Did you grow your own mustache?

MCGREGOR I had to. I couldn’t have a stuck-on mustache. I’ve had them in the past and they’re terrible to wear. You come in in the morning, you’ve had to shave and then you put glue on that shaved skin, which is [expletive] horrible. Then you stick it on and it stops you from moving your face. The last thing you want to be thinking about when you’re acting is not moving. So I grew my own.

During the strike, I didn’t know when we’d be going back, so I just grew a beard around it. Because you don’t want a mustache in your real life. I mean, you do if you like mustaches, but I don’t.

Tell me about Alexander.

MCGREGOR He’s an aristocrat. He enjoyed the high life of his class at that time. Then it’s taken away during the revolution. He’s allowed to live, but the rest of his class is destroyed. So he’s somewhat lost.

And what about Anna? Is she a good actress?

WINSTEAD Anna believes that she is. I do think she takes it very seriously. It’s something positive in her life that gives her a sense of purpose. She does hang in there, even if she’s not always a star. That has to count for something.

They have a superb meet-cute, when the count tames Anna’s Russian wolfhounds. What’s their initial attraction?

WINSTEAD I instantly find him very intriguing. The way that he handles my dogs, it sparks a little something. Our repartee makes me further intrigued. Then hearing about him and knowing that he’s imprisoned in this hotel, the mystery is interesting to me as a woman who gets bored very easily by most men that I’m around. Over time, that leads to much, much more.

It’s so lovely how much time it takes. It’s many years into their relationship before they realize they’re in love. There’s something beautiful about that slow progression. Especially for Anna. She resists that feeling. But it hits her like a wave.

I understand that you didn’t know each other before “Fargo.” But Mary, is it true that you had a crush on him as a teenager?

WINSTEAD The thing is, if you were a teenager when “Trainspotting” and “Moulin Rouge” came out, I don’t think you could not have an awareness. But I didn’t have any posters on my wall. I wasn’t writing his name in my notebook.

Good, that would be creepy. What was it like working together on “Fargo”?

WINSTEAD We loved it.

MCGREGOR We did. It was amazing writing. I feel like there were two shows because I played the two characters. But our story line was amazing. To play Ray and Nikki, what a great pair, what a great partnership, what a great oddball couple.

WINSTEAD I remember meeting with Noah [Hawley, the showrunner] and my only question was, “Does she really love him?” And he was like, “Yes.” And that made it so much more interesting, to play a grifter with a heart, as cheesy as that sounds. So much more fun to have something real at the center of it.

Mary, earlier you alluded to a downside of working together, in that people might think you were offered a role for reasons other than your talent.

WINSTEAD Of course, there’s always going to be one person on the internet who makes that comment, but I’m secure enough to not worry about that because I know the truth, which is that people want to work with me. When we were first together, I was up for a role in something that he was in. They were worried we would bring some sort of drama to the set, which we thought was very funny because we’re not very dramatic people. But you have to let time deal with that. Now it’s clear that we’re a pretty levelheaded couple, that we’re not going around smashing vases. Other than that, it’s really been just upsides, which is that people who know us and like our work are happy and excited to put us together occasionally, which is a really lucky thing for us.

MCGREGOR There’s no downside in terms of actually doing it. It’s only great to go to work together, get to work together, come home together. It’s as good as it could be, really.

What was it like working together this time?

MCGREGOR It made it so much more fun to play all the cold-shoulder stuff at the beginning of the story. After they’ve spent the night together, she won’t speak to him or look at him.

WINSTEAD Then the later stuff, when things get deep, it was very emotional. I can’t talk about it without crying. It was just all there, which is an amazing thing. It’s just like, Oh, I’m here in front of my partner. So I’ll just let all those feelings wash over.

Did you like him with that mustache?

WINSTEAD You know, I did. I did for a long time. But I did start to miss his face underneath it.

Will you work together again?

WINSTEAD I don’t know.

MCGREGOR (simultaneously) Yes!

WINSTEAD We hope so. It’s just about finding the right beautiful thing."

Continued cautious stance on re-engaging with Syria

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi yesterday stated Tehran is ""not in a rush"" to restore diplomatic ties with Syria, severed after the fall of its ally President Bashar al-Assad.

Araqchi in an interview cited Syria's internal instability, risk of fragmentation, and economic challenges as reasons for this approach. He said Iran has received no official signals from Damascus on resuming relations.

The remarks follow an alleged diplomatic incident involving Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Syrian authorities reportedly refused to allow Larijani's aircraft to enter Syrian airspace en route to Lebanon from Iraq on 13 August, forcing it to fly a longer route via Turkey to reach Beirut.

Araqchi declined to confirm details of that event but acknowledged the presence of potential intermediaries and said Iran prefers to wait for suitable conditions before any re-engagement.

Iran weighs limited IAEA engagement amid snapback tensions

Araqchi in the same interview indicated Tehran may send a delegation to Vienna for talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stating a complete halt to cooperation is ""not feasible.""

Araqchi cited the imminent need for IAEA inspectors to oversee a fuel replacement at the Bushehr nuclear power plant as a practical reason for maintaining limited engagement. However, he stressed that any return of inspectors would require approval from Iran's Supreme National Security Council, in line with a parliamentary law mandating a suspension of cooperation until Iran's enrichment rights are recognised.

Araqchi dismissed the legal authority of the E3 (UK, France, Germany) to trigger a snapback of pre-2015 UN sanctions but conceded it remains a possibility. He revealed that Iran has developed a coordinated response plan with Russia and China should the mechanism be activated.

Regarding the US, Araqchi ruled out an imminent resumption of talks, stating the necessary ""negotiation maturity"" is absent.

He said that demanding compensation for recent US bombing damage was not a direct precondition but insisted the issue must be addressed within any future negotiation framework.

The statement further noted that Tabrizi did not return to prison in the two months and 10 days after that and before her death. It added that a suspended sentence had been issued against her.

It explained that, in this context, a suspended sentence meant that if she committed no crimes within two years of the issuing of the ruling, the sentence would have been revoked.

It added that the RTS was ordered not to broadcast Faye&#8217;s videos, but his campaign officials vowed to &#8220;refer the matter to the national electoral commission to overturn the decision of the regulatory body&#8221;.

Faye is the official candidate of the disbanded Pastef party of jailed opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, who was declared ineligible to stand for the presidency due to a criminal conviction.&#160;

Presidential campaigns have been allocated equal time on state TV following the formal kick-off of a two-week electoral campaign period on 10 March.&#160;

BBCMNF0020240325ek3p0035x,Pro-ISKP group threatens Russia with revenge for 'imprisoned brothers',"By BBC Monitoring

A poster by a prominent media group supportive of Islamic State&#8217;s Khorasan Province branch (ISKP) has threatened Russia with retaliation over the ""imprisonment"" and ""torture"" of ""brothers"".&#160;","This appeared to be a reference to Russian authorities' arrest and apparent torture of individuals suspected of carrying out the 22 March attack at a concert hall near Moscow, for which IS has claimed responsibility.

While the poster, released on 25 March, did not specify who it meant by the ""imprisoned brothers"", its reference to the attack of ""Friday"" and ""the broadcasting of videos of prisoners being tortured"", suggest it was referring to the suspects detained in the latest Moscow attack.&#160;

The poster was issued by the pro-ISKP al-Azaim media group and has so far appeared in Pashto, Tajik, Persian and in somewhat clumsy English. It was circulated on 25 March via pro-ISKP Telegram channels.&#160;

The text warned &#8220;all brutal Russians, including Putin&#8221; that they will experience further ""massacres"", and that the imprisonment of ""brothers"" has sharpened the resolve of their fellow IS loyalists to strike again.

It cited the ""Friday"" attack to indicate that IS militants are capable of delivering heavy blows, and can do it again.&#160;

The poster featured a picture of a knife-wielding militant, and was entitled: ""Threat - to all brutal Russians, including Putin!""

It concluded by saying that &#8220;very soon&#8221; &#8220;you will be massacred all together with your women and children&#8221;.

IS itself has not clarified the fate of the four attackers, after it initially said on 22 March that they had managed to ""safely"" flee the site of the attack. This was before Russian authorities announced the detention of the assailants.

The jihadist group is generally reticent in its official language regarding attacks where suspects have been detained, likely to avoid incriminating its own members.

This appears to be the first al-Azaim product referencing the IS-claimed Russia attack, although pro-ISKP Telegram channels have been full of messaging celebrating and highlighting the attack.

The insurgency in the northern Cabo Delgado Province has already displaced 1.4 million people in Mozambique, Mozambican news agency AIM reported on 21 March.","The numbers were announced by the justice ministry at a conference in the capital, Maputo.

Although the number of deaths caused by the conflict was not officially confirmed, sources from the government point to over 4,000 victims, the report said.

Speaking at the event, the permanent secretary in&#160;the ministry of justice, Justino Tonela, said that the humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado remains ""challenging"", seven years after the start of the conflict.

""We are seeing a resurgence of the terrorist threat in the province which affects the population's access to basic services and goods,"" Tonela was quoted as saying.

Tonela also pointed that while the province has seen an increase in militant attacks since the start of the year, a large number of displaced people have chosen to return to their areas of origin, contributing to the resumption of commercial activities across several districts.

A pro-al-Qaeda online media outlet has incited Muslims to attack Jews and Christians worldwide in response to the Gaza war, and specifically urged gun attacks in New York.","The outlet added that the impending Muslim holy month of Ramadan is an auspicious time for such attacks.

Al-Malahim Cyber Army (MCA) issued the incitement in a two-page Arabic statement released via its dedicated Telegram bot on 5 March.

The MCA (aka Al-Malahem Electronic Army, Jaysh al-Malahim al-Electroni), typically focuses on inciting ""lone wolf"" attacks in the West.

The MCA's 5 March statement said that Muslims have a duty towards Gazans in the face of a ""campaign of annihilation"". Moreover, it said, protecting al-Aqsa Mosque is the responsibility of ""all of us"".

Therefore, it asserted that ensuring the victory of the ""mujahidin"" in Gaza is an individual obligation (""fard ain"" in Arabic) on every Muslim.

The MCA claimed that ""we"" fight on several fronts against a single enemy, which is an alliance of Jews and Christians in a war on Islam in its entirety, not just in Gaza. It is an open war and the whole world is its arena, in its words.

The statement declared that in this light, ""we"" must believe that anyone who unleashes gunfire in God's name on the streets of New York is helping those firing rockets from Gaza.

This rhetoric of Gaza being part of a global religious war between Muslims and their enemies is reminiscent of al-Qaeda's rival Islamic State group's messaging on the conflict. (See here)

In a reference to Ramadan, which this year starts on around 10 March, the MCA noted that the ""month of conquests"" is imminent, so it urged Muslims firm up their resolve and launch raids.

It warned that people are either on the side of the ""Jewish-Christian coalition"" or with Islam, with there being no middle ground.

The statement also urged readers not to believe the West's claim to be neutral on the Gaza conflict and to be upset by what is happening in ""Palestine"". On this score, it mocked the US for dropping a few food parcels in Gaza, whilst allegedly backing Israel's war.

This is because the initial claim on 22 March came through the group's news outlet Amaq, which does not habitually give information about the affiliated branch responsible.

Five principles to end war

Yesterday President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders agreed on five principles to end the war in Ukraine, the Suspilne public broadcaster reported on its website. It noted that the decision was taken on the eve of the 15 August Trump-Putin talks in Alaska.

The principles are as follows:

1. Anything concerning Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine.

2. Preparations should be made for a trilateral format of talks (Zelensky-Trump-Putin).

3. A ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine.

4. Russia cannot have veto power over Ukraine's EU and Nato membership prospects.

5. Sanctions pressure on Russia will have to be ratcheted up if it does not agree to a ceasefire during the Alaska talks.

""Ukraine and its European partners have agreed on five joint principles regarding peace negotiations and conveyed them to US President Donald Trump,"" the Ukrainian president's official website commented.

For his part, Zelensky voiced confidence after virtual talks with Trump and European leaders that a ceasefire in Ukraine should become a key subject of the Alaska summit.

Reaction to principles

The five principles did not go down well with some Ukrainian commentators.

""Zelensky, Trump and EU leaders agreed on the five principles for talks with Russia. Trump and principles... Trump and agreed on... They are like kids upon my soul!"" journalist Raul Chilachava said on Facebook.

""And what will happen to Donbas? To Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka and Slovyansk? No information,"" blogger and army serviceman Yuriy Kasyanov posted on Facebook.

""Zelensky's new 'peace formula', 'peace summit', 'security guarantees' and 'victory plan' rolled into one,"" an X user commented sarcastically.

Coalition of the Willing

Zelensky hailed the outcome of the sixth meeting of the Coalition of the Willing.

""Together with our partners, we supported the efforts of US President Donald Trump to end the war, stop the killings, and achieve a just and lasting peace. I am grateful to the partners for our shared position: the path to peace cannot be determined without Ukraine, and negotiations can only yield results if they take place under a ceasefire,"" he said on X in English.

""During the meeting, we coordinated the next steps and agreed to continue working in close contact between Ukraine, all of Europe, and the United States. I thank everyone who is working to bring this war to a just end.""

Situation near Dobropillya

The situation around the population centre of Dobropillya, Donetsk Region, where Russian advances were reported in the past days, remains a major media story.

The spokesman for the Dnipro operational-strategic group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, told Suspilne on 13 August that the situation near Dobropillya ""is tense but under control"", with Ukrainian forces seeking to encircle the Russian forces.

The Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has said Manila did not reject China's proposals on managing disputes in the South China Sea, but added that Beijing's suggestions are based on a questionable premise, The Philippine Star website reported.","""We have not rejected any proposals that China has made to us, but the premise is something that we question. The premise that China has made is that their territory follows what is now described as a 10-dash line,"" Marcos said on 12 March at a joint briefing with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.&#160;

""That is not recognized by any country, any international body, certainly not by the Philippines,"" Marcos added.

""Our baselines have been well established for years now. We have the economic zone that China has already intruded upon. And until that premise that China has made in terms of all its discussions with the Philippines, then it's very difficult to see a way forward,"" he noted.

Earlier, China said it had put forward initiatives to the Philippines ""to control the maritime situation and work together"".

A leading Yemeni website has said one person was killed and several others wounded in clashes between worshippers and Yemen&#8217;s Shia&#160;Houthi authorities&#160;at a mosque in the capital Sanaa last on the evening of 17 March.","The anti-Houthi Al-Masdar Online news website reported this morning that the&#160;clashes occurred in the south of the city&#160;after Houthi security forces attempted to stop nightly Ramadan Tarawih prayers in order to broadcast a Houthi leader&#8217;s speech. After mediation from tribal elders, the clashes subsided and a ""siege"" on the Omar Ibn al-Khattab mosque was imposed, Al-Masdar Online said.&#160;

The website said that the ""Houthi militia is waging a massive campaign against Tarawih prayers, which they stipulate must end before 20:30, in order to prepare the areas to listen to the group&#8217;s leader&#8217;s speech, which is broadcast at 21:00, and obliges mosques to broadcast it on a daily basis.""

It said that Houthi forces deploy gunmen at various mosques, to make people congregate and listen to the daily sermon, ""while forcefully stopping any imam who prolongs the prayer beyond 20:30"".

Similar tensions were reported&#160;in Yemeni mosques last year, and Al-Masdar Online also reported days earlier that the Houthis were trying to&#160;impose specific Ramadan practices&#160;associated with Shia Islam in territory under the control that contrasted with practices observed by Yemen&#8217;s Sunni majority.

BBCSAP0020240325ek3p000m9,"Pakistan's Hum TV show on political instability, issues in coalition government","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Newsline"", hosted by anchor Maria Zulfiqar Khan on liberal Hum News TV in Urdu at 17:00 GMT on 24 March 2024. Khan invites analysts and politicians to the show to discuss important issues.

Anchor Maria Zulfiqar Khan commented that running a government amidst the current economic problems is ""not a bed of roses, but a crown of thorns"" and the ruling coalition seems to have realised it very well. She said ""revolutionary measures"" and a completely new approach are needed for implementing an agenda of economic reforms but the question is whether it would be possible for the coalition government to do so.","Khan noted within the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), which is the largest party in the ruling coalition, voices are being raised about it being a mistake to take over the government. She was of the view that this is because party members have realised that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) future politics would be focused on highlighting the alleged injustices done to it and it would also keep criticising the government for its tough decisions.

Khan asked journalist Irshad Bhatti to share his views on the PML-N apparently regretting its decision to take over the government. Bhatti commented ""the biggest challenge for the government is the government itself"" because the country is facing the worst economic and political crisis and both these crises are ""supplementing each other"". He said there is no hope that the government would improve the economy and claimed no country trusts it. He added whatever steps are to be taken for the economy would be taken by the military. He alleged there is a power struggle going on within the Sharif family.

Bhatti further alleged there is a rift between Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif; another rift is between the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the federal government; and there is yet another rift between the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N, particularly over privatisation of state enterprises. He added another rift has emerged between Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb and former finance minister Ishaq Dar.

Senior journalist Sana Bucha commented this is not a government but a ""standby agreement or a standby adjustment phase"" through which the country is passing. She appreciated Mohsin Naqvi's performance as the former chief minister of Punjab and said it is good that he is the interior minister now. She added Naqvi has ""zero interests politically and personally"", so he would be on the right path.

Talking about Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Bucha said he wants what he considers to be ""his share in the government"" and that is why he was being given the chairmanship of an economic coordination committee. She was of the view that if the PTI wanted to come into power, it should have made a coalition government along with the PPP, but it ""only wanted to keep making noise"".

Senior analyst Raza Rumi said at the moment, governance in the country is in the ""grip of factionalism"" and various ""factions"" within the PML-N-led government and power centres are exercising their influence. He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is trying to take several factions along, so it looks like people would see a ""struggling prime minister"" in the coming months. He remarked it should be kept in mind that coalition governments always work in this manner.

Commenting on inclusion of Mohsin Naqvi in the cabinet and appointment of former caretaker interior minister Sarfraz Bugti as the chief minister of Balochistan, Rumi said these appointments are ""against the spirit of the Constitution"" because caretakers should not join the government formed after elections. He was of the view that running the government would be difficult for the prime minister and the present situation is ""not good for the future of democracy"" in the country.

Bhatti said Ishaq Dar has been appointed as the foreign minister at a time when the ""foreign image of Pakistan is very bad"" and all the battles are to be fought on the foreign policy front. He noted friendly countries are no longer willing to provide financial support to Pakistan.

Khan played a clip of a statement by PTI politician Asad Qaiser, who said the PTI would launch a protest movement and not let the government ""sit in peace"". Commenting on the situation, Bhatti insisted political stability would not be possible without holding talks with the PTI or its founder Imran Khan. He added there is a need for a ""charter of Pakistan"".

Rumi remarked political stability has never been there in Pakistan, except during the years under the military's rule, so people should not be ""idealistic"" in this regard. He was of the view that the ""hybrid system"" which has been created would work for the time being. He said the present government could be changed if the PTI decides to give up its narrative that it would not talk to other parties and forms a coalition. However, he added, the PTI is not likely to change its stance because its popularity depends on the narrative that it is the only ""clean party"" and all other politicians are ""thieves and robbers"".

The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.","Anchor Nadeem Malik said the government has announced constitution of a commission under the Commission of Inquiry Act to look into the issues raised in a letter by six judges of the Islamabad High Court. He noted the commission would be headed by a retired judge. He remarked Pakistan's history shows that the government forms a committee on matters it has ""no intention to take action against"" and forms a commission on matters which it wants to ""bury"". Noting that the present government has opted to form a commission, he said he would not question the government because it is ""very weak"" and is ""dependent on the [military] establishment"", but he would question why the Supreme Court did not take a suo moto notice and decided to hear the case in an open court.

Malik insisted the Supreme Court should take action in this matter and there is a need to set some standard operating procedures. He said Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa has an opportunity to take action to end the interference of government and intelligence agencies in judicial matters and ensure that judges issue judgements by meeting requirements of the due process of justice.

Malik spoke with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) politician Salman Akram Raja and asked him about the way forward. Raja remarked the way forward is very clear and the letter by the judges has identified it. He said allegations have been levelled against the executive and its subordinate officers, and it is clear that the executive cannot conduct an investigation against itself, so a judicial commission needs to be formed.

Raja was of the view that the Supreme Court should have initiated proceedings under suo moto or contempt jurisdiction. He said not just the PTI, but all political parties should play a role in taking this matter to a ""logical conclusion"". He urged the civil society and human rights defenders to also raise their voice against this issue. He insisted the commission announced by the government on 28 March is ""insufficient"" because it would not be able to reach any conclusion and demanded that a judicial commission should be constituted. He said the judiciary should have fulfilled its responsibility in this matter, otherwise it would be considered a ""failure"" on its behalf.

Raja claimed interference in judicial affairs has been present in all cases of ""political nature"" and some judges appear to be scared, while others show courage. He warned if judges are not free to give judgements without any pressure or threat, the country would not be able to progress.

Independent politician Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said as a lawyer, he is disappointed by the announcement regarding the government forming a commission because he expected the Supreme Court to take a suo moto notice in the case and hold an open proceeding. He claimed the government is just a ""rubber stamp"" and it is useless to hand this matter over to it. He noted the allegations are very serious and have raised questions over the entire judicial system.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Khurram Dastgir said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stepped forward as the ""elected representative of the people"" and has taken a responsibility which does not directly fall under his duties. He noted the responsibility to take up this matter was on the judiciary because the letter had been addressed to it.

Dastgir said details of the allegations are yet to be gathered and the commission which has been announced should be allowed to do its work and ""prove through its conduct"" that it would take up the issue seriously. He was hopeful that the letter written by the six judges will help in ""taking Pakistan forward"". He remarked the present situation is a ""test of the political wisdom"" of all political players. He was of the view that ""partial justice"" will not work and it cannot be said that only the cases concluded in the last one year are wrong, while judgements in the earlier cases should be accepted.

Highlights","- Intermediate coverage highlighting developments in Maldives, China ties

- Extensive coverage of political narratives on forthcoming elections

- Intermediate coverage of alleged gang rape of foreign tourist

Maldives, China ties&#160;

Privately-owned, nationalist English-language TV news channel, WION,&#160;on its show ""Gravitas"" (at 21:00 IST or 15:30 GMT)&#160;highlighted Indian concerns over ties between the Maldives and China.

The anchor said, ""India and China are ready for war in the Indian Ocean. Tension is building up not too far from the Indian mainland. In the Maldives, China is laying the foundation for an outpost and Beijing has signed a secret defence deal with Male.""

The anchor added, ""What this deal encompasses, one cannot tell for sure and China will not tell. Meet Mohamed Ghassan - he is the Defence Minister of Maldives and he met with Zhang Baoqun, who is China's deputy director of international military cooperation. The two men met in Male. They shook hands and signed the deal.""

The anchor mentioned, ""The elated Ministry of Defence of the Maldives then announced that China will be providing military assistance to the Maldives. But the question is at what cost and in exchange for what? Perhaps using the Maldives as an outpost?""

The anchor added, ""What Male is failing to see here is that this is not a friendly neighbour trying to help a poor island nation. The dragon's [China's] designs are not benign and it's not seeking a partnership with the Maldives. China, in fact, is preparing for war with India in the Indian Ocean and it is looking for a platform.""

The anchor also said, ""The Maldives and its dreams of partnership with China are just collateral damage, serving as nothing but a platform for China to set up a base in India's backyard.""

Another privately-owned, prominent English-language TV news channel, NDTV 24X7, on its show, ""Left, Right & Centre"" (at 21:30 IST or 16:00 GMT) also highlighted this development.

Anchor Vishnu Som said, ""The equation between India and the Maldives, which has been fairly testy over the last couple of months, seems to have hit a new roadblock with the government of [Maldivian President] President Mohamed Muizzu signing a new agreement with China where China has apparently offered free military aid to Male.""

Som added, ""This comes at a time when the Chinese 'spy ships', 'research vessels' is what they call them, have been docking in Maldivian ports. It also comes at a time when there's been concerns raised by the Maldivian opposition on what exactly the President is doing.""

He further mentioned, ""The President making it quite clear that China is the country that he sees equations with, perhaps most closely. India not in that equation, at least not in the way it once was. What's more, the Maldives has made it clear that they want Indian [military] personnel off the island.""

Speaking on the show, Dr RK Radhakrishnan, India-based expert on Maldives, said, ""A lot has changed&#8230; The couple of people [opposition leaders] who had backed the motion [against President Muizzu] had backed out because Muizzu offered them ministerships or good positions in government&#8230; Number two, the delay in the election [reportedly from March to now in April]&#8230; gives Muizzu enough and more time to actually come with a coercive response to the Indian offer that civilians will replace military personnel in the Island.""

Political narratives on general elections&#160; &#160;

Privately-owned, pro-government English-language TV news channel, India Today, on its show, ""News Today"" (at 21:10 IST or 15:40 GMT) discussed political narratives regarding the forthcoming general elections.

Anchor Rajdeep Sardesai asked Rahul Verma of think tank Centre for Policy Research, ""You are hearing the Prime Minister [PM] Narendra Modi go across the country on this whistle-stop tour, speaking of his dream of a 'developed India'. Of course, he attacks the opposition on familialism and other issues but the core of his appeal is 'I am going to give you [people] a dream of a stronger, stable India'.""

""On the other hand, [opposition Congress party leader] Rahul Gandhi, on his 'Nyaya Yatra' [march for justice] is going along raising issues like&#8230; people are unemployed and that the&#8230; [people from so-called lower castes] are losing out. So, you have two clear narratives emerging. How do you see this playing out politically?"" he added.

Verma said, ""What we saw in that survey ['Mood of the Nation' survey conducted by the channel] that there is a disjunction between what voters think on questions relating to economy and how they are behaving politically. Price rise, unemployment there was [of] high concern. There was support for [a] nationwide caste census&#8230; A large number of people agree with these issues but on the political side, they seem to be thinking that [the] Modi government is doing well."" &#160;

He said, ""PM Modi remains popular and people are much more likely to vote for BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] in comparison to [the] past. So, what this suggests that perhaps voters do not have enough trust on opposition to be able to deliver on some of those issues which concern them.""

Another popular, pro-government Hindi TV news channel, Aaj Tak, on its show ""Black and White"" (at 21:15 IST or 15:45 GMT) also focused on this news.

Anchor Sudhir Chaudhary said, ""Are opposition parties trying to win the [lower house of parliament] Lok Sabha election by insulting [Hindu deity] Lord Ram and Hinduism? Is it not that while criticising PM Modi and protesting against them, these opposition leaders have in fact now started to insult Lord Ram himself?""

Chaudhary added, ""[southern state] Tamil Nadu's DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] party MP and former UPA [United Progressive Alliance government] minister A Raja, in his new statement, has said that he does not believe in Lord Ram and [Hindu epic] Ramayana and does not even believe that [Hindu deity] Lord Hanuman is a god.""

He mentioned, ""DMK is the same party whose leader Udhayanidhi Stalin had compared Hinduism with diseases such as dengue and malaria. DMK's MP Senthilkumar had said that the people of north India are simply confined to cows and 'gau mutra' [cow urine]. And now, the same party's MP A Raja, while taking advantage of freedom of expression, is mocking Lord Hanuman and using insulting words for Lord Ram.""

Alleged gang rape of foreign tourist

Prominent, privately-owned pro-government Hindi TV news channel, Zee News, on its show, ""DNA"" (at 21:20 IST or 15:50 GMT) reported about the alleged gang rape of a foreign tourist.

The anchor said, ""In Indian culture, we have the tradition of treating the guest as God, which means that if a guest comes to our home, we should welcome them like we would welcome God&#8230; But the thinking of some people has been polluted so badly that instead of treating guests [of the country] as God, they don't even shy away from committing crimes against them.""

Pope Francis' call for Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war with Russia has been welcomed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who added that the pontiff's position was ""understandable"".","Peskov had been asked at his 11 March press briefing to comment on Pope Francis' recent remark that Kyiv should have ""the courage to raise the white flag"" and enter talks with Moscow - a comment that has been criticised in Ukraine.

""In general, the point that he expressed, of course, is quite understandable. He spoke in favour of negotiations. You know that our president has repeatedly spoken about our readiness and openness to solve our problems through negotiations. And this is preferable,"" Peskov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

However, Peskov continued, Moscow does not expect Ukraine to act on the Pope's suggestion.

""You know, unfortunately, that both the Pope's statements and the repeated statements of other parties, including ours, have recently been met with absolutely firm rejection by the Kyiv regime, and they do not allow for the possibility of conducting any negotiations,"" Peskov said.

BBCMNF0020240315ek3f001ba,IS claims killing senior al-Qaeda commander in Mali,"By BBC Monitoring

Islamic State (IS) group has said it killed a senior al-Qaeda commander it captured in an ambush in Mali's north-eastern Gao region.","IS published a photo purporting to show the captured figure, &#160;named ""Ilyas "" (also spelled Iliassou, aka Amadou Moussa), before his death.

The group made the claim on 14 March in an ""exclusive"" report by its weekly newspaper al-Naba (issue 434). It came as part of a roundup of the activities of IS's Sahel branch.&#160;

A privately-owned Malian newspaper reported on 12 March that the al-Qaeda commander was killed in clashes with IS in Intillit (also spelled N'Tillit) in Gao on 9 March.

IS said its ambush followed an al-Qaeda raid on ""the village of Zorani in Gao, to the west of Niger River"" on 6 March, in which militants stole money and cattle from residents ""under the claim"" that they supported IS.

Al-Naba said IS militants responded with an ambush to take revenge and retrieve the stolen items, but did not specify whether that happened on the same day or later.

It said IS militants set up an ambush near a village rendered as ""Ousadia"" in Ansongo, Gao, to target the al-Qaeda militants on their way back to their areas.&#160;

The ambush, it said, prompted clashes that resulted in the killing of 16 al-Qaeda fighters, ""while the rest fled"".

Al-Naba said that it was during those clashes that IS militants captured four al-Qaeda members, including the senior al-Qaeda commander, and later killed them.

It said his name was ""Ilyas"" and that he was a ""leading"" al-Qaeda official in Gao who had ""a track record of crimes against Muslims in general and the mujahidin [IS] in particular"".

""After interrogating him, the mujahidin killed him, along with the other captured [al-Qaeda] members, using machine guns, and rid Muslims of his evil"", al-Naba said.

To support its claim, al-Naba featured a photo (above) that it said showed Ilyas and the three other al-Qaeda fighters sitting on the ground with militants behind them ready to shoot. The faces of the captives were shown (blurred by BBC Monitoring) but the faces of the militants behind them was blurred by al-Naba.&#160;

The IS newspaper said that the group's militants eventually retrieved the money allegedly stolen by the al-Qaeda raiders and ""returned it to its owners"" in the village.

Sudan&#8217;s ruling Sovereign Council member Gen&#160;Ibrahim&#160;Jabir&#160;Ibrahim has said that the military would form &#8220;a technocratic government&#8221; to run the affairs of the country until elections are held, state-owned Sudan News Agency (Suna) has reported.","Ibrahim made the remarks on 25 March while addressing the officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division of the armed forces in the eastern city of Gedaref.

&#8220;Our clear message to the politicians is that there will be a non-political transitional period in which the country would be governed by a technocratic government that would manage the affairs of the Sudanese people and prepare for elections,&#8221; Ibrahim said.

He added that &#8220;the armed forces will not enter any agreement with politicians.&#8221;

Ibrahim's remarks came days after another Sovereign Council member, Lt Gen&#160;Yasir al-Atta,&#160;said the army would not cede power to civilian groups until after elections are held in the country.

But Gen Atta also urged&#160;pro-army activist groups to form a government to run the country in a move that would have excluded former civilian coalition the&#160;Forces of Freedom and Change&#160;(FFC), which shared power the army before the October 2021 coup.

The army accuses FFC of backing the paramilitary&#160;Rapid Support Forces but the group denies the allegation.

Zelensky, US envoy discuss Russia sanctions

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US envoy Keith Kellogg yesterday discussed sanctions and tariff pressure on Russia, as well as other ways to force Moscow into peace negotiations, the United News TV marathon said this morning.

""President Zelensky once again confirmed that Ukraine is ready for the format of leaders, but stressed that Moscow must also be ready,"" the TV said.

They also discussed arms procurement, drones and the return of children abducted by Russia.

""Ukraine is deeply grateful to the United States for its support, and we value that President Trump @POTUS is so determined to achieve real peace,"" Zelensky said on X. ""It is very important to realize all the results - political, defense, and economic - that were achieved during our meeting together with European leaders in Washington.""

Ukraine expands on security guarantees

In a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and European colleagues, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha ""reiterated Ukraine's position that security guarantees must be concrete, legally binding, and effective"".

""They should be multidimensional, including military, diplomatic, legal, and other levels,"" he said on X. ""We all share the conviction that the Ukrainian army is the fundamental level of any such guarantees, therefore its maximum strengthening is our top priority.""

""Moscow must know that it cannot drag its feet forever. If Russia continues to reject meaningful, constructive steps toward peace, it must face consequences: severe increase in sanctions and strengthening for Ukraine's capabilities,"" he said.

Other diplomatic activity

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal yesterday visited a drone manufacturer, the TV marathon reported this morning.

Shmyhal announced that Norway would provide $8.5bn to Ukraine in 2026, most of which would be spent on military equipment. He called on other partner countries to also invest in Ukraine's rapidly growing defence industry.

Norway also helps procure Patriot missile systems for Ukraine and provides military training, Shmyhal said.

Ukraine consulting Poland over Starlink funding

The Ukrainian Digital Transformation Ministry is in talks with Poland after President Karol Nawrocki yesterday vetoed a bill which provides financial support for unemployed Ukrainian citizens, including child benefits and public healthcare, the Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne has reported, quoting the ministry's press service.

Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on X that the veto de-facto ends Polish funding for the Starlink satellite systems for Ukraine.

""Karol Nawrocki's decision turns off the Internet in Ukraine,"" he said. ""I can't imagine a better gift for Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet, which the President has just decided.""

Nawrocki also said yesterday that he would table a bill banning the promotion of ""Banderism"", referring to the ideology of Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera.

Both decisions triggered shock in Ukraine.

Journalist-turned-serviceman Taras Berezovets said on Telegram that Polish independence fighter Jozef Pilsudski would be ashamed of his descendants for passing the move on Starlink.

Ukrainian historian and former head of the Ukrainian National Remembrance Institute, Volodymyr Vyatrovych, said on Facebook that Nawrocki's remarks on ""Bandera ideology"" are ""similar to Putin's, who refers to destruction of all things Ukrainian as de-Nazification"".

Nationalist former MP Dmytro Yarosh, writing on Facebook, urged Nawrocki not to destroy Ukrainian-Polish ""friendship"" and not to take ""Moscow's side"".

Court orders incumbent lawmaker to pay decreed debt

The Civil Court on 29 February ordered incumbent Member of Parliament for Dhuvaafaru constituency, Ismail Ahmed, to settled 856,830 rufiyaa ($55,566) in outstanding payments to Ismail Haleel, a sub-contractor. The court, in its ruling, said Ahmed had entered a contract (in 2018) to construct three classrooms in Kandoodhoo School in Thaa Atoll and made a verbal agreement with Haleel to implement the project in 2018. The contract was valued at 1.2m rufiyaa ($84,306), of which Ahmed had paid 425,000 rufiyaa ($27,567). The Civil Court issued the ruling in absentia as Ahmed had failed to appear in court or responded to the court, after accepting the summons. Ahmed is currently campaigning for the upcoming parliament election in his current constituency, on a ticket from opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). Under the constitution, a decreed debt and failure to pay the debt will result in the lawmaker not meeting the conditions required to be a member of parliament. As such, if Ahmed fails to pay the outstanding within 15 days of the ruling, his seat may be at risk. [Online, Approximate Words: 180]

An Iranian court has endorsed the death penalty for a local police chief found guilty of killing a man in a street gathering in the northern town of Bandar Anzali after the Iran-US football match in the 2022 Qatar World Cup.","The reformist Sharq daily said on 27 March that a military court in Qazvin province approved the penalty that had been issued by a court in Gilan, a province in the north of Iran, where the local police chief Col Jafar Javanmardi shot Mehran Sammak dead in 2022.

Sharq quoted Majid Ahmadi, the lawyer for Sammak's family, as saying that the Qazvin court reinvestigated the case and endorsed the sentence issued by the Gilan court.

He added the convict now faces ""qisas"" - a judicial retribution penalty in the Iranian penal system - which carries the death penalty in murder cases, unless the victim's family agree to pardon him.

On 15 January, following the defendant's appeal, the Supreme Court overturned the death sentence, tasking the Qazvin court to study the case and issue a final verdict.

Sammak died of pellet gun wounds during celebrations on 30 November following the defeat of Iran's national team in the football match against the US, where some people engaged in street celebrations, mocking the establishment in the aftermath of Mahsa Amini protests.

Iran has rarely punished security forces members in the cases of killing or wounding citizens or protesters.

An editorial in English-language newspaper Pakistan Observer has expressed concern over the hike in food prices and called for 'proactive measures' to keep prices stable during the Ramadan in Pakistan.","Pakistan Observer is a prominent English-language daily and generally takes a pro-military stance.

""As the holy month of Ramazan [also known as Ramadan] begins, people are bracing themselves for customary extra hike in food prices - over and above the two-digit inflationary spiral that the country has been facing for almost four years,"" it said.

""It is disheartening to witness how essential kitchen items such as vegetables, fruits, sugar, edible oil, ghee, meat, eggs and pulses are subjected to substantial price hikes by unscrupulous traders, further exacerbating the economic hardships faced by many. Also unbridled export of meat and vegetables has further strained domestic prices,"" it added.

According to the paper the ""the recent surge in prices, averaging at 31.5%, with some items witnessing up to a staggering 60% increase, is not justifiable, especially during a month that emphasizes compassion and communal care.""

Comparing Pakistan to other countries, the editorial highlighted that &#160;in ""several European nations, efforts are made to reduce the prices of essential items during Ramazan, recognising the significance of this month to Muslim communities. However, in our country, instead of easing burden on consumers, traders and retailers exploit this period to maximise their profits, disregarding the principles of fairness and empathy.""

Calling for government action, the editorial said that ""it is important for both federal and provincial governments to take proactive measures to ensure stable prices during Ramazan.""

Also calling for stringer measures, the paper added that ""price control committees must be fully activated and empowered to crack down on profiteers who seek to exploit this month for personal gain. Strict enforcement of regulations and penalties for price manipulation are essential to deter such unethical practices.""

It also called upon provincial governments to ""ensure sale of quality items at special Ramazan bazaars"".&#160;

""Traders and retailers must recognise the sanctity of this time and exercise caution in their business practices. Instead of exploiting the heightened demand for essential items, they should embrace the principles of empathy and fairness, ensuring that consumers are not burdened unjustly,"" it added.

&#160;","Iran's deputy defence minister has provided further information on the Abu Mahdi cruise missiles delivered to the Navy last year.

In a phone call with Fars News Agency on 23 March, Afshin Naderi Sharif said that the missile uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to counter electronic warfare through adjusting its trajectory. It also aids in recognising the topographic structures of terrains and distinguishing between the right and wrong targets.

Naderi Sharif, who serves as the deputy defence minister for research and technology, revealed more details about the Abu Mahdi missile.

He described the 1,000-km range of the missile as its most important feature, enabling the Iranian military to confront ""enemies"" from deep inside the country and forcing the ""enemy"" to stand more than 1,000 km away from Iran's borders.

He added that the missile was capable of flying at low altitudes and therefore evade radar detection.

The missile's manoeuvrability, enabling it to strike targets from multiple directions, was its other main characteristic, Naderi Sharif noted.

The deputy defence minister underscored the ""new"" explosive used in the warhead of the missile which gave it greater destructive forces.

He said hybrid ""seekers"" (sensors), comprising of active and passive devices, have been mounted on the missile which enabled it to detect and hit the target with small cross-sections. The missile seeker is a component inside a missile that generates data to be fed into the missile computer.

""Active"" seekers emit signals and gather data after these signals are reflected off the targets; ""passive"" seekers just detect the energy emitted by the target in the form of light or heat.

Iran unveiled the Abu Mahdi missile in 2020, named after Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis killed in a US air strike alongside top Iranian commander Lt Gen Qasem Soleimani earlier the same year.

Zelensky arrives in Washington for talks with Trump

President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Washington where he is scheduled to meet Donald Trump and a number of European leaders later in the day.

""I am grateful to @POTUS for the invitation. We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably. And peace must be lasting. Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East - part of Donbas - and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack,"" Zelensky said on X in English.

Zelensky noted the Ukrainian army's ""successes"" in Sumy and Donetsk regions.

""I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance. Russia must end this war, which it itself started. And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace,"" he said.

On 17 August, Zelensky Zelensky took part in a meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing ahead of his talks with Trump and said that Ukraine-Russia talks to end the war should take into account the current line of contact while any territorial issues can be discussed only with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a trilateral meeting involving the US.

Concern in Ukraine ahead of talks with Trump

A number of media outlets, including the ZN.ua website, republished a Bild article according to which Zelensky will first meet Trump one-on-one and only later they will be joined by European leaders - UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

""One cannot rule out an escalation in the White House,"" ZN.ua warned, referring to the Zelensky-Trump row in February of this year.

""It seems that the Ukrainian president will have to make some concessions under pressure from circumstances,"" the TSN.ua website said in an article headlined ""A new scandal or step to ending the war: what one should expect from the Trump-Zelensky meeting"".

The website noted that a year ago Zelensky said that Ukraine ""will never agree to any option of frozen conflict"", while yesterday the Ukrainian leader said that ""real negotiations"" can start ""where the current line of contact is"".

TSN.ua also noted that Zelensky will be accompanied by ""a powerful support group"" of the European leaders.

Ukrainians welcome participation of Europeans in Washington talks

The Glavred website described the participation of European leaders in the talks as ""a European landing operation in Washington"".

""European leaders are concerned that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may not get from the US leader the same friendly treatment as Vladimir Putin did. Therefore, the EU decided to bolster Kyiv's chances at the meeting,"" the Telegraf website commented.

""European leaders are going to strengthen Volodymyr Zelensky's delegation in the USA,"" the Censor.net website said on Facebook.

Former MP Boryslav Bereza hailed the fact that Zelensky will be supported by ""adults"" at the talks. However, he warned that Zelensky should not take to the White House his chief of staff Andriy Yermak.

""Yermak must not attend this meeting. He is disrespected in the White House and irritates US politicians with his primitivism,"" Bereza said on Facebook.

Pundit and army serviceman Kyrylo Sazonov predicted that the talks with Trump would be ""very difficult"".

""This meeting is more important than the Trump-Putin talks. Good luck, Mr president. You definitely need it now,"" he said on Facebook.

Step by step, Chisinau takes away our powers, cuts out budget, violates legitimate rights, provokes instability and destabilisation of Gagauzia and the entire country.

The Russian leader promised to support Gagauzia and its people in defending their legitimate rights, powers and position on the international arena,"" she said in the post.

The pro-European media criticised the Moldovan delegations at the festival, which represent the pro-Russian opposition parties, for attending it and thus ""showing support for the Russian war against Ukraine"".

The programme invites experts and politicians to express their opinions and analysis on important news of the day.

Anchor Shahzada Zulfiqar said the government is making efforts to improve the economy of the country and for this purpose, it has proposed the Tajir Dost (trader-friendly) scheme to expand and bring small traders into the tax net. He added the government has also planned to float a Panda Bond worth $300m in the Chinese market.","Zulfiqar spoke with Aminullah Kakar, deputy commissioner of inland revenue in Quetta, and asked him to explain the Tajir Dost scheme. Kakar said it is a scheme to bring small traders in the retail sector under the tax net. He noted even though traders and shopkeepers contribute to the economy of the country, they have no contribution in the taxes. He mentioned first the retailers would be registered and then tax collection would be started from 1 July.

Kakar said other sectors like agriculture and service sector are also not included in revenue collection and the government is now trying to bring them under the tax net. He noted the government has made the system easier for traders. He emphasised ""tax culture"" should be promoted in the country and said automation and digitisation of the tax collection system are needed.

Zulfiqar asked journalist Mehtab Haider about the objective of the tax scheme for retailers. Haider said similar schemes were introduced in the past as well and this time a new effort has been made to launch a ""simple and easy"" scheme. He mentioned the registration process would begin from 1 April and tax collection would be started from 1 July. He noted the number of retailers in Pakistan is around 3.5 million and the scheme is being launched in six major cities in its first phase. Talking about Pakistan's plan to float the Panda Bond, he said the government has decided to tap into the Chinese market by launching these bonds.

Zulfiqar asked Nawabzada Riaz Nosherwani, chief executive officer of the Royal Minerals Company, to comment on the new tax measures. Nosherwani said taxation is a ""two-way traffic"" and noted the mining business in Balochistan is the highest contributor to the revenue. He mentioned raw materials like iron ore, manganese, and chromite are exported and the government collects additional taxes on this export. He appreciated the government for finally announcing some steps to support the mining sector.

Nosherwani said the government's focus is more on foreign investment and argued that consortiums of local investors should be encouraged because foreign investors take money out of the country. He noted lengthy bureaucratic procedures and lack of continuity in policy are the major hurdles for foreign investors in Pakistan. He was of the view that Pakistan should try to look at other countries besides China for investments in the country.

Zulfiqar asked Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) politician Sakina Abdullah Khan how her party views the situation of terrorism in the country and how far the National Action Plan against terrorism approved in 2014 has been implemented. Khan said the 20 points of the National Action Plan include clauses regarding ""criminal justice"". She noted security agencies take action and catch militants, but the justice system is not able to punish those elements, so they are released. She insisted these ""flaws in the mechanism"" require changes through legislation.

Khan noted ""terror groups"" have been banned but they re-emerge with new names. She further noted Islamic seminaries have been registered and regulated but there is a need to bring changes in the curriculum of mainstream schools as well. She said websites of the banned groups have been blocked but freedom of expression of other people should not be curtailed in this process. She appreciated the new Chief Minister of Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti (PPP member) for having an ""excellent experience"" as the home minister of the province and managing it well.

Pratika Rawal sealed her place instead as the likely opening partner for vice-captain Smriti Mandhana.","India will be led by Harmanpreet Kaur at the Sept. 30-Nov. 2 Women's World Cup.

Verma featured for India A in Australia, but Rawal’s form – 703 runs in 14 innings since her debut in December -- helped secure the spot.

Jemimah Rodrigues makes the cut after missing out in 2022 – a first ODI World Cup appearance for the star batter. No. 3 Harleen Deol, allrounders Amanjot Kaur and Arundhati Reddy, left-arm spinners Radha Yadav and Sree Charani, and pacer Kranti Goud will also feature in their first World Cup.

Host India will open its World Cup campaign against Sri Lanka on Sept. 30. The game was slated to be played in Bengaluru, but a change in venue is anticipated because of the post-IPL tragedy involving Royal Challengers Bengaluru where 11 fans lost their lives in a stampede. An ICC announcement is expected this week.

Bengaluru was also supposed to host the final on Nov. 2, and that could also be changed.

Colombo will host the final if Pakistan qualifies. Pakistan will play all its games in Sri Lanka, including against India on Oct. 5.

India will play three ODIs with Australia – on Sept. 14, 17 and 20 – in the buildup to the World Cup.

The law allows Indian citizenship to ""persecuted"" non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who entered India before 31 December 2014.

Pakistan alleged that minorities in India were facing ""victimisation"".

""The rising wave of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] under the BJP [India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party] government has led to rapid political, economic and social victimisation of Muslims and other religious and social minorities, including Dalits [those at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy],&#8221; FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zehra Baloch said at a weekly press briefing on 14 March.&#160;

The ""attempted"" incursion of anti-Kremlin Russian paramilitary groups from Ukrainian territory was the top story for all three channels, which relayed official Russian assurances that the Ukrainian ""terrorists"" and ""saboteurs"" were not allowed to cross into Russia and suffered grievous losses.","In updates about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the channels said Russian forces had taken yet another village in Donbass and destroyed more Western equipment.

Newly elected UK MP George Galloway and US TV personality Tucker Carlson were shown parroting the Kremlin's propaganda narratives on Ukraine, while Russian Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin appeared to threaten Germany over possible deliveries of Taurus missiles to Kyiv.

In a lengthy Rossiya 1 report about Putin meeting the next generation of Russian managerial talent, the president was shown casually admitting that Russian oil production is falling and Russia is at risk of losing its traditional markets. Another Rossiya 1 report said that despite ""external pressure"", the Russian economy is showing a strong and accelerating growth.

Incursion from Ukraine

All three channels led with what they described as an attempted but unsuccessful cross-border raid into Russia's Belgorod and Kursk regions by Ukrainian ""terrorists"" and ""saboteurs"".

The attempt was a ""complete failure"" and the ""Ukrainian terrorist formations"" were not allowed to cross into Russia, losing hundreds of men, seven tanks and several armoured vehicles, including US-supplied Bradley IFVs, state-controlled Channel One told its viewers.

Footage of damaged or destroyed armoured vehicles was shown to corroborate these claims, but it is not immediately clear where or when that footage was recorded.

Ukrainian claims that anti-Kremlin paramilitary groups manned by Russian nationals had turned Russian border guards to flight and seized a village in Kursk Region were dismissed as enemy propaganda.

""While Ukrainian tanks were burning, Kyiv propagandists were posting videos supposedly showing terrorists crossing the Russian border, but what the videos actually showed were ordinary passers-by,"" Channel One said.

It also showed what it said was footage from the Russian villages which the anti-Kremlin paramilitaries had earlier claimed to have seized. The footage shows that the Russian military are fully in control of both villages and there is no sign of any fighting there, Channel One's presenter said.

Another Ukrainian village seized, Galloway and Carlson parrot Kremlin propaganda

In other Ukraine-related news, the three channels relayed the Russian MoD's report that Russian forces had seized the Donbas village of Nevelske, continued to make steady advances on other stretches of the front, and destroyed valuable Western equipment, including another Himars MRL system.

Turning to the subject of Western support for Ukraine, state-owned Rossiya 1 showed newly elected UK MP George Galloway warning (in a Russian voiceover) that Russia will use all the weapons it has in its arsenals in the event of an ""existential threat"", and that French President Macron and other European leaders who ""fantasise"" about getting directly involved in the war in Ukraine will be completely defeated.

Over on Channel One, US TV personality Tucker Carlson, lionised by the pro-Kremlin media as an eminent US voice of reason, was shown arguing that US sanctions against Russia break international rules and undermine the world's confidence in the US dollar.

Rossiya 1 and Channel One also showed Russian Duma speaker urging the German Bundestag to investigate the audio leak on which top German officers are heard discussing possible use of Taurus missiles for a strike against the Kerch Bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland.

The involvement of German officers in such discussions is seen in Russia as ""aggression and a threat to our security"", and Russia ""has what it takes to respond to such threats"", including ""the most advanced, high-tech weapons"" which no other country has, Vyacheslav Volodin was shown saying on Channel One.

Putin admits falling Russian oil production

With only a few days remaining until the Russian presidential election, all three channels aired lengthy reports about Vladimir Putin attending a forum of the next generation of Russian managerial and state governance talent.

The reports mostly highlighted Putin's banter with the event's participants and their words of praise for the Russian leader - but on Rossiya 1, he was also shown casually admitting in a chat with a relatively youthful deputy energy minister that Russian oil production is declining and Russia risks losing its traditional oil markets.

""Opec+ is really helping us to keep the oil prices [high], generating revenue for our treasury, but our oil production is in fact falling,"" Putin was shown saying.

""And because production is falling [in Russia] but rising in other countries, such as the United States, we risk losing our markets,"" the president went on.

The Russian government imposed a one-year ban on the publication of oil and gas production statistics in April 2023. On 7 March, Interfax news agency said the ban had been extended until 1 April 2025.

Russian economy said to be growing strongly

In other economic news, Rossiya 1 showed Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announcing that Russian GDP grew at an annualised rate of 4.6% in January 2024, up from the 3.5% growth reported for the whole of 2023.

""The Russian economy is successfully adapting to the challenges, regardless of the external pressure,"" Rossiya 1 told its viewers.

His address was preceded by an address from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Raisi said the Gaza war showed how ""standing up to the enemy"" resulted in their ""failure"", even though Israel was equipped with ""the newest arms and billions of dollars"".

He said the Kerman attack in January, which killed at least 96 people, was the ""enemy's revenge"" against Iran ""for their own regional failure"". ""Iran was wounded in heart, but it remained strong,"" he added.

The Islamic State group (IS) claimed responsibility for the Kerman attack, but Iranian officials maintain that the jihadist group is a product of the US and its allies' policies.

Raisi also said that ""the enemy's plan to boycott the elections"" also failed, referring to the 1 March parliamentary and Assembly of Experts&#160;elections. The elections were marked by a record low 41% turnout, but officials and hardline media still celebrated the turnout as a success.

Raisi also mentioned the 2022 nationwide protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in morality police custody, describing them as ""the enemy's failed imposed sedition"".

He also praised Iran's supposed economic progress and said there had been some $11bn in foreign investment in the past year. He boasted of Iran's expansion of international ties, including its joining of the Brics group of nations.

The cancellation of subsidised air ticket sales has caused a public outcry. The local government spokesperson, Dmitry Lyskov, claimed that the sales are frozen for a programme overhaul, not due to funding shortages. Consequently, until 1 May, Kaliningrad's pensioners, students, and others must pay full fares. Lyskov said the situation is misrepresented, arguing that subsidised tickets were previously hard to obtain due to flaws in the system. (New Kaliningrad website, 10 March 24)

The outlawed&#160;Tajik&#160;opposition movement&#160;Group 24 has said in a statement that its leader, Suhrob Zafar, has been missing in Turkey's Istanbul since 10 March, the Prague-based private&#160;Tajik&#160;website Bomdod.com reported on 11 March.&#160;","According to the statement, the opposition leader has been unreachable since the morning of 10 March and his phone is also switched off. ""No information is available about him and his whereabouts,"" it said.&#160;The statement added that Zafar, who has been living in Turkey since 2014, has been ""receiving threatening messages"" that ""he will soon be killed or kidnapped and taken to Tajikistan"".

This is the second case of a Group 24 member going missing in Istanbul over recent months. Nasimjon Sharifov, 39, another representative of Group 24 went missing on 23 February&#160;and his whereabouts remain unknown.&#160;

The Turkish police had arrested both Zafar and Sharipov several times at the request of the&#160;Tajik&#160;authorities. However, Turkey rejected the request to extradite them to&#160;Tajikistan due to the fact that their cases were ""politically motivated"", and released them.

""So far the Tajik authorities have never succeeded in returning Group 24 members in Turkey via official means, that is through extradition. For this reason, his comrades do not rule out that Suhrob Zafar has been abducted,"" Bomdod noted.

Group 24 was set up by businessman-turned-opposition leader Umarali Quvvatov, who was killed in Istanbul in 2015, a year after the Tajik Supreme Court outlawed his organisation as ""extremist"". Dozens of people have been convicted and jailed in Tajikistan for membership in the group.

Last year, Tajikistan helped Turkey to kidnap two natives of Turkey, who were accused of having links to exiled cleric Fethullah&#160;Gulen. Emsal Koc and Koray Vural were kidnapped in the&#160;Tajik&#160;capital Dushanbe and taken to Turkey in the summer of 2023. Emsal Koc was the former head of the scientific and cultural organisation Dialogue in Dushanbe and Koray Vural was the director of one of the&#160;Tajik-Turkish&#160;lyceums in Dushanbe and had been engaged in business since the lyceum's closure.

Bakuteka also urged the Congolese government to provide resources to law enforcement and security forces to secure the country's borders.

He also called for humanitarian assistance for displaced people and urged both national and international communities to put pressure on armed groups to release kidnapped children.

It is unclear when LRA kidnapped the youths.

The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Anchor Shahzad Raza said the Supreme Court gave a ruling in the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (former president and prime minister) reference case on 6 March and stated that a fair trial was not held. He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the ruling and said redressal of the mistake is not possible, but admission of the mistake is a good move.&#160;","Raza said around 44 years ago, Bhutto was given a death sentence and his party [Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)] and the Bhutto family kept saying that it was a ""judicial murder"". He mentioned former president Asif Ali Zardari sent a presidential reference to the Supreme Court in 2008 for a review of the judgement. Raza said it is a welcome development that an institution has admitted its mistake.

Raza asked senior lawyer Yasin Azad why a decision on the reference took such a long time. Azad noted Asif Ali Zardari sent the reference when he was the president and the judgement has been given at a time when Zardari might again be made the president on 9 March. He said usually the trial of a murder case is conducted in a sessions court, but Bhutto's case was initiated directly in the Lahore High Court. He added out of the seven judges, three had declared that it was not a murder case and ordered Bhutto's acquittal, but four judges upheld the death sentence. He mentioned Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, a member of the bench hearing the case, later wrote in his book and also said in a TV interview that Bhutto's sentence was a judicial murder.

Azad claimed everyone in Pakistan said that Bhutto's sentence was against the law. He said he would give credit to the present-day Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, which took up the review case. He remarked in a short order, the Supreme Court as an institution, has admitted that requirements of justice were not fulfilled.

Azad said there are several other cases in which ""disputed judgements"" have been issued and they should be revisited by a full court. He complained the parliament ""does not play its due role in legislation"". He noted ever since Chief Justice Isa has taken over the office, the Supreme Court has ""recognised the supremacy of the parliament"", which is a welcome development. He said there are many ""difficulties"" in the Constitution which should be removed by the parliament.

PPP politician Syed Hasan Murtaza said it is good that such a verdict has been given which has ""helped in correcting the history"" and a family [referring to the Bhutto family] has finally been awarded justice after 44 years. He was of the view that it would have been better if a verdict had been issued which stated that it was a judicial murder and had also identified the murderers.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Raja Qamar ul Islam, noting that the correction came after 44 years, said it is ""better late than never"" and termed it a sign of ""judicial evolution"". He noted the PML-N and PPP remained hostile towards each other for several years but they also signed a ""charter of democracy"" and resolved to move forward after admitting their mistakes.

Speaking about the controversy around the recent election results and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) allegations that the results were manipulated, Azad said the PTI will have to prove its allegations before the election tribunals through evidence.

Commenting on the continuous protests by the PTI, Murtaza remarked such acts are damaging to the country and the democratic system. He urged Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) to stop the confrontation and maintain a ""working relationship"" in the parliament as political instability would further devastate the economy.

ONE PLUS ONE TV","DAY 1,283 OF RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE

Day of mourning in Kyiv

Kyiv is observing a day of mourning on 29 August after a Russian combined drone-and-missile strike killed 23 and injured over 60 civilians the previous day, the Ukrayinska Pravda news and analysis website reported.

As many as 225 residential buildings were damaged across the city, it added.

According to the pooled TV service, the search-and-rescue operation continues in Kyiv's Darnytskyy district with at least seven people believed to be missing.

""This strike clearly shows that Russia's goals have not changed. They want war - and they are striking not only our people, not only our cities and communities. Russia is now striking at everyone in the world who seeks peace. It is a strike against Ukraine. It is a strike against Europe. And it is also a strike by Russia against President Trump, and against other global actors,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address.

Zelensky noted that other Ukrainian cities are also suffering from Russia's deliberate strikes on civilian infrastructure and called on the international community to take ""strong steps"" to ""compel"" Russian leader Vladimir Putin to end the war.

""Russia kills every day. Therefore, every day they must feel the pain for what they are doing. And this is possible. The world's sanctions. Tariffs. Support for Ukraine. Our strong army. Our ability to defend lives and respond powerfully to the Russian war machine,"" Zelensky added.

Zelensky holds online talks with leaders of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Denmark

During a coordination online meeting with the leaders of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Denmark, Zelensky noted a ""negative signal"" from Russia regarding his possible talks with Putin.

""Honestly, we think Putin is still interested only in continuing this war. That's exactly why we need new strong pressure on Russia - tough sanctions, strong tariffs, both from Europe and from America,"" the Ukrainian president's official website quoted Zelensky as saying.

""Putin has not done what he said. It's time to move. We need a strong joint signal. And it would really help if that signal also came from you, dear friends,"" Zelensky said.

""And when we talk about security guarantees, we need clear answers - who will help us defend on the ground, in the air and at sea if Russia comes again. And how exactly you can take part - I'm asking you to define your role.""

Zelensky also took to X to thank Polish counterpart Karol Nawrocki for organising the virtual summit.

""Our strength is in our unity. And it is reassuring that our stance is unanimous: more pressure on Russia is needed to bring peace,"" Zelensky said in English.

Ukraine-Hungary row

President Zelensky condemned Hungary for banning Ukrainian Unmanned Systems Forces Commander Robert Brovdi (Magyar), an ethnic Hungarian, from entering Hungary and the Schengen zone.

""If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine's military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage,"" Zelensky said.

According to Zelensky, ""Hungarian officials have gone so far as to attempt to discriminate against members of the Hungarian community in Ukraine for their participation in the defence of our state and our people"".

""I have instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to clarify all the facts and respond accordingly,"" he added.

Earlier on 28 August, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on X that Brovdi had been banned due to Ukraine's strikes on Russia's Druzhba pipeline supplying oil to Hungary.

The Foreign Ministry summoned the Hungarian ambassador, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said.

""He was given a protest note in response to Hungary's discrimination against the Hungarian minority in Ukraine, particularly our Hungarian-descent defender who was banned from entering the country of his ancestors. We urge Hungary to further refrain from unfriendly actions and instead engage in constructive dialogue, for which Ukraine remains ready,"" Sybiha said on X in English.

Earlier Sybiha lambasted his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto for banning Brovdi, while Magyar himself took to Facebook to respond to the ban. In particular, he accused Szijjarto of being ""complicit in the multiplication of blood money"" by defending Russian oil supplies and told him to ""shove your sanctions and restrictions on visiting Hungary up your ass"".

The story took another twist after Polish Foreign Minister voiced support for Brovdi.

""While Russian missiles rain death on Kyiv, Hungary bans a brave ethnic Hungarian who dares to fight for Ukraine's freedom. Commander Magyar: if you need some R&R and Hungary won't let you in, please be our guest in Poland,"" Sikorski said on X in English.

""Endangering Hungary's energy security has nothing to do with the freedom of Ukraine!"" Szijjarto retorted.

Sybiha welcomed Sikorski's statement.

""Well said @sikorskiradek. Official Budapest, in its flirtation with the aggressor, has gone so far as to threaten and violate the rights of members of the Hungarian national minority. The reasons behind the blocking of Ukraine's path to the EU are now becoming blatantly obvious,"" he said on X in English.

""The scandal with Hungary's sanctions against Unmanned Systems Forces Commander Robert Brovdi (Magyar) has become a pan-European story. It showed the stance on Ukraine and its warriors defending their land,"" the reputable ZN.ua website said on Facebook.

Overnight attack

Ukraine's air defences shot down or suppressed 46 out of 68 Russian drones during an overnight attack on 28-29 August, the Air Force has reported on Facebook.

Shahed-type and decoy drones were neutralised over northern and eastern regions of the country.

The Air Force said that 22 strike drones hit targets across nine locations in Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

BBCSAP0020240308ek380012x,Pakistan's Samaa News TV show on controversies surrounding top court,"The following is a summary of the talk show ""Nadeem Malik Live"" hosted by anchor Nadeem Malik, a senior journalist and analyst, on moderate Samaa News TV in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 7 March 2024. The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Nadeem Malik said the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) found former Supreme Court judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi ""guilty of misconduct"". He termed it a ""very important decision"" because usually when a Supreme Court judge, against whom a complaint has been filed, resigns and goes home, the case against them is closed. He noted this is the first time that the SJC has drawn a line that the case would not be closed and would be taken to its ""logical conclusion"" even if the judge quits the office. He mentioned Naqvi had given a ""very controversial judgement"" about the court which gave a verdict in a high treason case. He cited several other cases which need to be reviewed by the SJC.","Malik said the Peshawar High Court has stopped the members nominated for reserved seats from taking oath till 13 March and noted the issue might end up going to the Supreme Court.

Malik asked Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Sardar Latif Khosa to comment on the SJC's verdict. Khosa said the verdict against Naqvi is ""unprecedented"" and an ""action in revenge"". He noted references against judges were never maintained after they resigned from the office. He alleged Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa had also committed ""misconduct"" when he refused to sit in the benches constituted by former chief justice Umar Ata Bandial on several cases. He added former judge Ijazul Ahsan also resigned because he ""could not get along with Chief Justice Isa"".

Malik asked Khosa whether he agrees that those who had sentenced Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (former president and prime minister) to death should be posthumously sentenced after a recent verdict of the Supreme Court which stated that Bhutto was not given a fair trial. Khosa replied he ""100 per cent agrees"" with Malik and cited an example of a ""posthumous trial"" of Cromwell in Britain. He remarked Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) is another prime minister who is a ""heartthrob of the people"" and is being targeted currently and demanded justice for him. He claimed people have reacted against political victimisation of the PTI by giving it a two-thirds majority.

Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) politician Palwasha Khan said other controversial cases should also be reviewed and noted many judgements of the judiciary have ""thrown Pakistan into turmoil"" and the nation is feeling their ""aftershocks"" even today. She insisted those responsible for such judgements should be held accountable.

Talking about the Bhutto case, Khan said it is not possible to say that justice has been done to Bhutto as he lost his life. She was of the view that the court should have named those who had issued that unfair judgement. She added even though those people are dead, ""handcuffs could have been placed over their graves"" as a symbolic punishment.

Khan said the PPP would not be affected even if the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) is given the reserved seats because the former has the required numbers to get Asif Ali Zardari (senior PPP politician) elected as the president on 9 March.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Abid Sher Ali said judges should also be held accountable because their verdicts affect lives of millions of people. He remarked Naqvi was a ""dishonest"" person and had ""strangulated justice"". He argued judges like Naqvi and Ijazul Ahsan sent an elected prime minister [Nawaz Sharif] home to serve their personal interests and ""violated the sanctity of the judiciary"".

Responding to Malik's question on whether reserved seats should be allotted to the SIC, Ali said if the SIC has submitted a list of candidates for reserved seats, it should be given those seats at any cost. However, he added, if it did not do so, the matter would be settled in the court. He commented the Supreme Court will not give its verdict on the basis of ""sympathy"", but according to the law and the Constitution.

Ali was of the view that those involved in the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of Imran Khan) of attacks on military installations and monuments of martyrs should ""never be spared"".

Editorial discusses politician's second tenure as president

""In a democratic system, the people are the first priority of the government and state, but we have witnessed that some undemocratic elements are also within the political parties. We have also witnessed some individuals who have presented great sacrifices for the people. In fact, in Pakistan, democracy is still weak&#8230; As a result of elections on 8 February, the politician of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Asif Ali Zardari, has taken oath as the 14th president of Pakistan. He was also elected president in 2008 and had proven to be a democratic president who strengthened the parliament by giving most of his powers to the parliament. He advised the parliament to carry out the 18th amendment to the Constitution to get rid of contamination from the Constitution included during dictatorial rules in the country. Now, he has become the president once again and we welcome him from our hearts. Zardari was a joint candidate of all the parties supporting this coalition federal government. He comprehensively defeated the opposition, Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) [elected members supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party joined the SIC after being elected as independent members] supported candidate Mahmood Khan Achakzai&#8230; In our view, Asif Ali Zardari was the most apt politician for this position. He has the ability and quality to take everyone along together. He is a very shrewd politician who knows how to convince others. He believes in democratic and reconciliatory politics. We welcome Asif Ali Zardari as president for these qualities and hope that the democratic system in the country will be strengthened. We also hope that he will convince the PTI to conduct national politics in a way that does not harm the country and this is the need of the hour."" [Page: 4, Approximate Words: 600]

BBCSAP0020240326ek3q000m9,"Pakistan's Samaa TV show on political confrontation, trial by military courts","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Nadeem Malik Live"" hosted by anchor Nadeem Malik, a senior journalist and analyst, on moderate Samaa News TV in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 25 March 2024. The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Nadeem Malik commented no political party or worker can defend the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PTI). He was of the view that the incidents were a result of a ""flawed political approach"" and took place after heightened ""polarisation"" that developed in the country. He remarked 9 May has rightly been termed a ""black day"".","Malik said political workers arrested for their involvement in the 9 May incidents can be divided into two categories: first, those who actively indulged in arson and vandalism and second, those who joined rallies and chanted slogans. He added the question is whether these people should face trials in military or civilian courts. He noted while hearing the case on 25 March, the Supreme Court questioned how many people accused in the 9 May incidents have been found innocent in the military courts, and the prosecution could not answer it. He argued military courts are ""not acceptable in a democratic country"", so civilian courts should be empowered to handle such cases.

Malik noted rumours of formation of a ""forward bloc"" of the PTI in the Punjab Assembly have been circulating lately. He said it is to be seen whether there is any truth in these reports.

Malik spoke with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Azma Bokhari whether everyone accused in the 9 May incidents should be awarded the same sentence or some distinction should be maintained. Bokhari said according to the criminal law, punishments should be awarded according to the actions of the accused. She claimed the PTI has been denying its involvement in the incidents despite evidence.

Bokhari said the PTI has neither condemned, nor disassociated itself from those involved in the attacks. She noted the PTI has nominated people like Murad Saeed who have been declared ""proclaimed offenders"" in the 9 May incidents for National Assembly (lower house of the parliament) and Senate (upper house of the parliament) elections. Replying to a question on which courts should people face trials in, she said it is very clear that if someone has intruded into an airbase or the Army's headquarters, ""they cannot be tried under the Land Revenue Act"" and trials in such cases are held under the Military Act.

Malik asked former Sindh governor Imran Ismail whether those involved in the 9 May incidents should face trial in military courts. Ismail said everyone, including members and leaders of the PTI, condemned the 9 May incidents. However, he added, it is the responsibility of government institutions to hold investigations and initiate trials. He expressed the view that it should be decided whether someone should be tried in a military or civilian court based on investigations.

Ismail said every government in Pakistan tries to get the support of the military and security institutions, while those in the opposition criticise these institutions. He emphasised politicians should stop seeking help from the military and perform their duties on their own. He condemned the 9 May incidents and agreed that it was a ""black day"".

Replying to a question on whether he would re-join the PTI, Ismail said he has not made a final decision in this regard. Responding to a question on how the current confrontation can be resolved, he said it is an ideal suggestion that all major parties should sit together and try to find a solution to the issues, but it is not happening because the government which should show flexibility seems to be ""bending backwards"" to oppose the PTI.

PTI politician Zain Qureshi said what happened on 9 May should not have happened, but whether the PTI had any role in it is to be determined by the courts. He termed the 9 May incidents a ""false flag operation"" and claimed thousands of PTI workers have been put in jail without any evidence. He emphasised the legal system should not be ""politicised"" or ""weaponised"". Commenting on reports about a forward bloc in the PTI, he said all PTI members are loyal to the party and there is no truth in these rumours.

BBCSAP0020240304ek340018h,Experts highlight significance of India's new naval base in Lakshadweep,"By BBC Monitoring

India's English-language news channel NewsX has held a discussion on the importance of the development of a naval base on Minicoy Island in federally-ruled territory Lakshadweep.","The news anchor, Devika Chopra, noted that the base, named INS Jatayu, will boost the navy's operations against piracy and narcotics in the Arabian Sea. It will also strengthen the navy's surveillance capabilities, she said during the programme aired on 3 March.

NewsX is an English-language channel supportive of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Defence expert UK Devnath, interviewed on the show, noted the geographical proximity of Minicoy Island to the Maldives. He said that deployment of ships and aircraft close to it will ""go a long way in ensuring our ability to keep a surveillance on mischievous activities&#8221; by navies, especially the Chinese navy.

He also pointed out that the base would help all Indian ships operating in the Arabian Sea replenish logistical items including consumables.

Another analyst Robinder Sachdev noted that the development of the base coincides with India&#8217;s growing geopolitical importance and the base would help the country protect its sovereignty.

He added that considering Minicoy Island&#8217;s strategic location, it will help India project its naval abilities. He highlighted that India will also be able to monitor Chinese ""maritime expansionism"" in the Indian Ocean as well as ""play a bigger role"" in the region.

According to another analyst AK Siwach, the new base will help India economically as well as militarily.&#160;

India has realised the importance of gaining influence in the Arabian Sea and the development of the Jatayu base would have ""tremendous impact"" on India&#8217;s efforts in countering Chinese influence in the Maldives as well as in the Indian Ocean, Siwach said.

The editorial said: ""Along with the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir, in which the state was divided into two parts, the new demarcation of legislative assembly and local body constituencies is disrupting the electoral fabric of Kashmir and Jammu. The division is still acceptable to people to some extent, but the way the division is now being brought forward along the political, regional, religious, sectarian and caste-based lines, only a few people will benefit from it. No political party cares about this loss and division. On the contrary, every political party sees this division as the means of fulfilling their political interests. The division will prove to be a killer of the unity, integrity, public brotherhood, and communal amity between Kashmir and Jammu.

BBCSAP0020240330ek3u0002t,TV talk show discusses foreign forces' alleged war crimes in Afghanistan,"By BBC Monitoring

Afghan commentators appearing on the private Ariana News TV's Tahawol (Change) debate programme on 27 March discussed the allegations levelled by UK's Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Johnny Mercer, that members of Britain's SAS (Special Air Service) were engaged in ""war crimes"" during their mission in Afghanistan.&#160;","A report by the Guardian newspaper said that the chair of the UK's Afghanistan inquiry had ordered Mercer to reveal the source of his allegations against the British soldiers. The minister had been given a ten-day ultimatum to do so or face a potential prison sentence.

Speaking on the programme online, Norway-based political commentator Rahmat Ullah Bezhanpour said: ""At that time [refers to US-led forces' invasion of Afghanistan in 2001], a large contingent of troops from the West were deployed in Afghanistan and around 60,000 military personnel started their operations there under the pretext of combatting terrorism.""

""At that time, two countries, namely the US in the lead and the UK as the second nation after the US, played the key role with regard to the hidden and obvious agedna concerning Afghanistan,"" he added.

Bezhanpour accused the West of not investigating the allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan, and seeking to exaggerating such investigations to achieve other goals.&#160;

""It means that the West has always tried to exaggerate the issue, instead of genuinely investigating the crimes. They had gone there [Afghanistan] to commit crimes. The soliders [deployed there] were told that people would be killed, and they [the soldiers] would &#160;[also] be killed there. Whatever happened had been pledged and agreed,"" he said.&#160;

""In the beginning of the assignment [the invasion of Afghanistan], killing [people] was not a crime from their perspective. The reason that they [the West] are now talking of holding judicial trials [to investigate war crimes] is their internal divergences,"" he added.

Bezhanpour stated that the West, especially the US and the UK, are gearing up to return to Afghanistan.&#160;

""In fact, American and the British officials are in consultation with Europeans about [their possible] return to Afghanistan. However, the Europeans argued that they had gone to Afghanistan some years ago, but failed to achieve what they had aimed for,"" said Bezhanpour.

Political commentator Aziz Stanikzai who joined the debate from Kabul, via video link, said: ""You know better that the West and the US, in the lead, entered Afghanistan 22 years ago to launch a vague campaign against extremists or those who had targeted the US towers. That time, it was heard and noticed that it were Arabs who had masterminded and implemented it [ti 9/11 attacks].""

Describing the UK inquiry into the war crimes allegation as ""a propaganda"", Stanikzai said: ""Anyway, it is a propaganda.""

""Crimes had been committed in Afghanistan. Not only the British, but Germans had also martyred 97 children and injured hundreds of others in Kunduz Province. Nobody has so far been put on trial. Nobody has been held accountable for it,"" he added.&#160;

Meanwhile, political pundit Sami Ullah Ahmadzai accused Americans of committing war crimes in Afghanistan during their 20-year-long military presence.

""Under the pretext of fighting terrorism, they had invaded Afghanistan. They stayed in Afghanistan for 20 years and committed crimes which were not confined to only one to two individuals. Americans, claiming to fight terrorism, came to Afghanistan primarily to achieve their own goals,"" he said.

""One of the tactics Americans used at the Bonn Conference was to establish the Afghan National Army, police and security forces. Americans at the Bonn Conference established the three organisations to reduce its casualties in the battlefield,"" claimed Ahmadzai .&#160;

Concluding, he said that such inquiries cannot hold accountable the leaders who had ordered deployment of forces to Afghanistan, which resulted in the perpetration of the ""crimes"".

Panellists included economist Jabbar Memon, and senior journalists Qurban Baloch and Khaleeq Kiani.

Memon said, ""The finance minister has been appointed and it seems that he is well aware of the economic situation. There is no doubt that he is a banker and a very successful one. It has yet to be seen whether he can be an economist or not. This portfolio will be good for his CV. If he overcomes the crises of economy and climate change, then he will be successful. He has said that Pakistan will seek a long-term and extended programme. Everyone knows that we need to expand our tax base so that we can increase our revenue collection. We have to bring about reforms to our tax system and real estate, retail and agriculture sectors have to pay taxes. We need to build the trust of the people in the government.

Kiani said, ""Zafar Mahmood is the former chairman of WAPDA and this appointment seems to be a violation of the IRSA Act, which was prepared by all the four provinces. This appointment will annoy the provinces. The IRSA chairman has to be a member of IRSA from the province or the federation. I think all four provinces will have reservations on this appointment. This appointment has to be reversed. President Zardari will have to play his leadership role. Now, IRSA will be under the Ministry of Water Resources.

Baloch said, ""This is an issue of giving IRSA total control of the federal government. No notification of this appointment has been issued by the establishment division. This is a violation of the IRSA Act, which says that the chairman can only be from among the members of IRSA. The Sindh Minister of Irrigation, Jam Khan Shoro, has also condemned this appointment. It seems that the autonomy of IRSA is no more and it has come under the federal government. I think that the provinces should approach the Council of Common Interests (CCI). This amendment to the IRSA Act, which allows a chairman from outside IRSA members, was done during the caretaker government.""

Discussion on economy

Anchor Najia Mir said that after the federal government, provincial cabinets have also been formed. Some new faces have been introduced, she said. Will this be able to end the political and economic crises, Mir asked. Panellists included former diplomat GR Baloch, economist Asad Ali Shah and analyst Professor Abdul Majeed Chandio.&#160;

Shah said, ""Aurangzeb is the new finance minister and is a clear-headed banker. Whatever we earn through taxes goes into debt retirement and we take more loans to run the country. Our economy is still in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The standby agreement is ending in March and we will get the last [IMF] tranche. We need continuous support from the IMF. Unfortunately, no political party had provided an economic programme in its election manifesto. We have to see how the new finance minister tackles the economic challenges. Our politics is very polarised. I do not see any disruption to economic activity because of political disputes. The next two to three years will be very difficult for our economy. We need to get an extended programme from the IMF worth $7-8bn. With this, we have to bring reforms to our economy.""

Baloch said, ""Our economic structure has holes in it and there are dozens of government enterprises in loss. This is bleeding our economy. I think that the only solution is the privatising of these loss-making enterprises. The power [electricity] theft is also alarming. There should be an economic advisory board that should look into the economic quagmire. The members should be independent economists and not government servants. We have to stop the bleeding of our economy. Tax evasion is also a huge problem. Only technical experts can take tough decisions. Our economy has to stand on its own feet and for this we have to be on a treatment table for a long time. The foreign policy of every country reflects its internal strength, both political and economic. The political parties should have a grand dialogue on stabilising our economy and politics.""

Chandio said, ""The finance minister said that he will reduce the interest rate. The IMF wants to increase the tax base. We also need to increase our exports. We can export cotton and other agricultural products. The economy will not improve if we ourselves do not think of out-of-the-box solutions. The PPP wants a public-private partnership whereas I think that the only solution is complete privatisation. The PTI is trying to de-stabilise our economy by writing to the IMF and European Union (EU) not to help Pakistan. It is so unfortunate that no political party has an economic team. The grand political dialogue should also include regional political parties. We need to address our governance as well.""

BBCSAP0020240312ek3c0005l,Pakistan's PTV show on newly appointed cabinet of ministers,"The following is a summary of the talk show ""Riasat"" (The State), hosted by anchor Shahzad Raza on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 11 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Anchor Shahzad Raza said newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari administered oath to a 19-member federal cabinet on 11 March. He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has included ""very seasoned people"" in his cabinet but portfolios of the ministers have not yet been announced.","Raza asked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Qaiser Ahmed Shaikh whether he would be assigned a ministry related to business and economy. Shaikh agreed and remarked one can perform only if he is assigned a task in which he has a background and experience. He noted ""business confidence"" in Pakistan is at the lowest ebb and the main task before the government at the moment is to fix the economy. He mentioned the prime minister spoke in detail about the economic issues and expressed the resolve that his government's full-fledged attention would be on the economy.

Raza asked Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) politician Nadir Gabol whether his party would join the cabinet at a later stage. Gabol replied Bilawal Bhutto Zardari (PPP chairperson) has repeatedly stated that his party would not join the cabinet but would support Shehbaz Sharif's government on an ""issue to issue basis"". He said the objective of it is to give Sharif a chance to focus on governance and select a cabinet of his choice. He added the PPP wants that relief should be provided to the people and the issue of terrorism should also be addressed.

Gabol said the PPP might review its decision about joining the cabinet after a few years if the situation improves. He explained his party does not want to join the cabinet because its ideology is very different from that of the PML-N as the former is a ""progressive centre-left party"".

Raza asked analyst Sana Mirza whether political stability is expected since Asif Ali Zardari from the PPP has been elected as the president and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has also joined the parliament. Mirza replied, ""If we think that the PTI will sit quietly because it is now in the parliament, it is wrong"". She noted after elections, the PTI claimed that its right has been taken away as other parties have formed a government.

Mirza claimed the PTI will not let the parliament work if its demands are not addressed. She noted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has demanded that a commission should be formed to look into the election results and the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of the then-chairperson Imran Khan) but it would be a lengthy process. She further noted PTI politician Asad Qaiser claimed if a ""certain personality [referring to former chief minister of Punjab Mohsin Naqvi]"" is appointed as the interior minister, ""doors of talks would be closed permanently"". She said the PTI has alleged that Naqvi played an important role in the rigging of elections in Punjab.

Mirza said the people included in the cabinet are those who can work with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. She claimed the [military] establishment also had some influence in the selection of the cabinet. She was of the view that a ""technocrat government"" is needed at the moment to solve the economic problems of the country.

Shaikh noted the allegations of election rigging have been levelled by the PTI in every election. He appreciated the PPP's decision to support the PML-N government and said by not joining the cabinet, PPP has allowed the PML-N to form its government and adopt its manifesto. He termed it a ""favour by the PPP"" and expressed hope in the two parties working in coordination with each other.

Shaikh said Prime Minister Sharif is ""dedicated"" and ""determined"" to solve the economic problems, increasing exports, and promoting industries. He remarked the government's direction will become clear in the next few months. He was of the view that the PTI would not continue its protests for a very long time because that would make it unpopular among its voters. He opined the government would decrease the interest rate gradually because an interest rate over 10 to 12 per cent would be unfavourable for business development.

Gabol said President Zardari would not have executive powers but he would play a different role. He recalled during his previous tenure, Zardari had contributed significantly to economic matters.

Shaikh disagreed with the view that the government would not be stable and insisted Pakistan is at a ""make or break stage"". He said the country cannot continue taking more loans, so all stakeholders will have to sit together. He was of the view that ""drastic changes"" would be brought by the new government regarding allocation of funds to different areas. He also mentioned election reforms would be discussed in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament).

Mirza said the team chosen by Prime Minister Sharif includes people who have proven themselves as good administrators. She was of the view that Sharif is the ""ultimate choice for prime ministership"" at the time when Pakistan is facing many issues and he should try to perform with a ""limited team"".

An editorial in English-language Pakistani newspaper Daily Times has underscored Pakistan's ""growing vulnerability to climate change"".","Daily Times is a moderate newspaper, which is generally critical of jihadist groups.

""Recent deaths in some parts of Balochistan and India-held Kashmir [Indian-administered Kashmir] due to heavy rains and landslides serve as a stark reminder to the new government in the wake of Pakistan's growing vulnerability to climate change,"" said the editorial on 11 March.

""While major cities like Karachi and other urban areas remained safe from untimely rains, heavy rains and unseasonal snowfall in Balochistan and northern areas showcase a concerning picture, and perhaps warn the people about upcoming times,"" it warned.

""Memories of last year's floods, which impacted over 30 million people, are still fresh. Pakistan, already categorised as one of the countries most susceptible to climate change, faces a heightened threat. The time for complacency is over,"" it emphasised.&#160;

Listing possible actions, the editorial said that ""firstly, institutions responsible for disaster management, including disaster management authorities and irrigation departments, must begin immediate preparedness efforts.""

""Secondly, raising public awareness is crucial. Educating the public on flood safety measures, early warning systems, and evacuation procedures will empower them to respond effectively in case of emergencies. Thirdly, long-term climate change mitigation strategies cannot be ignored,"" it added.

""Fourthly, international cooperation is paramount. The government must actively participate in global climate change dialogues and seek assistance in mitigation efforts and adaptation strategies,"" it further said.

Reiterating the call for action, the paper said that ""it is time to act. We can choose to ignore the warning signs and face the consequences, or we can act collectively, embracing proactive solutions.""&#160;

Minister of Fisheries and Ocean Resources Ahmed Shiyam on 7 March, at a press conference held to share progress on the government's 100-day pledges for the sector, said the government's objective is to reduce the export of raw fish from the country to zero.

Pakistan and Afghanistan relations have soured due to this issue, Memon said. The opposition wants to start a campaign against rigging in the elections. Security and the economy are inter-connected, she added. Panellists included Islamabad bureau chief of Sindh TV News, Shakir Solangi, and senior analyst Shaheen Qureshi.&#160;

Solangi said, ""The law and order situation in KP is deteriorating by the day. During the election campaign, Maulana Fazlur Rehman [head of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, or JUI] had said that he could not campaign in KP's Dera Ismail Khan due to terror threats. The Afghan authorities are not cooperating with Pakistan. Just yesterday, Chinese nationals were attacked. Several arrested terrorists are from Afghanistan. Today, the prime minister chaired a meeting with regard to security and decided to continue the fight against terrorists. The investor will not come to Pakistan in this situation. There is no terrorism in Sindh but there is a law and order situation, in which dacoits are openly threatening the Sindhi society. The traders in Sindh are worried and cannot run their businesses peacefully. Similar is the situation in Balochistan. There is peace in Punjab province only. The PPP had restored peace in Swat during 2008-13 government. The PTI and the PML-N have a soft corner for the terrorists. The TTP has the weapons left by the United States in Afghanistan. The Afghan government is unmoved on Pakistani concerns about these terrorists. Maulana Rehman has announced that he will start his campaign from 25 April, protesting against rigging in the general elections. The PTI always hold violent protests, whereas Maulana Rehman's protests have always been peaceful. Hence, it is not possible that these parties will protest jointly.""

Qureshi said, ""Pakistan is being attacked at a time when it is facing its worst economic situation. The terrorists are targeting Chinese nationals. China is helping Pakistan to stabilise its economy. Pakistan needs political and economic stability. This attack is very serious. We need to be aware the we are a target for our enemies. We are under a lot of debt. Today we are living in a hybrid system. The parliament seems to have lost its importance and credibility. Our interior minister is also heading the cricket board. It seems to have a very unserious attitude. Only parliament can unite the nation. The PTI had released terrorists during its tenure in government and wanted to bring those terrorists in to the main stream politics. The situation today is the result of confusion about the policy about these terrorists. The National Action Plan is in cold storage now. The situation is very alarming.

Anchor Najia Mir said that the six judges of the IHC have written a letter to the judicial commission. A petition against these six judges has also been filed, she said. The PTI, in a strong reaction, has demanded to declare all the sentences against Imran Khan as null and void, Mir said. The Supreme Court has held a full court meeting in this regard. The security situation in the country is also very serious, she said. The killing of Chinese nationals is another serious matter, she added. Panellists included Dr Karim Khawaja of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), former diplomat Alam Brohi, analyst Aijaz Qureshi and journalist Aijaz Mehar.&#160;

Khawaja said, ""Five years ago, another judge, Shaukat Siddiqui, had also accused security personnel of interference in judiciary. This is a continuation of the same. Pakistan has a history of judicial crises. The judiciary itself is to blame for being weak. It is hoped that the full court will decide in the interests of the country. [The killing of Chinese nationals] is a condemnable act. This is to fail the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Whatever happens in Pakistan will destabilise the whole region. It is being said that in the next 20 years, China will be the superpower of the world.""

Brohi said, ""The attacks on Chinese nationals have taken place several times. We are continuously confronting security issues. We need to have a consensus on security issues. This situation is for the last two decades. The purpose of targeting Chinese nationals is to stop foreign investments in Pakistan. The question arises whether we hold such talks in the media after every incident and then forget the issue. Recently attacks were also conducted in Gwadar and Turbat in Balochistan. It is a golden opportunity for all stakeholders to decide on the judicial matters once for all and correct all its past mistakes. The establishment has been interfering in politics and the judiciary for a long time.""

Mehar said, ""The CPEC was a game-changer programme for Pakistan. India is not happy with it and the United States also has reservations. There are several foreign elements that do not like this project. Freelance jihadis may have conducted this attack. If security agencies interfere in political issues, then these attacks may happen. The timing of the letter is very important. This is the time when Imran Khan's cases are being heard in the courts. The former chief justice [Umar Ata] Bandial did not take up Justice Siddiqui's case. The situation in the judiciary is very unfortunate. Now we have to see what the full court decides in this case. Let's wait for the full court's decision. Parliament should also discuss the issue in detail. In the past, the judiciary has been undermining the parliament.""

Qureshi said, ""The timing of this letter is very important. Pakistani judicial history tells us that such interference started at the beginning of inception of this country. The judiciary introduced a doctrine of necessity and that started all this interference. We had several judges in the past who were supported by the military establishment. I agree that parliament should play its role. We are in a very difficult situation. Chinese are being killed because China is helping Pakistan. This is a very important juncture in our history. Terrorism is destabilising the country.""

BBCSAP0020240318ek3i0005l,"Pakistan's PTV show on militant attack on soldiers, political developments","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Siyasi Ahwal"" (Political Situation) hosted by anchor Shahzada Zulfiqar on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 17 March 2024. The programme invites experts and politicians to express their opinions and analysis on important news of the day.

Anchor Shahzada Zulfiqar said a ""shocking incident of terrorism"" took place on 16 March in the Mir Ali area of South Waziristan in which seven Army personnel, including two officers, who were fighting ""terrorists"" were martyred. He mentioned Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar expressed distress over an alleged social media campaign ridiculing the martyrs.","Zulfiqar spoke with former caretaker minister Zubair Jamali and asked him to comment on the recent incident of the martyrdom of military officers. Jamali said it is a very gloomy event for a family to receive the dead body of their young son. He noted a lieutenant colonel, captain and five soldiers have been martyred, and they have sacrificed their lives for the country. He remarked such incidents prove to be a ""binding force"" for the country and people need to realise that if they are living safely in their villages and cities, it is ""at the cost of soldiers who are fighting against terrorism on borders and within the country"". He added people should be thankful to the martyrs and their families for their sacrifice.

Senior journalist Saleem Shahid said it was a very sad incident, but it should be noted that the officers and soldiers fought against ""terrorists"" and killed six of them before embracing martyrdom.&#160;He noted incidents of terrorism have increased recently. He was of the view that such incidents cannot be planned and executed by a small group and large-scale resources are behind them which are only available to a state. He claimed due to this, some state is behind these incidents and is funding such elements.

Zulfiqar noted President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over martyrdom of the military personnel and expressed a firm resolve that ""revenge"" would be taken for the killing. He asked Mir Saadat Baloch, pro-vice chancellor of the Panjgur University, to comment on the same. Baloch paid tributes to the martyred soldiers and said Zardari's reaction to the incident is ""understandable"" because his family has also been a victim (his wife and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in an attack).

Commenting on the alleged social media campaign ridiculing the martyrs, Jamali insisted elements involved in ""insulting propaganda"" should be ""gripped with a hard fist"". He said the martyrs have offered the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their lives, so the government and civil society should ""thrash"" such elements.

Shahid said the propaganda insulting martyrs is ""highly deplorable"" and such comments are very painful for their families. He added people should realise that ""their existence is linked to the existence of the country"" and being ""country-less"" is a huge tragedy. He insisted the government should take serious action against such people.

Baloch condemned those targeting martyrs with malicious campaigns and said a ""strategy"" should be devised, not only against those who are active on social media, but also against those who are encouraging them. He recalled a foreign institution had conducted a survey before elections to assess whether people's confidence in the military had declined. He noted according to the results of the survey, ""89 per cent of the youth all over Pakistan expressed confidence in the military"". He agreed that action must be taken against those involved in propaganda.

Commenting on a recent meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Jamali said it is a ""positive gesture"" as everyone needs to work jointly for the country. Shahid commented coordination among different institutions is necessary for improving the economy. He noted the caretaker government took important steps to solve economic issues which should be taken forward by the new government. He said opposition parties should not create hurdles in the working of the new government. Baloch remarked people need to rise above party politics in the larger interest of the country.

Zulfiqar said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met a young student from Balochistan on 17 March. He noted Sharif had met the student in 2022 while visiting flood-hit areas and had helped the youth enrol in a reputable college. Jamali appreciated the prime minister's action and urged him to establish a network of quality schools in Balochistan, like he did in Punjab under his government. Baloch remarked it is a ""welcome message"" from the prime minister which would encourage students to focus more on their education.

BBCSAP0020240315ek3f000b5,"Pakistan's PTV show on political developments, empowerment of local governments","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Riasat"" (The State), hosted by anchor Shahzad Raza on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 14 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day

Anchor Shahzad Raza said a meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took place on 13 March. He noted the meeting was cordial and Gandapur, who is known as a ""hard-hitting batsman"" of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), maintained a political tone in the media talk after the meeting. He remarked it is good that people sitting in the opposition seem to be convinced that they should remain a part of the parliamentary system.","Raza spoke with Asiya Ishaq, a member of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), and asked her whether she is optimistic about the PTI remaining in the parliament this time and playing the role of the opposition despite reservations. Ishaq replied it is good to see that the PTI has passed through an ""evolutionary process"". Recalling that earlier the PTI had resigned from the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament) and had suffered setbacks due to wrong decisions, she expressed hope about the party learning from its past mistakes. She commented the party again ""committed a blunder"" when it decided to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and could not get a share in the reserved seats for women due to it.

Raza spoke with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Ramesh Singh Arora and asked him how far has Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz's style of politics changed after becoming the chief minister as she was an ""aggressive politician"" earlier. Arora replied there is a ""background"" for Nawaz's aggressive politics as she and her entire family had to face persecution for several years ""from [former president] General Pervez Musharraf's government to [former prime minister] Imran Khan's civilian martial law"". He said through her aggressive politics, Nawaz emerged as the top crowd-puller politician of the country. He added Nawaz now stands for ""performance, delivery, reconciliation and corruption-free Punjab"". He noted in her first speech as the chief minister, Nawaz said she would serve the people of Punjab. He mentioned after being elected as the chief minister, she went to the opposition leader to say that she is not only the chief minister of her government, but also the opposition.

Raza asked senior journalist Saleh Zaafir how President Asif Ali Zardari would leverage his political weight during the next five years. Zaafir said as the president, Zardari has no administrative powers but being a senior politician from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which has its government in Sindh and a coalition government in Balochistan, is his ""strength"".

Raza asked Ishaq about her party's demand that local governments should be empowered. Ishaq said for the MQM, empowerment of local governments is very important, and it had a ""one-point agenda"" during talks for an alliance with the PML-N before elections that three amendments should be brought into the Constitution for this purpose. She added these amendments would be beneficial for the entire Pakistan. She mentioned the MQM has demanded that the office of the mayor should be mentioned in the Constitution like offices of chief ministers and the prime minister, the federal government should transfer funds directly to districts, and elections for the National Assembly and provincial assemblies should not be held before local government elections.

Raza asked Arora whether his party supports empowerment of local governments. Arora replied the PML-N has been a victim regarding local governments as the previous PTI government had sent all the elected local government members in Punjab home immediately after coming into power. He supported the MQM's demands and said all political parties should work jointly for such issues. He further said he is not clear about the party line on direct funding to district governments from the federal government, but in his ""personal opinion"", provinces should distribute funds to the districts.

Zaafir claimed political governments in Pakistan have always felt threatened by local governments. He was of the view that it would be better if funds to districts are distributed by the provinces.

BBCSAP0020240320ek3k001rx,"Pakistan's Dunya TV show on politics, crime rate in Sindh, gas prices","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Dunya Kamran Khan Kay Saath"" (World With Kamran Khan), hosted by senior journalist and TV host Kamran Khan on moderate Dunya News TV in Urdu at 16:30 GMT on 19 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Politics of PML-N","Anchor Kamran Khan said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has emerged with a ""new identity"" as its narrative of resistance and accountability has transformed into ""compromise with reality"". He noted it is in this situation that Nawaz Sharif (senior PML-N politician) has awarded party tickets to several non-PML-N candidates for the Senate (upper house of the parliament) elections and they would contest as independent candidates.

Khan mentioned Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi, Minister of Establishment Ahad Cheema and technocrat Mustafa Ramday would be elected by the PML-N's votes in Punjab. He questioned whether it is a mere coincidence that the party did not choose its long-time loyalists like Rana Sanaullah, Khawaja Saad Rafiq, and Khurram Dastgir for the Senate elections. He commented it looks like the PML-N has ""actually put its politics at stake"" to save the state.

Khan spoke with political commentator Kamran Shahid and asked him to share his views on the PML-N's claim that is has sacrificed its politics, political narrative and political identity to save the state. Shahid disagreed with the claim and said the PML-N's politics has been destroyed by results of the recent elections as it was ""voted out"" after the polls. He expressed the view that the PML-N has probably realised that it does not have the strength of vote and can get the prime ministership ""only through a collaboration with the [military] establishment"".

Shahid noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has been formed in coalition with several parties because it did not have enough votes in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament). He called it ""power politics"" and said it was not an attempt to save the state. He remarked the 8 February elections have shown that politics and power are not with the PML-N at the moment.

Crime rate in Sindh

Khan said the law and order situation in Sindh is ""out of control"". He added this is the situation when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has completed 15 years in government in the province and has still not been able to end street crime and abductions there. He noted street criminals in Karachi (capital of Sindh) take life of one citizen every second day and nine citizens are looted every hour.

Khan asked Dunya News bureau chief Talha Hashmi about reports regarding crime in Sindh and the Sindh government's reaction. Hashmi said it was decided that an operation would be launched with the help of paramilitary forces against dacoits in the riverine area, but it is yet to be implemented. Talking about the law and order situation in Karachi, he mentioned most people who have been killed were young and some were students, so it looks like a kind of ""genocide of the youth of Karachi"". He noted only 10 per cent of the crimes get reported which means the number of crimes committed every day is much higher.

Khan spoke with Karachi's Inspector General of Police Khadim Hussain Rind and asked him why street crime is increasing in the area. Rind agreed that there has been a surge in the crime rate in January and February. He noted the crime rate has been increasing every year but claimed it has been controlled to some extent in March. He further claimed Karachi was the 11th most dangerous city in the world in 2013 and its ranking is below 100 in 2024. He added 688 police officers have lost their lives in the last few years.

Gas prices

Khan said gas prices would further increase and noted gas tariff has increased by 260 per cent in the last four months. He noted gas companies have proposed an increase of 147 per cent for domestic consumers.

Khan spoke with Tahir Abbas, an expert on energy affairs, and asked him about the reason behind the proposed increase. Abbas said the proposal includes an increase to meet the arrears. He was of the view that the government would approve a much lower increase. He mentioned gas is being used by captive power plants to generate electricity in industries but these plants are ""very inefficient"". He suggested this gas could be diverted to efficient power plants which could help reduce the cost of electricity.

The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Performance of chief ministers","Anchor Kamran Khan said newly formed governments in Punjab and Sindh have completed the first month after their formation and noted that Maryam Nawaz has taken over the chief ministership of Punjab for the first time, while Murad Ali Shah has become the chief minister of Sindh for the third time and has been working in the province since the last eight years. However, he added, there is a huge difference between the performance of these two governments.

Khan said on one hand, Nawaz has been very active in the province and has announced several new projects but on the other, Shah has remained ""absent from the scene"" throughout the month. He noted Nawaz has been visiting public places and trying to solve the issues of the people.

Khan played a video report on Nawaz and Shah's activities during the past month. The report noted Nawaz has announced low-cost houses for people with low income, e-bikes and urban bus projects for the youth, and has decided to provide ration to the poor during Ramadan (month of fasting for Muslims). The report further said Nawaz has been overseeing all these projects and calling meetings on dozens of issues. It added she announced ""safe city projects"" for 18 cities of Punjab would be completed in the next three months and has launched an overseas property transfer service for the Pakistanis living abroad.

The report noted Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah visited south Karachi once in the last one month and inspected the condition of the rainwater drainage system there. It said apart from this, Shah was not seen in any public place. It further said meeting of the cabinet was held only once but an agreement for the Karachi safe city project was approved after a long wait of 16 years.

Scandal surrounding new federal minister

Khan said in the initial weeks of the new government in the centre, a scandal has surfaced which has created upheaval in the highly reputed Aitchison College of Lahore. He mentioned Punjab Governor Baligh ur Rehman, who is the chairperson of the board of governors of the college, ordered waiver of college fees and fine for two sons of the newly appointed federal minister Ahad Cheema. He added due to this, college principal Michael A Thomson resigned from his post. He noted in a letter, Thomson wrote that he would leave on 1 April and not play any role in management of the upcoming admissions.

Khan mentioned after the principal's resignation, Syed Babar Ali (senior member of the college's board of governors) also resigned in protest over political interference in the affairs of the college.

Tax reforms

Khan said a ""historic step"" is about to be taken by bringing the retail sector under the tax net as well as all other sectors which are currently not under the tax net. He mentioned traders in major cities would be registered through the Tajir Dost (trader-friendly) scheme. He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently claimed 14,000bn rupees ($50bn) can be collected in taxes if the tax net is expanded to all the sectors.

Khan spoke with Zeeshan Merchant, an expert on tax affairs, and asked him whether the new scheme is implementable. Merchant said the focus these days is on ""digitisation"" and several changes are being made for this purpose. He added the question is whether any discussion was held with the traders for whom this scheme has been announced. He recalled similar schemes in past had failed and enforcement is the biggest issue due to which tax revenue has not increased in the past years. He was of the view that the scheme should be discussed with the stakeholders before its implementation and suggested that the system should be simplified as much as possible.

Crime rate in Sindh

Khan said the crime rate has ""hugely increased"" in the interior Sindh due to which freight containers cannot pass through the highways in the province and everything that needs to be transported upcountry remains stuck in Karachi. He added robbers loot trucks, freight containers and oil tankers on the main highways connecting Sindh and Punjab. He noted cases of shooting, robberies and kidnapping of transporters for ransom have increased in the last few months. He insisted a decisive operation against dacoits is necessary in this situation and it should be launched jointly by the Sindh and Punjab police.

A political commentator interviewed in the report accused the West of seeking to undermine its adversaries by supporting terrorist groups.

Speaking to the channel via video call, Kabul-based political commentator Salim Paigir said: ""There is no doubt that [terrorist] groups have been emboldened, but such extent is unbelievable. The groups that carry out explosions and suicide attacks in Tehran and Moscow have been established major countries, and they use them for their interests.""

""Hence, neither the people of Afghanistan nor any other group here can be blamed, other than the major countries that use the name of Islam and Islamic groups for their interests,"" he added.

'Miscommunication' behind India boarding Maldivian vessels

Minister of Defence Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon on 25 March said India has officially informed the Maldives that its navy officers had boarded three Maldivian fishing vessels in Maldivian waters due to a ""miscommunication"". Responding to questions from lawmakers in parliament, the minister said India has also informed the Maldives that its navy had boarded the vessels because they had had satellite phones and that they had believed it was illegal. The minister said while the use of satellite phones in Indian waters was banned after an amendment to certain Indian regulations, it was mandatory under Maldivian regulations to have one, especially if the vessels venture outside a certain distance. Responding to a question by Member of Parliament for Hulhumale, Ali Niyaz, on whether the minister believed in the response, the minister said he believed it had been a miscommunication, and that the Maldivian Chief of Defence Force, who had been in India on an official visit at the time, had also been informed by senior policy-level Indian officials of the same. The minister, however, said there are various established channels between neighbouring countries to provide information to each other when such operations are undertaken on the seas, but that it was surprising that no information had been shared on the operation undertaken where the Indian Navy had boarded the Maldivian vessels. The minister also confirmed that the Maldivian vessels had been inside Maldivian waters prior to and when the operation was conducted and had not ventured into Indian waters. He added that future measures will include increased coordination between all countries and establish a mechanism to work together, as well as increase the capability within the Maldives to monitor its own borders, which the government has already started.

An article in The Express Tribune paper has urged authorities to seek China&#8217;s help to develop the renewable energy sector.","""Given Pakistan&#8217;s close economic relations with China and given the attention that Beijing has begun to give to developing new sources of energy, Pakistan could turn to Beijing for help for developing some of these resources,"" the article said on 18 March.

It added Pakistan could make the renewable sources of energy an ""important component"" of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) programme.

It urged authorities to focus on renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, adding different governments had ""paid little attention"" to the sector.

It noted most of Pakistan&#8217;s investments in energy were used to build coal-fired plants, including those brought to Pakistan from China.

The article highlighted a Chinese government pledge to accelerate the construction of solar panel farms as well as wind and hydroelectric projects.&#160;

""This emphasis on renewables is part of Beijing&#8217;s effort to reignite its faltering economy. China&#8217;s leadership says that it has decided to focus on a 'new trio' of industries - solar panels, electric cars and lithium batteries - replacing the old trio of clothing, furniture and electric appliances,"" it added.

Such efforts have made Beijing a major supplier to the world of electric cars and solar panels, it said.

Pakistan&#8217;s demand for electric power far exceeds the amount it produces at present, the article said, noting fossil fuels account for 59% of total production.

It added Pakistan could build solar farms in the deserts of Sindh and Balochistan as China did in Xinjiang, which is mostly made up of deserts and mountains.

Nida-I-Mashriq","Politician says BJP 'broke PDP' to create new parties

Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and president of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on 21 March said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ""divided the PDP"" and formed new political parties in Jammu and Kashmir ""so as to suppress the voice of the people"". Interacting with the media in Anantnag, Mufti said after the revocation of special status of Kashmir in 2019, many political parties were formed in Jammu and Kashmir whose ""sole aim was to suppress the real voice"" of the people of Kashmir. She said the BJP is now trying to ""give power"" to these parties. She said the BJP also targeted her personally. Mufti said, ""I, my brother, and my aged mother were repeatedly summoned by the Enforcement Directorate and they even evicted me from my residence in the harsh winters."" She alleged that Jammu and Kashmir has been turned into a prison where anyone who raises his voice for his rights is suppressed by force. [Online, Approximate Words: 175]

Editorial says Kashmiris dissatisfied with health facilities

A 22 March editorial said people in Kashmir are not satisfied with health facilities in government hospitals, especially with the behaviour of doctors and other staff in the hospitals. The editorial said: ""People are still not satisfied with the health facilities in Jammu and Kashmir. The government has been engaged in providing modern facilities to government hospitals and other health centres for the past several years. Despite this, the misfortune is that the patients are not satisfied with the behaviour of the doctors and other staff there. There is no one to take care of patients who have no influence in these hospitals. Hospitals in rural areas have become mere referral centres for patients. Almost every patient who comes here is referred to a big hospital. Rather, it has been seen many times that patients are advised to go to private hospitals. The strange thing is that it is not possible to get treatment without a recommendation in two big hospitals of Kashmir. Perhaps being aware of this, the lieutenant governor has urged that health facilities should be provided equally to every citizen and there should be no discrimination. It is difficult to say whether this advice will be implemented in government hospitals. People sitting in such hospitals have proved to be very fearless and anti-public. They do not have any kind relationship with the patients. Rather, they have become accustomed to behaving very rudely with poor patients. Fearing them, people prefer to take their patients to hospitals outside Kashmir. Hundreds of patients go to Chandigarh, Amritsar, Delhi and even Faridabad for treatment. Such patients openly appreciate the kindness of the doctors and the passion of the other staff. Patients from there advise other people that it is better to spend lakhs of rupees outside than to spend a single rupee in hospitals in Kashmir. The only reason for this is not the professional ability of the doctors there, but their compassionate attitude."" [Online, Approximate Words: 700]

Editorial says poll body trying to ensure better voter turnout in Kashmir

A 22 March editorial said the Election Commission is taking measures to do away with the trend of low voter turnout in Kashmir and ensure increased voting in the forthcoming general elections. The editorial said: ""The Election Commission is taking steps to ensure free, fair, transparent and terror-free polling and for this, the public is being asked to vote in maximum numbers in the parliamentary elections. It is noteworthy that the commission has declared most of the polling stations in Jammu and Kashmir as 'dangerous' and the authorities have been asked to ensure that no law-and-order problem arises there. Due to terrorism, the voter turnout has been very low, and it has not been recorded more than 20-30% in Kashmir. On the contrary, the voter turnover in Jammu has always been between 60-70%. The chief electoral officer (CEO) said more parts of the Kashmir region have been declared unsafe after a recent exercise by the authorities. Therefore, the police have been asked to increase patrolling, initiate cordon and search operations, strengthen checkpoints, hold regular meetings of officers and collaborate with other security agencies to ensure peaceful elections. The CEO said the Election Commission has done away with the terms highly sensitive, sensitive and normal to ensure better turnout. He said that to prevent the activities of terrorists, anti-national elements and miscreants in vulnerable areas and critical polling stations, they have adopted a new procedure to ensure a healthy turnout.

If we talk about our oil and gas in general, then we sell about 40% of our export products for roubles and about 40% for Chinese yuans, with 20% [of deals done in] other currencies,"" Novak said.

""That means that the share of the dollar and the euro is actually reduced to a minimum. I think that this trend will continue,"" he added.

TASS also quoted the Russian deputy prime minister as saying that many other countries were also moving to transactions in local currencies, mainly due to restrictions imposed by the West.

""Of course, many of them see this. And they understand that these risks will also affect them at some point,"" Novak argued.

BBCSUP0020240326ek3q000m9,Russian TV news: Ukraine accused of orchestrating concert hall attack,"Main themes on Russian primetime TV news on NTV, Rossiya 1 and Channel One on 25 Mar 24

Suggestions of Ukraine's complicity in the deadly concert hall attack just outside Moscow were front and centre on the primetime TV bulletins on state-owned Rossiya 1 and state-controlled Channel One.","The attackers were radical Islamists and Tajikistan nationals, but the attack itself has ""Ukrainian fingerprints"" all over it, the channels told their viewers, echoing remarks made by President Putin at a meeting with his security services.

The two channels also accused the West of trying to exonerate Ukraine despite the supposed evidence pointing to its complicity; of allowing the attack to happen by giving Moscow insufficiently specific warnings; and of being more worried about the harsh treatment of the suspects than about the innocents killed in the attack.

Putin doubles down on suggestions of Ukraine's complicity

The deadly attack against the Crocus City Hall concert venue may have been committed by Islamist radicals but all the evidence points to Ukraine as the organiser of this terrorist outrage despite Western attempts to exonerate the 'neo-Nazi Kyiv regime', President Putin suggested late on 25 March during a video conference call with the heads of the Russian security services.

Channel One launched straight into Putin's lengthy remarks at the start of its primetime news bulletin. Rossiya 1 showed them at the end of its programme as soon as the footage was ready to air. NTV missed them because its primetime bulletin comes out too early, but aired them at the start of its late-night news.

""The crime was committed at the hands of radical Islamists... But we can also see that using various channels, the United States is trying to convince its satellites and other countries that according to its intelligence, there are no Kyiv fingerprints to be found on the Moscow terrorist attack, and that the deadly terrorist attack was committed by followers of Islam, by members of ISIS... We know very well whose hands were used to commit this outrage against Russia and its people. What we want to establish is who gave the order,"" Putin was shown saying.

He repeated the earlier Russian claim that the suspects were supposedly heading for the Ukrainian border when they were apprehended hundreds of miles from Moscow, and hinted at Western complicity by suggesting that ""those who have been fighting against our country using the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime as their instruments"" may have been behind the latest attempt to ""intimidate"" Russia.

The same narrative was promoted by Rossiya 1 and Channel One in other reports about the terror attack.

Rossiya 1 showed a pundit claiming that the ""signature"" of the attack was uncharacteristic of ISIS terrorists, and that the attackers must have been recruited online by the Ukrainian secret services.

It is common knowledge that Ukraine has been actively recruiting agents in Russian territory, arming them and providing them with detailed plans for future attacks, the pundit said.

Over on Channel One, a correspondent also made much of the unsubstantiated claim that the attackers were heading for Ukraine when they were apprehended, ignoring reports that the place where the suspects were caught is much closer to the Russian border with Belarus than with Ukraine.

The Russian-Ukrainian border ""is almost impossible to cross amid the ongoing special military operation"", but the attackers were promised a warm welcome on the Ukrainian side of the border, the correspondent claimed.

Hints at Western complicity

Putin's latest remarks aside, the bulletins on Rossiya 1 and Channel One were rife with accusations against the West over its possible role in the attack and its conduct in the immediate aftermath.

In the headline sequence at the top of the bulletin, Rossiya 1 suggested that exonerating Ukraine was the paramount US concern at the moment.

""The West is afraid of finding out that Ukraine may have been complicit in the terror attack in Moscow. How will they live with that knowledge?"" the channel wondered later in the programme.

""In the very first hours, when Russian investigators were only just starting to gather evidence and the attackers had not even been caught yet, the West had already settled on its preferred version of what had happened: Ukraine is above any suspicion, and the attack was committed by a branch of ISIS,"" the channel said in a tone of indignation.

It later suggested that US instructors had trained the Ukrainian secret services to commit precisely the kind of attacks that took place at the Crocus concert hall.

Another charge Rossiya 1 levelled at the West was that the Western warnings of an impending terror attack in Russia made in early March were deliberately vague and not actionable - and that the West therefore bears part of the blame.

The warning received from the US embassy in Moscow on 7 March ""did not contain any details"", and the White House is now refusing to offer Russia any assistance in the investigation, the channel told its viewers.

It then highlighted a clip in which a caller phones in to a French talk show and says in a Russian voiceover that the ""MI6, US intelligence, and we the French are to blame for what happened because instead of telling the world about the impending threat, we were all too busy trying to destabilise Russia and Putin"".

Treatment of the suspects

There was also much outrage on Rossiya 1 over the observation in the Western media that the suspects appear to have been badly beaten or even mutilated before they were paraded in front of TV cameras.

""According to reports in the Western media, they have more sympathy for the terrorists rather than the families of the victims,"" a Rossiya 1 presenter fulminated.

A Rossiya 1 correspondent later accused Germany's ""traditionally Russophobic Bild newspaper"" of trying to ""portray the butchers as victims"".

The channel itself made no secret of the suspects' physical condition when they appeared in court.

At one point it showed close-up footage of one of the suspects in court while a correspondent remarked on a huge and untidy bandage covering the man's right ear.

The channel made no mention of the graphic footage circulating on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels (and discussed with apparent approval by some of the top Russian newspapers) on which the suspect's ear is seen being deliberately cut off after he was apprehended.

Meeting with Krasnodar Territory Governor Veniamin Kondratyev","7 March 2024, Krasnodar

Vladimir Putin held a working meeting with Krasnodar Territory Governor Veniamin Kondratyev.

Starting the meeting, the President noted that the Krasnodar Territory was developing well, almost all its key performance indicators were good, and unemployment, which is at its lowest in the country, was below the national average in the region. Investment numbers are very good. Population growth is a core indicator, which, of course, raises social issues, such as increasing the number of ambulance crews and the capacity of kindergartens and schools.

Mr Kondratyev reported that the economy was steady and had adapted to the challenges and difficulties. The gross regional product amounted to four trillion rubles in late 2023 compared to two trillion rubles in 2018. Regional producers and businesses gained access to the domestic market. The ability to increase capacity and sell output on the domestic market is an important factor of growth.

The Governor also said that seven industrial parks had been built in the Krasnodar Territory, and seven more were under construction. Infrastructure loans, which the region receives from the federal budget as directed by the President, are crucial, especially for resorts. These loans will be used to build 17 treatment facilities on the Black Sea coast. The construction will begin this year.

Regarding the agro-industrial complex, last year's harvest was quite good, even though not a record breaker at 14.4 million tonnes, of which wheat accounted for 9.6 million tonnes. Enterprises had sown 1.8 million hectares with winter crops and started sowing spring crops on 1.8 million hectares as well. A decent harvest is expected this year. Agrarians have been provided with fuel, fertiliser, and seeds in full. As of the end of last year, the agrarians have purchased various types of agricultural machinery worth 23 billion rubles. The law on viticulture and wine making has launched a new industry which was non-existent in the region literally until 2019, when wine making was a garage business. Since the time the law was passed in 2019, 1.5 billion bottles of champagne and wine have been produced. Last year alone, 305 million bottles were produced. Drinking wine and champagne from local wine material derived from local grapes grown in the Krasnodar Territory is now a sign of sophistication.

Veniamin Kondratyev recalled that the Industrial Development Fund established with the President's support already has 7.1 billion rubles. These funds are spent on upgrading enterprises and import substitution production lines. The interest rate is kept low, under four percent. Last year, industrial product sales reached 1.8 trillion rubles. Owing to the fund, the amount of industrial output grew by almost 45 percent in five years.

Vladimir Putin also noted that investment in the health resort industry has increased a lot - from 18.6 billion to 488 billion. Veniamin Kondratyev said that due to the enactments of a corresponding territorial law, investment in new hotels has grown by 20 times since 2020. Currently, 48 hotels worth a total of almost 500 billion rubles are under construction in the Krasnodar Territory. About 30,000 new rooms will be ready for use by the end of next year. The Krasnodar Territory is the health resort and spa centre of the whole country. Last year, 18.6 million people spent their vacations there. This is a record, but not the limit. There will be demand for the hotels that are now under construction. The President emphasised the need to maintain continuous control over the quality of service.

Schools and kindergartens were discussed as well. According to Mr Kondratyev, 90 schools, 194 kindergartens and 214 sports facilities have been built since 2016 when he became governor. Of this number, 42 schools, 61 kindergartens, 49 sports facilities and 70 general practitioner offices and rural paramedic centres have been built under national projects in the past five years. A total of 1,300 parks and squares were also improved under a national project.

Vladimir Putin noted the need to focus on the facilities in poor shape. Their problems should be resolved as soon as possible. They should undergo major repairs or be replaced with new facilities. Mr Kondratyev explained that about 30 clinics are under major repairs while 43 hospitals have already been rebuilt. The Governor emphasised that on the whole, the Krasnodar Territory received 260 billion rubles under this national project. This amount of social construction is unprecedented for the region.

It identified the munition as the high-explosive 53-F-864 mortar projectile, the primary ammunition for 2S4 Tyulpan.

""It was clear that the freshly painted munition had been produced quite recently, although the production of these most powerful mines in the world had ceased several decades ago,"" Rossiyskaya Gazeta said.

The report noted that 2S4 Tyulpan mortars are part of the ""reserve of the supreme high command"".

""They are sometimes called 'doomsday' weapons, since their munitions can include nuclear mines with a TNT equivalent capacity of up to 2,000 tonnes. However, conventional high-explosive charges in Tyulpan's munitions are more than effective simply due to the unique characteristics of the mortar,"" it said.

Rossiyskaya Gazeta praised the accuracy of 2S4 Tyulpan and said that these heavy mortars are being used in Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Russia has forgiven Guinea-Bissau's debt totaling nearly $26.7m, with an additional $960,000 to be restructured, state news agency TASS reported on 19 March, citing the corresponding agreements between the two countries.","The debt covered by the first agreement includes about $25.1m under a 2001 agreement, related to past Soviet obligations, inclusive of accrued interest, as well as about $1.5 million for the rental of premises for the embassy in Moscow.

The second document concerns a debt and an accrued interest of about $960,000. Under the new agreement, Guinea-Bissau commits to spend this sum to finance projects aimed at enhancing the population's access to vital resources, among other objectives. Additionally, Russian companies should be granted access to competitive selection processes on terms no less favourable than those provided to local and other entities.

The two agreements are presented as continuing the past measures promised to be undertaken by Russia as a part of global debt relief initiatives.

TASS reminded that Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo met Russian President Vladimir Putin during the Russia-Africa summit in 2023. Putin then assured his counterpart of Moscow's support and noted the great potential of the African republic in cooperation in the extraction of minerals as well as energy and infrastructure projects.

Last year, Putin said that Russia had written off over $20bn from African countries and pledged more aid in a move thought by analysts to entice arms sales.

* * *

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon and welcome everyone.

This meeting with graduates of the Leaders of Russia format and platform is a regular event that is held with a simple goal in mind which is, first, to congratulate you on your achievements and, second, to hear what you have to say about the event and what you have learned during your contacts with each other and during conversations and classes that were held in various formats. This is the fifth class of graduates, and over a million people have been trained under this system over the years. Probably, this is the largest human resources forum internationally, not just in Russia, which is impressive.

It is crucial that the people with whom you met and talked and who formulated the tasks and assessed the results, have achieved much themselves and were in a position to assess your accomplishments objectively.

The third point that I would like to highlight is that this year you were able to work in the regions. I am aware there are people in this audience who work in the regions as part of their regular job, but nevertheless, it was important for everyone else to try their hand at addressing problems at the regional level. This is a critical element of training and competitive selection, as well as determining one's own abilities.

I would like to thank our colleagues in the regions, the regional leaders, for providing this opportunity.

I am also pleased to note that the number of applications, which was very large, includes more and more people who live permanently outside of Russia, but show interest in our country and want to work in Russia. They are eligible for expedited and simplified procedure for gaining Russian citizenship, and 29 people have already made that decision. These people were originally from 12 countries, such as the United States, France, Greece, and Bulgaria, as well as the CIS countries. A total of 29 people from 12 countries.

It is also important that we are involving our colleagues from the new territories, the new regions under the Leaders of Revival programme. I know that they are here as well. You will tell us how it all went.

You also know that we have opened a new page - this is the Time of Heroes [personnel programme]. They are in this audience as well - those who have taken part in serving the Motherland in the special military operation zone. We have been receiving applications since March and 30,000 applications have already been submitted.

Obviously, the selection must and will be strict enough. This will not be a one-time event but a regular process. So those who do not make it in the first attempt have every chance to send another application and get onto this platform. And for those who do not have a university degree, we will create the conditions for receiving it, if that's what they want, if they have such ambitions.

Obtaining a specific position is not an end in itself in these events. However, at least 470 people are already working in high positions and in the federal centre. I believe we have six deputy federal ministers, five deputy governors and governors in the regions, 10 people head municipalities (I see some of them here) while others work in the State Duma, the Federation Council, and our big companies with state participation - in general, in the most diverse areas and at a sufficiently high level.

It is very important that during this training, a certain community of people is taking shape. I am referring to those who undertake training and go through this competitive selection. What also matters, and I heard this from graduates in the previous years, is their ability to maintain these relations and exchange useful information that can be used at a specific job. I will repeat that this information comes from sources you trust and from the people that are very competent in their own areas.

This is probably all I wanted to say in the beginning. I would like to listen to you more, and I repeat, to hear your assessments and your proposals on improving this personnel selection system.

I have already said this many times, but I would like to repeat it again. The main advantage of this work, the main advantage of this system of training and selection is that it does not work through pull or by using one's connections. What matters is one's own personal and professional skills.

Go ahead please.

To be continued.

BBCSUP0020240327ek3r001p5,Russia: Number of close-up shots of Kadyrov in official videos said falling,"By BBC Monitoring

Russian investigative website Agentstvo says Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is no longer being shown close up in videos of him published on his Telegram channel and on government-controlled TV.","Agentstvo's finding is derived from an analysis of videos of Kadyrov's appearances at various public functions published on his Telegram channel. It follows speculation in independent Russian media in early autumn 2023 about Kadyrov's allegedly ill state of health.

According to Agentstvo, the latest video from ""an event with Kadyrov's participation"", dated 23 March, is different from the previous ones in that it has a fewer number of close-up shots of the Chechen leader. It said in the two-and-a-half-minute-long video Kadyrov was shown close up only four times (five by BBC Monitoring count) with each video sequence not exceeding 2 sec in duration.

A video report about the same event produced by state TV channel Grozny showed Kadyrov close up three times, and in all three instances his body posture was exactly the same, Agentstvo said.

Agentstvo said that while ""short"" close-ups are common for the videos published on Kadyrov's Telegram channel (rarely are they longer than 5 sec), ""as a rule"" Kadyrov appears in these videos ""far more often - normally several dozen times"".

It said no video published since 3 January included as few close-up shots of Kadyrov as that published on 23 March apart from three videos published on 5 February, 20 February and 16 March, all which were, Agentstvo pointed out, a minute shorter than the video published on 23 March.

Agentstvo also said that in the video published on 23 March Kadyrov spoke in Chechen ""slower than usual"". For comparison, it used a video published on 1 February.

Agentstvo said that in February Kadyrov had missed President Vladimir Putin's state-of-the-nation address for a second time in two years. Kommersant newspaper's Kremlin-friendly journalist Andrei Kolesnikov said then that Kadyrov had caught a cold, however Novaya Gazeta Europe said that he may have been undergoing a round of treatment.

Agentstvo said flight trackers suggested Kadyrov's plane had since late February been ""actively flying to Moscow"" where he according to Novaya Gazeta Europe has been receiving treatment.

Agentstvo also cited a Telegram channel that claims to report insider information saying that Kadyrov can now receive the same treatment in Chechnya after the delivery there of state-of-the-art medical equipment.

Reaction to return of veteran statesman as security chief","Many Iranian newspapers reacted this morning to the appointment of former parliament Speaker and veteran politician Ali Larijani as the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), Iran's top security body.

Larijani's appointment by President Massoud Pezeshkian, which had been speculated about for a week, followed the creation of a new Defence Council under the SNSC aimed at centralising strategic military decision-making.

Larijani previously held the same top security position from 2005 to 2007 and was parliamentary speaker from 2008 to 2020. He also registered his candidacy in the 2021 and 2024 presidential elections, but was disqualified by the hardline vetting body, the Guardian Council.

The state broadcaster-run daily Jaam-e Jam newspaper said ""With Larijani's appointment and the formation of the Defence Council, Iran has unveiled a new security and defence arrangement.""

Conservative daily Farhikhtegan said ""Larijani's return to the SNSC after 20 years signals a reconstruction of national affairs with a centrist approach"".

The paper in a separate op-ed said ""Larijani 3.0 must rebuild national unity from a centrist stance - neither the hardliner of the past nor the reformist ally of the Rouhani era"".

The reformist Sazandegi said Larijani's return could mean ""a shift from maximalist resistance to greater rationality in security policymaking"".

On X, Larijani's appointment was either welcomed or tacitly accepted by users from across the political spectrum.

Some users said the appointment signified changes in strategies of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, echoing recent speculation and chatter on upcoming senior staffing changes.

Others highlighted his nonpartisan nature and perceived ""moderate approach"", expecting a ""positive change"" in the top security body.

Some users described Larijani as a critic of hardliners, saying that a shift towards a more moderate approach was desperately needed in the current situation.

Meanwhile, some hardline figures sought to warn Larijani that he must adhere to Iran's conservative policies, especially in foreign policy especially towards the US and Trump's mounting pressure on Iran.

Hardline MP Amir Hossein Sabeti suggested Larijani was appointed to compensate for Pezeshkian's weaknesses.

Public offices closed in most provinces amid heat, energy crisis

Public offices in more Iranian provinces will be closed today. According to some outlets, 28 out of Iran's 31 provinces are affected.

State TV reported the closures in their morning bulletins today, but named only 13 provinces affected by the shutdowns, while state media cited ""over 20"" provinces. The reports and decisions on closures of new provinces were being released gradually until last night.

The shutdowns, aimed at saving electricity and water, come amid recurring blackouts and concerns over unprecedentedly bad water shortages this summer. Although Iran has been experiencing energy and water shortages for several years, the situation has significantly worsened this year.

State media has noted that essential service providers such as hospitals and select bank branches remain open during the closures in all affected provinces.

Iran executes alleged 'Mossad spy', 'IS terrorist'

The Iranian judiciary announced this morning that it had carried out the execution of an alleged Mossad spy and an ""Islamic State [IS] terrorist"".

In two separate reports, the judiciary-run Mizan News Agency described the individuals as ""an operative of the Mossad spy-terror network who had engaged in espionage"", named Roozbeh Vadi, and a ""member of Daesh [IS]"" who ""intended to carry out terrorist operations"", named Mehdi Asgharzadeh.

Mizan said Vadi was ""employed in one of the country's key and sensitive institutions, and given his level of access, he had become an attractive target"" for foreign intelligence. The report said he travelled to Vienna and met Mossad officers on five occasions.

Mizan also added that Vadi had provided Mossad with information about one of the Iranian nuclear scientists assassinated during the 12-day military campaign by Israel, which included targeting of top commanders and nuclear scientists.

On the case of the alleged IS member, Mizan said a ""terrorist cell's safehouse was identified before any attack could take place"" and that security forces ""killed four terrorists in an armed clash"" while raiding the house, while Asgharzadeh managed to flee and was later arrested."

The opposition-mindedness of the Far East has become a thing of the past, states Yevgeniya Stulova, head of the political technology committee at the Russian Association of Public Relations (RAPR).

BBCSUP0020240312ek3c000dy,Russia develops battlefield thermal masking system - report,"By BBC Monitoring

Russian scientists have developed a thermal screen coating called Teplosfera that makes it harder to detect military equipment using thermal imagers, pro-government newspaper Izvestia's website reported on 11 March.","The coating, based on polyurethane, has already been tested in the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and demonstrated its effectiveness, the report said.

The coating is a response to so-called ""kamikaze drones"" or unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) fitted with thermal-imaging sensors, analysts told Izvestia.

The new coating, which has been developed by Bauman Moscow State Technical University's (MGTU) Centre for Digital Materials Science, insulates vehicles, making them practically impossible to discern thermally, the report said.

The basis of the material is polyurethane and hollow-glass microspheres made by Russian manufacturers, it added.

The composition is a filled two-component polyurethane mastic with an adjustable curing rate in the temperature range from -20 to +40 degrees Celsius, according to the report.

Polyurethane has high deformation and strength properties (frost resistance, wear resistance) and high adhesion to the surfaces of various materials, it said.

Mastic based on it has the ability to liquefy under mechanical stress and increase viscosity at rest, so it can be applied to vertical and inclined surfaces manually or, after a slight dilution with a solvent, mechanically using airless sprayers, Alexander Kalinnikov, deputy director of the Bauman Digital Materials Centre, told Izvestia.

The coating can be applied to a range of equipment from cars to heavy armour and self-propelled guns, the report said, adding that Teplosfera also has civil applications, and is suitable for use as insulation in Arctic conditions.

Polyurethane has some disadvantages however, being flammable and breaking up over time due to exposure to sunshine and moisture, the report explained.

The proposed use of glass spheres as a thermal insulation additive is an interesting solution that can find application in the field of polyurethane-based thermal insulation materials for both household and special purposes, a scientist who spoke to the paper said.

The most difficult problem, however, may be avoiding overheating of equipment while moving under such a coating, the scientist added.

Crime

On 3 March, a special operation to neutralise suspected militants concluded in the city of Karabulak, after which law enforcers conducted a sweep of a flat where members of illegal armed groups plotting high-profile terrorist attacks in the region were hiding. The sweep aimed to determine the number of militants eliminated, estimated to be five to six people, while earlier reports of civilian casualties on social media were unfounded, with civilians evacuated from the operation area. (Magas.ru website, 3 Mar 24)

The identities of the militants eliminated in Karabulak were preliminarily given as supporters of the banned international terrorist organisation Islamic State, involved in several crimes including an attack on a traffic police post in the republic and the murder of three law enforcement officers last March. Three of the neutralised militants, including their leader, were on the federal wanted list. The operation resulted in no casualties among security forces or civilians, and automatic weapons, ammunition, grenades and explosive devices were found at the scene.

Ingushetia head Makhmud-Ali Kalimatov has instructed authorities to provide immediate assistance to all residents of Karabulak whose homes were damaged during the counter-terrorism operation. Construction and repair work will begin shortly to quickly restore damaged housing so that people could return to their normal lives.

Additionally, he directed the regional government to create a commission to assess the damage and tasked utility services with evaluating the infrastructure damage.

Netanyahu, Israeli army at odds over Gaza occupation plans","Israeli media this morning highlighted growing tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and army chief of staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir over plans to occupy the entire Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers told media that Netanyahu had decided to expand fighting in Gaza, against army recommendations and intensified public calls for a ceasefire, and used the phrase ""occupation of the Strip"".

Outlets further quoted ministers as saying: ""If this is not suitable for the chief of staff, let him resign.""

The public broadcaster Kan reported that Zamir may resign from his post if the plan is implemented.

According to the Ynet news site, Netanyahu is to raise the plan at a cabinet meeting today.

We will file a briefing on Israeli reporting and commentary on the issue.

Pan-Arab media highlight Israeli 'disagreements' over occupying Gaza

The UAE-based Sky News Arabia and Saudi-funded Al Arabiya reported this morning on the ""disagreements"" and ""division"" between senior Israeli officials.

Sky News Arabia said in one report: ""Netanyahu's decision apparently does not appeal to the military institution.""

Qatari flagship Al Jazeera highlighted reports according to which ""Trump granted Netanyahu the green light to occupy Gaza"".

A Palestinian analyst told Al Jazeera that Netanyahu ""aims to tame the Israeli military and security institution"".

Another expert argued that this option would cost Israel ""a very high price in confrontations in the field in terms of human losses"".

Qatar-based Al-Araby TV's correspondent in Gaza said the Israeli army already controls most areas in Gaza, either with ground troops or through air strikes and shelling.

We will file a briefing on pan-Arab media coverage.

Hamas urges UNSC to stop Gaza 'genocide'

Hamas has called on the UN Security Council, which will hold a session today to discuss the conditions of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, to pressure Israel to stop what it describes as the ""genocidal war"" in Gaza.

Hamas called on the UNSC ""to issue clear and binding resolutions to the occupation to halt its genocidal war, including massacres, violations, starvation and the destruction of civilian life in Gaza,"" in a Telegram post yesterday, quoting senior group official Osama Hamdan.

Hamdan urged the UNSC to oblige Israel to withdraw from Gaza, open border crossings to humanitarian aid and stop its violations against prisoners in Israeli jails.

He also condemned what he called ""the US-backed occupation's policy of distributing aid as part of a plan to engineer starvation and chaos"".

Israeli media persist in denying Gaza hunger crisis

As photos of emaciated children in Gaza continue to emerge, prompting global outrage over Israel's restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid, Israeli media have largely refrained from reporting on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Israeli media have largely cast reports of hunger in Gaza as ""false Hamas propaganda"", saying images of starving children are fake or only show those with pre-existing health conditions.

Minimal Israeli reporting on the crisis in Gaza has largely assigned blame for any suffering there to Hamas and even then has been met with strong domestic criticism.

However, a recently leaked WhatsApp chat between journalists at the popular Channel 12 News revealed internal debates over whether they should be covering the issue.

Israeli government votes to dismiss attorney general

The Israeli government voted unanimously yesterday to dismiss Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, the chief prosecutor in Netanyahu's ongoing corruption case.

Baharav-Miara has frequently been at odds with the government, challenging the legality of a number of its moves including its controversial judicial overhaul plan.

According to domestic reports, the Supreme Court issued an injunction blocking the move.

The attempt to remove Baharav-Miara is the latest in a fierce battle between Netanyahu's government and the legal system.

The Ynet new site quoted Justice Minister Yariv Levin as saying during the government discussion on the attorney general's firing: ""It is impossible to accept a situation in which the court will try to impose on the government a legal adviser who is completely political.""

Growing protests reported in southern Yemen

Yemeni media reported escalating protests yesterday over poor public services in the southern city of Seiyun in Hadramawt province.

Demonstrators marched towards the city's main government building in protest over prolonged power outages. They also lamented the rising cost of living, exacerbated by the collapse of the Yemeni rial and rise in basic goods and energy prices, demanding an improvement in essential services.

The privately-owned Al-Masdar Online reported that demonstrators also erupted in several other districts in Hadramawt including al-Mukalla, Tarim and Shihr.

We are watching for further developments.

Houthis claim new Ben Gurion strike

The Houthi movement has claimed a new strike on Israel's main international airport, saying it was an act of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.

The group's military spokesman, Yahya al-Sarea, said in a statement this morning that the rebel forces had fired a ""Palestine 2"" hypersonic ballistic missile at Ben Gurion Airport, noting that it had ""successfully achieved its goal"".

Repeating the language of previous statements, he added that the attack had ""caused millions of Zionists to flee to shelters, bringing the airport to a standstill"".

The Israeli military said on X late yesterday that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen after air sirens sounded in several areas in Israel.

The Houthis also claimed an attack on the airport on 1 August.

Coming up

The Lebanese cabinet will discuss today the disarmament of Hezbollah, a key US and Israeli demand, in what domestic media have described as a ""decisive"" session.

The discussion will also include a timetable for the group's disarmament.

Leaders of the Iran-backed group have repeatedly refused to give in to the demand to disarm, saying the problem is in Israel's continued attacks against Lebanon despite a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024."

BBCSUP0020240311ek3b000xd,Video of alleged IS member involved in Ingushetia shoot-out shared online,"By BBC Monitoring

A high-profile supporter of Islamic State group (IS) has shared a video showing a man pledging allegiance to the jihadist group and who was said to have been among the suspected IS militants killed in a shoot-out with police in the Russian North Caucasus republic of Ingushetia on 2 March. IS has not officially claimed any link with this incident.","Last week, the Russian authorities said that said six suspected IS fighters were killed in an anti-terrorist operation following a clash in the town of Karabulak in Ingushetia on 2 March. They said that the men had been behind an attack on a traffic police post and the killing of three police officers in March 2023.

On 10 March, the pro-IS Telegram channel ""Tafa'ul Mustamir"" (Constant Interaction) shared the 02:46-minute video. It was subsequently promoted by another prominent pro-IS media outlet, ""Bariqa News Agency"".

The video features one man who holds a rifle, with the trademark black IS banner behind him, as he ""renews"" his pledge of loyalty to IS leadership.

He delivers his message in very good Arabic, but with a slight accent, indicating he is not a native speaker of the language. The video does not indicate the date of recording.

While the speaker does not identify himself nor speaks about any specific events in the clip shared online, the post by Tafa'ul Mustamir identifies him as ""Abd al-Karim al-Ingushi [from Ingushetia]"". It says he and his ""brothers"" (fellow militants) ""died fighting the criminal Russian authorities in Karabulak, Ingushetia""

The speaker, however, does indicate that he is a member of IS's so-called Caucasus Province branch, which is one of the least active of IS's global affiliates. The last time that branch claimed an attack was on 28 December 2020, when it said one of its militants killed a police officer in Chechnya.

The message

In the short video, the speaker says ""we the mujahidin of the Caucasus wilayah [IS branch]"" urge IS's ""caliph"", Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, to be resolute on the path of jihad and ""be fair on all matters"". He tells him to ""march on"", assuring him ""there are men behind you [who have your back]"".

Following from that, he ""renews"" his pledge of allegiance to Abu Hafs.

The speaker then turns to address ""our brother mujahidin everywhere, particularly those in Syria, Khorasan [Afghanistan-Pakistan region] and Africa"", expressing his ""love"" and ""solidarity"".

He also tells his fellow jihadists in these branches to avoid divisions and differences, adding that ""we must be like a single body against the infidels"".

It is unclear if this was general advice against disunity, or implies possible internal divisions across some branches. The same goes for the advice to Abu Hafs to be ""fair to all"" and firm on the path of jihad, and whether that too was general advice or implied some deeper meaning.

The speaker concludes his message by addressing male and female prisoners affiliated to IS, telling them ""we have not forgotten about you nor ever will"", adding that ""freeing you is our priority"".

Such messages to IS-linked prisoners is a staple of IS leadership addresses, which often tell the group's followers worldwide to make the freeing of prisoners their ""topmost priority"".

IS itself has not shared the latest video nor indicated any involvement in the 2 March clashes in Ingushetia.

Presidential election","The Far Eastern Federal District demonstrated a high average voter turnout and the best regional results in the country amidst a record low number of violations in the presidential election held on 15-17 March, the Telegram channel Neshport said on 17 March. As a result, experts expect an ""extremely high level of support"" for incumbent President Vladimir Putin. ""The election campaigning was held without excessive information and administrative pressure. On the contrary, constant attempts to rock the boat via social networks had the opposite effect,"" pundit Alexander Asafov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, said. According to him, the high voter turnout stemmed from the proper arrangement of voting and few instances of election violations and ballot stuffing. The population's trust in the federal authorities has considerably grown over the past five years thanks to both unprecedented support measures and the authorities' care for local residents, the expert said.

Political analyst Mikhail Kuznetsov attributed the high voter turnout to the successes of the socioeconomic development in the district in recent years, whereas pundit Yevgeny Chadayev emphasised Far Easterners' patriotic feelings that came to the fore in decision-making. ""In a situation of the special military operation [the war on Ukraine], external challenges and the sanctions pressure on Russia new political views have formed. People are very patriotically-minded. They cast their votes for our state. I visited eight polling stations today and saw a genuine desire to defend our motherland everywhere,"" the expert said.

""There is nothing unusual in the high voter turnout: this is a cocktail of society's high confidence about the need to save Russia and its being tired with external pressure. In fact, the West provided for these voting results on its own by endlessly showering Russians with sanctions,"" the Telegram channel DFO.INFO claimed.

The following is the text of Zelensky&#8217;s speech posted on the presidential website in English on 31 March:

Dear Ukrainians! And everyone who stands with Ukraine!","Two years ago, the whole world saw the true meaning of our battle here in Ukraine.&#160;

Everyone for whom it was, unfortunately, just ""another war"" saw it.&#160;

They saw what kind of war it is. That Ukraine is defending not only its state border and sovereignty.

For us, this is a war to defend Ukraine and everything that makes people human.

That is why this war is of global significance. This is a war for the right to exist for our state and, at the same time, for the right to life for every person. It is a war for dignity for our people and for every nation that seeks its own destiny. This is a war so that no one dares to become a beast towards others.

When our warriors drove Russia out of Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, the entire Kyiv Region, and then Sumy and Chernihiv regions, everyone could see that these were victories not only of Ukrainian courage and weapons, but also of human morality.&#160;

Ukrainians then began to restore normal life wherever Russia had brought death and torture, looting and sadism.

And our people killed by the occupiers, whose bodies were on the streets of Bucha, were evidence that no one in the world should stay away from this battle. Because it is here, in Ukraine, defending our people, our lives, our state, that humanity is prevailing.

To unleash such acts of aggression against others, Russia first destroyed its own morality and made violence and hatred its ideology. Such systems don't just stop. Force stops them. Unity stops them. Determination and understanding what exactly they want to destroy stops them.

I am proud of everyone who dedicates their lives to ensuring that the life of our entire Ukraine is preserved.

I thank everyone in the world who really helps us.&#160;

And may the whole world never forget the cost of this battle and the evil we are holding back here on our land. Let us now observe a minute of silence in memory of all our people whose lives were taken by the occupiers.

Thank you.

Dear Ukrainians,","Today, throughout many cities and communities of our state, municipal services, repair teams, and energy workers have been tirelessly working on the aftermath of the Russian terrorist attack that occurred on Friday. People have been working continuously for the second day.

At this moment, normal power supply has been restored almost everywhere. There were some problems today in our city of Odesa &#8211; there were emergency shutdowns. Everything possible is being done to normalize the situation. Unfortunately, in Kharkiv, it's still very challenging. Today, there was another missile strike from Russia &#8211; these strikes continue daily. And everyone who is working to keep normal life in Kharkiv, in the region, in other border cities and communities, they are all true heroes. I thank every rescuer of our State Emergency Service of Ukraine, all employees of energy companies involved, police officers, local services, volunteers &#8211; everyone who is helping. Thank you for your dedication to protecting people!

I want to specifically acknowledge and thank the experts in Ivano-Frankivsk region, Vinnytsya, Khmelnytskyy, Sumy region, Poltava region, our Dnipropetrovsk region, and Zaporizhzhya. Thank you for your efficient work! Today, I received reports from the regions, from the head of the government, from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, of course, from our military. The state must ensure a systematic response to every Russian strike.

I also want to recognize all the leaders of states, heads of international institutions, and all our partners who have expressed their support for Ukraine these days. It is important to act together every time missiles and drones attempt to destroy our lives. To act to reduce the potential for terror, to block it. This particularly concerns air defense systems, as well as sanctions. All these Iskander, Kinzhal and other Russian missiles have dozens of components imported for terror from other countries. The missiles used in this attack against Ukraine, against our energy system, had at least three hundred types of components from ten countries. Together with the ""Shahed"" drones, there were at least seven and a half thousand components in total. Each of them represents a violation of sanctions regimes against Russia, each one represents someone's attempt to make money from destroying lives. This needs to be stopped.

Another thing. What happened yesterday in Moscow is obvious, both Putin and other scoundrels simply try to blame everything on someone else. They always resort to the same methods. It's been done before. There have been blown-up houses, shootings, and explosions. And they always blame others. They have come to Ukraine, burn our cities &#8211; and try to blame Ukraine. They torture, rape people &#8211; and accuse them. They have brought hundreds of thousands of their terrorists here, to Ukrainian land, they fight against us, and they don't care what's happening inside their own country. Yesterday all this happened, and this absolute miserable Putin, instead of attending to his own citizens of Russia, addressing them, remained silent for a day &#8211; thinking about how to link this with Ukraine. Everything is absolutely predictable. Those hundreds of thousands of Russians who are now killing on Ukrainian land would surely be enough to stop any terrorists. And if the Russians are ready to silently die in ""Crocus Halls"" and not ask any questions to their security and intelligence agencies, then Putin will try to turn such a situation to his personal advantage again.

Terrorists must always lose. I thank everyone who truly defends life! I'm grateful to all our people who are fighting against terror. And around the world, we must defend against those who consider people merely expendable.

Glory to Ukraine!

BBCUKB0020240315ek3f000rt,Russian polls will largely not affect Belarus - pundits,"The following is the text of the article by Danila Lutskevich, entitled ""What can be expected from the election in Russia and how will it affect Belarus? Analysts talk"", published on the Belarusian website Nasha Niva on 13 March; subheadings have been inserted editorially:

Putin&#8217;s legitimacy could weaken","Russian pundit Abbas Galyamov has said that in terms of the formal results, there will be nothing unexpected. ""But questions could arise from the point of view of real content. Will the real sense of Putin&#8217;s legitimacy correspond to the official data?"" [he said]. Galyamov believes that the overwhelming majority of Russians, both inside the country and abroad, think the entire process of the vote is falsified.&#160;

""It is too clear to everyone, since even in the beginning stage of preparing for the election, not one single alternative candidate has been allowed. There is noone among those allowed to run who has spoken out against the war. The authorities have completely removed people&#8217;s choice since the issue of the war is the main issue on the Russian political agenda"", the expert said.

The pundit explains that candidates like [Yekaterina] Duntsova or [Boris] Nadezhdin not being allowed to run by sayings that the Kremlin, looking over its shoulder at Belarus, tried to avoid mistakes made there and did not allow anyone to run who could become a Russian Tsikhanowskaya.

Galyamov noted he was certain events would develop in that way.&#160;

""They saw what can happen with the example of [Belarusian former presidential candidate Svyatlana] Tsikhanowskaya. Those in the Kremlin understand that if a candidate were running with a specifically anti-war position, then no matter what their personal qualities were, Putin would have no chance"", the expert said.&#160;

In his opinion, about one-third of Russians were against the war initially, but now a large number of people disappointed in or simply tired of the war have joined them.

""So it was clear from the very beginning that the Kremlin would not allow any anti-war candidate to run, so as not to see a repeat of the Tsikhanowskaya phenomenon"".

Speaking of changes Russia can expect after the vote, the pundit listed growth in discontent, increased suppression and a possible new wave of mobilisation. In terms of repression, Galyamov said Putin behaves more flexibly and intelligently than [Belarusian President Alyaksandr] Lukashenka [Alexander Lukashenko].

""He understands that that path is a dead end and will try to take as few steps as possible on it until the very end, attempting to get by without employing repression and using it only where ends cannot be met without it.

""In contrast to Putin, Lukashenka immediately started on that path. But it was easier for him, since even without legitimacy, Lukashenka still has Putin to help him. But Putin does not have his own Putin like that"".

As far as the likelihood of protest is concerned, Galyamov noted that there is not enough mass discontent for it to begin: ""There has to be a sense that the regime is weak, a sense that the protest will not be in vain. In a situation when you cannot expect anything from a protest except repression, there will be no protest"".

At the same time, Galyamov said: ""If, for example, the protest 'Noon against Putin' really does become massive, then the result will be a sharp decrease in his legitimacy. You could say it has been 'limping on one leg' until now. There was a sense that the president was doing something not quite right, but at the same time, the majority understood that he had the right to his post.

""After this election, his legitimacy will probably 'limp' on two legs. It is likely that not only will the sense of our not liking the course he takes increase, but that he will lose the right to speak in the name of the people. After this current election, the opinion could form that he does not have the right to speak for 150m Russian citizens and that he is not a president elected by all of the people, but a usurper"", the expert said.

He said that if events unfolded in that way, it would significantly weaken Putin&#8217;s position. Including his relationship with the elite. ""In situations like these, there are conspiracies, mutinies in the military and coups. And so although the situation will formally remain the same, its content will change"", Galyamov said.&#160;

But nothing will change for Belarus

As far as Belarus is concerned, the Russian pundit said one should not expect any changes in relations with our country after the election in the Russian Federation.&#160;

Alyaksandr Klaskowski, an analyst with the Pozirk agency, believes one should not expect any surprises from the presidential election in Russia. Klaskowski said the Russian opposition&#8217;s plan for the ""Noon against Putin"" protest is a weak strategy: ""The mechanism for falsifying the election in Russia is as well worked out as in Belarus, so we can only be talking about Putin being reelected, and his simply 'sealing' a new term for himself"".

Putin&#8217;s being elected to a new term does not change anything for Belarus overall, or for Lukashenka in particular. ""I think that for Lukashenka, Putin&#8217;s being reelected will have political consequences, since he will get an indirect carte blanche for his own reelection. If you imagine Putin naming his own successor, then the Kremlin could pose questions to Lukashenka. But if Putin gets a new term, then the field of play is open for Lukashenka, and he will have no psychological barriers"".

The analyst said Putin and Lukashenka currently have a good relationship. And the Kremlin only really had thoughts of replacing Lukashenka in 2020 when Moscow, during the mass protests, thought Belarus would not be able to get out of its political crisis.

""But Lukashenka cemented the situation using repression. Besides that, Putin started a full-scale war against Ukraine, one in which Lukashenka acted as an ally"", Klaskowski said.

In his opinion, the Kremlin is quite satisfied with Lukashenka right now and does not intend to change horses midstream. Klaskowski does not think Putin will want to absorb Belarus after the election as a consolation prize for the lack of large successes in Ukraine: ""Belarus&#8217;s dependence on Russia is growing bit by bit without that, and that is probably satisfactory to the Kremlin. And it can also be used well as a counter to Ukraine. As if to say, see, if you are friends with Russia, everything will be good.""

Dear Ukrainians,","A few important points this week:

Firstly, we continue to reboot our state institutions. Several changes have been made this week, and there are still more decisions in preparation. Today, new decrees regarding advisors were issued. I am grateful to everyone for their work. We are making the Office more functional.

Secondly, last night, as almost always during this war, our mobile fire groups, other air defense units, and the Air Force had things to do &#8211; successful target interceptions. Thank you to all the soldiers and commanders who defend us, and who save Ukraine from Russian terror. During this day, the warriors of the mobile fire groups in Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Kherson, and our Odesa region distinguished themselves. Thank you!

Thirdly, our energy workers, repair teams, and construction workers have worked tirelessly throughout the week. These are the people working on recovery efforts after Russian strikes, as well as protecting energy facilities in various regions. They are many, and they literally save our country's normal life. These are thermal power plant employees, engineers, grid masters, and electricians. These are the people who restore generation and power. I would like to thank everyone who works so hard to ensure that Ukraine can live normally, with power and the ability to work, in all cities and villages.

Russian terrorists are currently carrying out such heinous attacks in an attempt to drain Ukraine's power. We sent necessary signals and concrete requests to all of our partners who have the necessary air defense systems and missiles. America, Europe, and other partners all know exactly what we need, and they all understand how critical it is to assist Ukraine in defending itself against these strikes right now. I thank all leaders who are demonstrating leadership right now, especially those who truly uphold our agreements and keep&#160;their&#160;word.

I also want to personally thank those people here in Ukraine, those workers in the energy sector, who have distinguished themselves with their work in these days and weeks.

Everyone must now do their part &#8211; one hundred percent &#8211; so that Ukraine largely achieves what is needed. I thank all of you who live by this rule now.

The foreign minister of Moldova's breakaway Transnistria, Vitaliy Ignatyev, has said that the stockpiles of the Russian arms, which have been stored in the Cobasna depots for over three decades, ""pose a certain threat"" to the region. He denied reports that the separatist authorities were against their removal and disposal, but pointed out that the depots are the Russian property and the issue cannot be resolved without Moscow's involvement.","Ignatyev said this in an interview with the Russian RTVi TV channel, the transcript of which was published by the Transnistrian government-funded Novosti Pridnestrovya news agency on 27 March.

He started by defending the presence of the two Russian military contingents in Transnistria.

""We view the Russian [military] presence exclusively from the viewpoint of ensuring security: there is the peacekeeping operation and the [Russian military contingent, the OGRT, which] safeguards the arms depots that historically remained on our territory,"" Ignatyev explained.

""These huge stockpiles of arms and munitions remain on our territory. They certainly pose a certain threat and creates risks,"" he said.

Asked ""how many tens of thousands of tons of munitions"" were stored in Cobasna, he replied: ""Well, there are tens of thousands of tones. I cannot tell you exactly how many because I am not a specialist. But they are stored there. They did not vanish and they do require proper maintenance and safeguarding.""

He rejected accusations that Transnistria was against their removal and disposal.

""They try and accuse Transnistria of our objection to removing these arms and munitions. The Moldovan side often speculates that the munitions should be taken away. But one should understand that this amount and conditions of the munitions [the bulk of which is believed to be obsolete] make it impossible to grab a shopping bag and take them somewhere. Where to? There are some munitions that cannot be transported any longer. In other words, they should be disposed of. But this is a complex process: factories should be built there and we need to ensure their ecological and physical safety.

""We know for sure that the Russian side was ready for that. In 2019, Russian Defence Minister [Sergei Shoigu] visited our region and Moldova. His initiative had to do with resolving the munitions problem. But as I understand, the Moldovan side was not prepared for that at the time. So the things are where they were,"" Ignatyev said.

He stressed that ""all reasonable people would like to get rid of this problem"".

""We are trying to explain to our Moldovan colleagues... that we need to find common ground for that, that certain issues should be resolved for that purpose and that we need advanced technologies and serious funding,"" he added.

Ignatyev agreed with the interviewer ""that the munitions cannot be moved anywhere without Russia's consent"". ""This is the Russian property,"" he said.

During the interview, Ignatyev also repeated his earlier statements about Moldova's allegedly hostile economic steps, the need to revive the Transnistrian conflict settlement process and hopes for international recognition.

BBCUKB0020240329ek3t000p1,Newspaper warns neighbours against attacking Belarus,"The following is the text of the article by Alyaksandr Tsishchanka, entitled ""Belarus calls on its neighbours to not cross 'red lines'"", published on the Belarusian progovernment website Belarus Segodnya on 28 March, subheadings appear as in the original article:

The borders of peace","The situation around our country is growing worse. People are trying to drag us into processes which are completely detached from our own constructive interests. During a working visit to Hrodna Region, The [Belarusian] president [Alyaksandr Lukashenka, Alexander Lukashenko] stressed that any provocation against us would be cut off hard and fast.&#160;

[Insertion] Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, during a meeting to assess the battle readiness of units and groups in Ashmyanski District on 26 March 2024: &#160;""If they violate the state border - destroy them. No-one should be handled with kid gloves. And that is how we will act. Because any violation of the state border means destruction. They only understand force.""&#160;

Why one needs to know history

The West is trying to tie us up in an arms race, and push us to militarise fruitful border lands and get us to pour human and material resources into military programmes and events. Military contingents belonging to countries whose capital are thousands of kilometres from us and with whom we have no common borders are being deployed densely along our border. The goal in this is clear - they are testing our resilience.&#160;

German battalions and an American tank battalion have already taken up military positions in Lithuania's Pabrade. All of this is being done with clear designs of sabotage in mind.&#160;

Almost 150 Nato military, transport and reconnaissance aircraft are now based at Lithuanian airfields. The intensity and nature of this aviation group along our border is not merely hostile, they are provocative in every sense.&#160;

Thousands of Nato soldiers are training their battle skills at military training fields 15 kilometres from our border, working out tactics and ways of invading our territory.&#160;

Along the southern line, we already see the positions reflecting the best French lines dating to the era of Napoleon, whose standards are still remembered from the disgraceful rout in 1813 and the frozen fingers of French soldiers who miraculously survived Belarusian partisans, first on their way to Moscow and then on their way back to Paris.&#160;

And just like carbon copy paper, the gloomy and infamous Bundeswehr has decided to accommodate itself to our north. During the Great Patriotic War they also got it handed to them by republican partisans. So bad that steel German boot heels flashed as they ran away.&#160;

Is history for them really so covered in honey? One wonders why they are coming back again?

A convincing warning

Here I must note that any of our offers about transparent relations, peace initiatives and cooperation have been unilaterally rejected and flatly blocked with open hostility.

Unfortunately, we have been forced to mirror these actions on our side. But our main objective is not to frighten, but to convince the military leadership of our neighbours that we are not here hunting mushrooms, that we are not joking around and that any provocation will be cut off hard and fast without any warning shot or any chance for a second take. We have been patient for too long in indulging the disdain they have for us to even inadvertently push a peaceful situation into the rut of a conflict. But that was possible at former balances of force.

Now we see a systemic growth on the line of contact along our border. The growth of military potential enabled by the administrations of our neighbours makes any condescension not only improper, but also very dangerous for our country and population.

Those who accuse us of threatening to attack were the first to exit peace agreements and revoke and break all agreements about military parity. The bordering side treats any step towards agreement exclusively as a loss and defeat. And so there is no-one to make any agreement with on any topic today.&#160;

Yes, that line of behaviour was put in place by those who inhabit Nato's eastern flank. And by this same scheme, they are the kamikazes of the North Atlantic alliance. Well, what else can one think about countries where the last drops of industry and economy are being destroyed and whose territory is being used to move military infrastructure for Nato contingents towards Drang nach Osten? They are simply being used in the classic, throwaway scenario. And that's it. Nothing more.

That is what the president is trying to warn colleague neighbours in the Baltics, Poland and Ukraine.&#160;

A fragile edge

During an inspection of units and subunits along the border in Hrodna Region, the head of state took the moment to demonstrate that we are also serious, but that we have a better plan, which would allow everyone, and not just one side, to survive. We are calling on our neighbours to stop and not unloose the knot of aggression.

Everyone has already practically shown they are ready to and capable of crossing into what we call active movement. There is no sense in sabre rattling. Our side does not intend to war with our neighbours, the West, Nato or anyone at all - that is our main message to everyone. We are happy to turn our swords into plowshares, just give us a reason. For now it is impossible to get rid of the fear always threatening everyone.&#160;

Lukashenka noted in Hrodna Region that we are an economically and politically strong country, we are a nuclear and space state and the ""red lines"" are not just a drawing on a map, but the thin and fragile edge between life and death. We only want one thing - mutual respect. And so the president's peaceful message to our neighbours is like that marking on fragile cargo designating everyone's responsibility for peace and life - ""do not shake and do not throw"".

BBCUKB0020240322ek3m000dx,Belarus refines military registration rules,"The following is the text of the article by Yuliya Demyashka, entitled ""The system for military registration is improving - Khrenin on innovations to legislation on national security issues"", published on the Belarusian website&#160; Belarus Segodnya on 20 March:

The system for military registration, call-up notices and ensuring citizens&#8217; attendance to events when summoned is being improved, Belarusian Defence Minister Viktar Khrenin said during a meeting of the 11th session of the Republican Council of the National Assembly on 20 March, when draft law ""On amendments to laws on national security issues"" was presented. He said legislation was being brought in line with laws ""On the All-Belarusian People&#8217;s Assembly"" and ""On the people&#8217;s militia"". Overall, the draft law envisions changes to 12 laws.","""During times of war and during periods of mobilisation, citizens will be obliged to appear at recruitment points after receiving a notice by SMS,"" Khrenin said, discussing the innovations in the draft law, ""In peacetime, these SMS messages will be an additional source of information for citizens. The manner in which citizens will undergo medical examinations when being summoned to military service is being simplified. Specifically, by removing the obligation to undergo a medical examination immediately before being sent to serve in the armed forces, the chances of unscrupulous citizens evading military service will be minimised"".

The minister added that the age at which male citizens are initially added to military service rolls is being raised from 16 to 17 years, which will make it possible to bring the results of citizens&#8217; medical waivers as close as possible to the time they are registered or called to serve in the military.

""The list of those obligated to serve but who are given deferrals to mobilise is being clarified and this will make it possible for the most socially vulnerable categories of citizens to obtain deferrals,"" Khrenin said. ""The list of military registration and call-up events for which those obliged to serve can obtain the right to temporarily leave their jobs while their jobs and average wages are retained for them and compensation for travel expenses is provided is being widened. State security agencies are being given the authority to draft protocols on administrative violations against citizens on registration rolls for failing to appear to be registered without admissible reasons. Sanctions are being raised against citizens who violate rules on military registration, fail to appear for military service or who fail to appear to be registered. The maximum fine for violations of military registration rules is being increased from five to 30 base units"".

The ability for citizens to participate voluntarily in defence-related work during peacetime is also being reviewed.

""Compensation for such work will be provided by paying the average wage at their place of employment or by paying out a fixed sum for those citizens who are unemployed,"" Khrenin said. ""The obligation for local executive and administrative bodies to pay insurance and retirement premiums for citizens during call-ups and mobilisation training is being strengthened, with exceptions for citizens who have such guarantees and compensation from their places of employment.""&#160;

The minister also said that an authorised body is being established to draft state policy on preparing the economy for mobilisation. Military draft officers will be given the right to limit citizens&#8217; rights to exit the country in ways that violate military registration rules or for evading military registration or military service. Prior to this, the restriction did not apply to military service and did not extend to the category of people ""summoned to military training"".

The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyy, has said that the General Staff has ""significantly"" revised downward its target of mobilising 500,000 Ukrainians.","""After reviewing our internal resources and the combat strength of the Armed Forces, this figure was significantly reduced,"" Syrskyy said, as quoted by the Ukrayinksa Pravda website, when asked about the previously voiced mobilisation targets.

""We expect that we will have enough people capable of defending the Motherland. This includes not only the mobilised but also volunteers,"" he noted.

According to Syrskyy, the General Staff is currently reviewing the&#160;size of certain units that do not participate in fighting, based on an audit of their activities. He noted that this made it possible to send thousands of servicemen to combat units.

""However, it is necessary to refrain from extremes. All armies of the world have personnel who do not take part in combat operations, but provide for combat units. This is an equally important part of the work,"" he noted.

Also, the general said that citizens who join the army under mobilisation ""do not immediately go to the front"", with the vast majority of such people being sent to training centres. According to Syrskyy, the number of people undergoing such training, as of February 2024, was 84% of the total number of those mobilised.

In December 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Ukrainian military required an additional 450,000-500,000 of newly mobilised personnel.

Security chief arrives in Lebanon after Iraq visit","Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Ali Larijani this morning arrived in Lebanon following a two-day visit to Iraq.

Before departing, Larijani told reporters that ""the Resistance is part of the fabric of the people of the region"" and called it to be supported.

Iran refers to the pro-Iranian groups across the region as the ""Axis of Resistance"", or simply the ""Resistance"".

Ahead of Larijani's departure, some Iranian outlets highlighted Lebanese users on X apparently welcoming him with pro-Iranian hashtags.

Hassan Kazemi Qomi, a former ambassador to Iraq (2006-10) and ambassador to Afghanistan (2022-24), told Iranian state TV yesterday that the US and Israel seek to disintegrate regional states like Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and that ""Resistance groups are the only obstacle"".

He also said accusations that Iran commands ""proxy forces"" are false. Groups like Hezbollah defend their nations, while Israel ""is the West's true proxy for destabilisation"", he said.

Kazemi Qomi also said demands to disarm ""Resistance"" factions aim to clear the path for US-Israeli domination, but ""regional peoples will never accept surrender or partition"".

Online anger after government spokesperson downplays Zangazur corridor

Iranian online users criticised government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani who during a news conference yesterday, pointing to the map, dismissed concerns regarding the so-called Zangazur corridor, saying it was just a ""little part"" of Iran's borders.

A prominent anti-establishment user said on X she would say the same about three islands in the Gulf, controlled by Iran and claimed by the UAE, maintaining that ""reformists"" do not care about national interests.

Hardline users were equally critical of her, with one saying that ""it would be no surprise if tomorrow they declare the Persian Gulf a small, insignificant speck of water"".

A hardline journalist said that ""Iran is losing the war of corridors"".

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi yesterday told his Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan by phone that the new route agreed in the recently signed US-brokered Armenia-Azerbaijan deal ""must not cut Iran's access to other communication routes"".

Iranian outlets also cited Armenian media as saying yesterday that President Pezeshkian would visit Armenia on 18-21 August in the wake of the deal.

Police say Iran arrested 21,000 during Israel war

Police spokesman Brig Gen Saeed Montazerolmahdi said yesterday that 21,000 individuals were arrested during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June. He did not say how many were released.

Montazerolmahdi added that the police detained 2,774 undocumented foreign nationals, uncovering 30 special security cases from their phones. They also arrested 261 people suspected of espionage, and held 172 individuals for unauthorised filming.

Iranians react to Netanyahu's address on water issues, call for uprising

Many Iranians have reacted to a video posted on X on 12 August by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In it, he addressed Iranians in English, saying Israel will share water desalination technology with Iran as soon as Iran is ""free"", and calling on them to take risks for their future and hit the streets in protest.

""I stand with you, Israel stands with you, the entire world stands with you,"" he says in the video with Persian subtitles, concluding the address with a phrase ""Iran for Iranians"" in Persian.

A prominent anti-establishment user said Netanyahu's address implied that a ""resumption of clashes"" between Iran and Israel was expected in a very near future.

Another anti-establishment user claimed that Iran has suffered a defeat in propaganda war much worse than in the battle, as Netanyahu ""has turned himself into the most popular non-Iranian political figure among the Iranian people"".

Meanwhile, some pro-establishment users pointed to Israel's own drought problems.

One user, referring to Netanayhu's remarks on helping Iran with the water problem, published a photo of thirsty Palestinian children drinking water from a pipe, while hardliners used the chance to blame pro-reform President Massoud Pezeshkian for the water issues.

Prominent hardline conspiracy theorist Aliakbar Raefipour warned that the message meant Israel will now ""activate the internal and border unrest that they failed to provoke during the 12-day war"".

We have lost more than 10% of the generation that was available to us on 20 March. This is something that, most likely, cannot be restored quickly.

At the same time, according to the expert, the national energy operator Ukrenerho has securely protected its main networks, and has a reserve and equipment for restoration, while the worst situation is observed in coal power generation, with both protection and restoration.

""I don't see how coal power units can be restored,"" Kharchenko noted.

He added that the situation is complicated by the fact that one of the 1GW nuclear power units is undergoing emergency repairs.

According to Kharchenko, preparations for the next winter season require emergency measures and a quick response.

""If we do not at least partially compensate for the existing losses, then we will have a significant lack of generation capacities to cover winter consumption,"" the expert said.

NYTFEED020240313ek3d0058x,The Actress Who Looks Out for Denmark,"Hunting murderers, delivering babies or guarding inmates, Sofie Grabol plays women who try to keep their country safe.

If you watch much Danish television — and that is an option these days, wherever you happen to live — a question rises: How would Denmark function without Sofie Grabol?","In “The Killing” (“Forbrydelsen”), which put Danish TV on the map and made Grabol a star back in 2007, the country’s justice system was held together by her morose detective, Sarah Lund. In her two most recent series, Grabol expands her public-service portfolio. In “The Shift” she plays Ella, the head midwife at Copenhagen’s best public pediatric hospital. And in “Prisoner” she’s Miriam, a reform-minded guard at a prison threatened with closing. Whether she is catching Denmark’s murderers, delivering its babies or minding its inmates, Grabol is indispensable.

To follow Grabol’s progress through the Danish infrastructure, the American viewer will need the streaming service MHz Choice (free trials currently available), which carries “The Shift” (2022) and premiered “Prisoner” (2023) this week. The three seasons of “The Killing” are on the streamer Topic, which will merge with MHz Choice on April 1, consolidating this segment of Grabol’s catalog. (She also plays a public official in the eerie British series “Fortitude,” available on multiple streamers.)

The shows centered on Sarah, Ella and Miriam are quite different — “The Killing” is a lurid crime thriller, “The Shift,” a big-hearted medical soap opera, “Prisoner,” a grim social-problem drama — but the characters have much in common.

Each is aggrieved but indomitable, a working-class Sisyphus pushing ahead through institutional neglect and cowardice — a very squeaky wheel at work — while weighed down by personal trauma. Each is estranged from the only close family member still in her life; two become reluctant surrogate mothers to the women their troubled sons get pregnant. Perhaps Grabol has been typecast over the years, or has typecast herself. Or maybe the grouchy, standoffish, self-righteous pain in the butt is a character that resonates in Denmark.

Grabol is an economical actor, able to communicate a world of emotion through her liquid eyes and seemingly offhand movements. (She’s also blessed with a notably dramatic pair of eyebrows.) She makes all of these bottled-up, difficult women believable and, even when they push everyone away, sympathetic — you can see the layers of pain and weariness that they shelter behind and occasionally break through.

The shows share a sensibility with Grabol’s performances; they are unflashy, meticulously made, superior examples of their genres. (“The Killing” was a trendsetter in transferring the outré violence of 1990s movie murderers into TV, but it presented their offenses with a Nordic reserve.)

“The Shift” is a forthright hospital melodrama, and there’s even an amusing twist on “Grey’s Anatomy” in which Ella is followed around the hospital by her mother, an orderly who breaks into meetings to pester her daughter about her health and love life. The mostly female midwives serve the dramatic function that nurses often do in American stories, putting up with and bailing out the mostly male doctors. The show’s theme is the chronic understaffing of midwives in the public hospital, while its running motif is the staff’s obsession with food, from the critical attention paid to the pastries in the break room to the prescribing of toast and tea for all noncritical medical issues.

But in the hands of its creator and showrunner, the talented director Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), “The Shift” (the Danish title translates as “Day and Night”) has a winning sincerity and humor; it isn’t cloying, and it doesn’t traffic in bad outcomes to gin up emotion. Tricky story lines — a midwife who doubts herself when she’s gaslighted by a struggling doctor, another who sees her patients through the lens of her own history of abuse — are handled delicately. Ella fights for more midwives and finds herself pregnant at 46 (by a married doctor), but she’s chipper and funny, and Grabol gets to show a slightly softer side.

“Prisoner,” created by Kim Fupz Aakeson with Frederik Louis Hviid and Michael Noer and written by Aakeson (who, in the small world of Danish TV, wrote two episodes of “The Shift”), takes the critique of the country’s social welfare in a much darker direction. It is structured as a tragedy: Three guards at a failing prison all have fatal vulnerabilities — a secret love life, a junkie son with debts, a friendship with an inmate — that drag them down into a tense and cleverly worked-out spiral of lies and vengeance.

Grabol is primary in the ensemble of “The Shift,” but in “Prisoner” the attention is evenly split among her, Youssef Wayne Hvidtfeldt as the idealistic new guard Sammi and David Dencik as the compromised veteran Henrik. It’s largely Dencik’s show. Henrik, who vacillates between surly anger and puppy dog neediness, is the most interesting character, and Dencik (“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,” “Chernobyl”) is terrific.

The beat-downs, drug runs, racial animosities and inevitable spasm of group violence are all familiar, but in its six fairly tight episodes, “Prisoner” makes them credible and achieves a fair measure of the documentary-style grittiness it goes for. Grabol’s Miriam goes down some dark roads — she’s not the justice-obsessed grind of “The Killing” or the dedicated crusader of “The Shift” — but her heart is in the right place. Denmark is still lucky to have her."

During early voting in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) in the period 10-14 March, voting urns and screens were set up in the open air in cities across the region, First Republican reported. Voters were said to have come out in entire families and groups of co-workers - ""electricians, metallurgists, veterans and athletes"".

""For working people, this format was very convenient,"" Parafanova commented.

In Donetsk, a group of uniformed ""Donetsk Cossacks"" were among the first to vote collectively, a correspondent reported.

Their leader, Ataman Sergei Bumagin, said it was convenient for them to come and vote ""compactly and quickly"". ""We see our candidate as a strong leader,"" he added.

Another Cossack said they voted for ""our Russia, our future, our hopes and aspirations; we think we made the right decisions"".

Other voters said they voted for: ""stability""; ""the future, for our children, for us to have a peaceful sky at last""; ""for peace on earth, for freedom, for our children and grandchildren to live in free country"".

First Republican: 'Not even the threat of death stops our people'

""Terrible news"" was said to have shaken Donetsk at dawn on the first of the main voting days, 15 March, when three children were said to have been killed by Ukrainian shelling.

""Not even the threat of death stops our people,"" Parafanova insisted.

DPR leader Denis Pushilin was said to have been one of the first to vote on 15 March. ""It is the unchangingness of the path we have taken since 2014,"" he said afterwards. ""It is the awareness of the value of this choice we made and continue to make. That we are voting today is our absolute involvement in the future of our country. It gives confidence and internal euphoria.""

Other stories featured included:

- Pushilin visits ""liberated"" Avdiivka with the first deputy head of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sergei Kiriyenko; they meet some of the few remaining residents, who talk about the problems they face, including infrequent bread deliveries, and the lack of gas and fuel for generators; Kiriyenko assures them the administration is working on solving these problems: ""Don't worry, everything will be fine,"" he says.

Tavriya: 'Thank you, Russia, that we're with our family at last'

In a Novosti news bulletin at midnight local time on 17 March, presenter Pavel Miroshnichenko said that the final day of voting in Kherson Region passed ""without incidents and strictly in line with the law"".

In a report from Henichesk, a Tavriya correspondent noted that a ""gastronomic festival"" was held in the city centre right next to a polling station in the Moskva (formerly Ukrayina) cinema, making it ""virtually impossible"" to pass by without stopping. In addition, an orchestra was performing nearby. The polling station was said to be packed.

""I voted because I'm for Russia,"" a woman said. ""My son lives in Moscow.""

""I am very happy that it so happened that we will be living in a free country, where everything is done for people, for our children,"" another said. ""Thank you, Russia, that we're with our family at last.""

An election observer said everything was going ""smoothly and quietly"" and voters were ""in a good mood"".

International observers were also said to have found no violations.

""Judging by what I saw here, it was an absolutely transparent vote without pressure or propaganda,"" French observer Christian Ro said. ""In essence, it was what can be called ideal democracy. This is what real democracy should look like.""

In a report from Nizhny Syrohozy, a local resident said that everything was getting better compared to the way it was under Ukraine.

The leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), Leonid Pasechnik, said at a meeting with Italian observers that the Russian presidential election in the LPR was ""fair, open and without violations"", Luhansk 24 reported in a news bulletin on the evening of 17 March.

The Italians were said not to have observed violations at polling stations and to have praised the ""security, transparency and legality of the voting process"", as well as the presence of medics at polling stations.

One of the Italians, captioned as Donato Lorenzo Tilly, praised the care taken for elderly voters and people with disabilities, including provision of ballots in braille.

""In addition, the foreigners noted the active involvement of young people in voting, which they said was not typical for European youth,"" the presenter added. ""They said that there is a connection between generations, which gives hope of a bright future.""

Another observer, Giorgio Deschi, noted that this was his second visit to Donbas and that he previously observed the regional elections in 2023.

This time he saw the same ""calm atmosphere"" and ""accuracy, transparency and truth that I saw in September"".

""I saw people who were happy that they were part of a big family, and that they were electing a real leader,"" he said.

(Deschi is reported to be the founder of the separatist movement Liberazione Triestina.)

The international experts were said to have debunked Italian media reports that Donbas people were forced to vote at gunpoint, and to have said Donbas elections were more transparent and correct than in Italy.

Ukraine has started building dragon's teeth-type fortifications in Dnipropetrovsk Region, Dmytro Lykhoviy, the spokesman for the Tavriya operational strategic group of forces, has said on the national TV marathon.","The Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted him as saying on 8 March that there were pictures of those fortifications on the social media pages of the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, Serhiy Lysak.

Lykhoviy asked residents of Zaporizhzhya Region, which is south of Dnipropetrovsk Region, not to panic over the fact that a line of defence is being built behind them. ""There are never too many fortifications. The more of them, the better. Under these conditions, this is another reason why residents of rear cities and villages should sleep more peacefully,"" he said.

Speaking about the construction of fortifications in 2023, he said: ""Last year, the war was an offensive one for us. We were conducting an offensive operation. Everyone wanted a counter-offensive with subsequent results. Back then, our sapper and engineering units were involved in offensive actions, paving the way for our infantrymen through the fences and fortifications created by the enemy.""

Now Ukraine has switched to a defensive operation, including in the area of responsibility of the Tavriya operational strategic group of forces, he added.

BBCUKB0020240311ek3b001md,Ukraine stabilising front despite shortage of arms - Zelensky,"The Ukrainian military is stabilising the front, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. In his regular nightly address, he noted that this was being done despite a shortage of Western-supplied weapons. He further said that Ukraine was building 2,000 km of fortifications, expressing the hope that these and other efforts would thwart Vladimir Putin's ""sick plans"". The following is the text in English of Zelensky's address published on his official website on 11 March:

Dear Ukrainians!","Today, most of the day was devoted to military and war issues. First, the meeting of the Staff. Detailed reports on each direction of our frontline: from Kupyansk to Kherson Region. The Commander-in-Chief, the Chief of the General Staff, the commanders of the directions, the Ministry of Defence.

The troops are now stabilising our positions at the front. And they are doing so despite the fact that supplies from our partners remain significantly limited. I am grateful to every soldier and commander - to all our warriors who ensure our defence and our frontline operations with their strength and resilience. And I am grateful to every enterprise here in Ukraine and to all joint ventures with partners for the continuous increase in our own supplies, for the much-needed weapons for our independence: drones, shells, artillery, and vehicles.

There was also a report on the construction of fortifications. More than 2,000 kilometers of tasks, shoring up the existing fortifications and creating new ones - at least three lines of our strength. They are designed to meet the threats. All the necessary resources have been deployed. The government, regional leaders and the military are personally responsible for the result. The result should speak for itself, with its reliability for every soldier.

Today, Commander-in-Chief Syrskyy and Defence Minister Umerov made a separate report. They spoke about the current situation at the front and about planning our actions. There should be no place of rest for the occupier. Today we also discussed preparations for the next Ramstein meeting and the key points of our communication with partners regarding weapons and ammunition.

Chief of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine Budanov also delivered a separate report. Several issues were raised. First of all, Russia's military plans. Not only against our country, but also against other nations. The common task of the world now is to thwart this sick Putin's fantasy that he allegedly has time to continue the war. Perhaps he will intensify mobilisation after the imitation of ""elections"" now in March. Mobilisation of Russians. However, we must further limit the mobilisation of resources and finances, tightening the remnants of Russia's ties with the world even more severely. And everyone who values the lives of their people must do this - every leader. I am grateful to everyone who helps.

Today I held several meetings with government officials, the financial and economic block of our government and the National Bank, to discuss the state of our financial system. We ensure the stability and reliable operation of financial institutions. We also discussed this year's budget work. I am grateful to all entrepreneurs who work, pay taxes and preserve jobs.

This is the period of our maximum concentration, our maximum initiative to ensure that it is Ukraine that determines a just end to this war. We can endure. We have to win.

Glory to all who fight and work for the sake of Ukraine and Ukrainians! Glory to everyone in the world who upholds justice!

Glory to Ukraine!

NYTFEED020240328ek3s006pp,Trump’s Defense Team Argues First Amendment Prohibits Georgia Charges,"Fulton County prosecutors say Donald J. Trump’s comments about the 2020 election were meant to advance a broad criminal scheme to overturn the election results.

Donald J. Trump’s lead defense lawyer in Georgia argued in court on Thursday that the former president’s criminal indictment should be dismissed because it was based on comments that Mr. Trump had made about the 2020 presidential election that were protected by the First Amendment.","The lawyer, Steven H. Sadow, said that Mr. Trump’s comments, writings and internet posts after the November 2020 election amounted to political speech, which courts have considered sacrosanct under the First Amendment.

“Take out the political speech, no charges,” Mr. Sadow said at the hearing in a courtroom in downtown Atlanta.

Fulton County prosecutors pushed back, arguing that Mr. Trump’s statements were part of a broad conspiracy to illegally overturn his election loss. The scheme is outlined in a sweeping racketeering indictment that was handed up in August and that named Mr. Trump alongside 18 co-defendants. Four of the co-defendants have since pleaded guilty.

The argument that First Amendment grounds should block Mr. Trump from being prosecuted criminally for efforts to overturn the 2020 election results has previously been rejected by a U.S. District Court judge, Tanya Chutkan, in a separate federal prosecution that is unfolding in Washington, D.C.

Georgia prosecutors noted the earlier ruling in court on Thursday. They also argued that Mr. Trump’s comments should not be considered on their own, but as part of a series of actions aimed to advance crimes including racketeering.

Mr. Trump’s statements were “employed as part of the pattern of criminal conduct in numerous ways, so there’s nowhere to go,” said Donald Wakeford, a prosecutor in the Fulton County district attorney’s office.

Scott McAfee, the presiding judge in the case, did not make a ruling from the bench on Thursday.

The hearing was the first to take place since the Georgia case took a detour after defense lawyers asserted that Fulton County’s district attorney, Fani T. Willis, had created a conflict of interest when she engaged in a romantic relationship with Nathan J. Wade, a lawyer she hired to manage the prosecution team.

This month, Judge McAfee ruled that an “actual” conflict of interest did not exist but that “the appearance of impropriety” remained. To solve the problem, the judge gave Ms. Willis a choice: either Mr. Wade could step away from the case, or she and her entire office could do so. Mr. Wade resigned from his job as special prosecutor a few hours later.

Defense lawyers are seeking to appeal the judge’s ruling on the disqualification matter and reassert their argument that Ms. Willis and her office ought to be removed from the case. Judge McAfee has said that the issue merits review by the Georgia Court of Appeals. The appeals court itself must now decide whether to take the matter."

Together with our brothers in arms we have proved to the entire world that Putin is increasingly losing control of the situation with every day and is no longer capable of defending the borders of his own country. In a couple of days, Russian volunteers have liberated two settlements from the Putin regime. Putin's army has lost a huge amount of equipment and more than 1,000 troops, who in a panic were thrown to the slaughter under our guns. But as it turned out, even in a critical moment for their authorities - the days of the presidential election [14-17 March] - Putin's entire army was unable to resist us.""

They&#160;went&#160;on&#160;to&#160;say&#160;that&#160;the&#160;Kremlin&#160;was&#160;unable&#160;to&#160;hold&#160;the&#160;presidential&#160;election in Belgorod and Kursk regions ""under bombs and artillery fire"". ""Nobody in their right mind after all that could claim that Putin was elected legally.""

""Vladimir Putin has lost what&#160;remained of his legitimacy, power is slipping from his hands. He has less and less control over processes in&#160;Russia.&#160;Russians see it and more and more compatriots are joining our ranks. Soon we will move on to other towns,"" the statement said.

Representatives of the volunteer units told a press conference in the Ukrinform news agency in Kyiv on 21 March that the operation would continue.

""Stabilisation measures are being carried out,"" Freedom of Russia volunteer Alexei Baranovsky said. ""So our liberation operation on the territory of our homeland will continue.""

On 12 March, the three volunteer units said they had crossed the border and begun an operation aimed at ""freeing Russia from dictatorship"".&#160;

Gunmen attack Kurdish fighters in Deir al-Zour

A war monitor reported yesterday that clashes in Deir al-Zour province between pro-government fighters and Kurdish-led forces had left one dead and three wounded.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said gunmen had attacked the Syrian Democratic forces (SDF), seizing six fighters and later releasing two.

Syrian media have reported renewed clashes in northeast Syria between the SDF and pro-government forces.

This week, Turkey and Syria signed a military cooperation agreement under which Ankara will provide weapons and training for the Syrian army.

Turkey is one of Damascus's main allies since the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad.

It has threatened to take action against the SDF which controls large areas of north east Syria, unless the group integrates into Syria's army.

Palestinian factions call for 'national unity' meeting

Palestinian factions meeting in Cairo yesterday issued a joint statement in which they called on Egypt to sponsor and host an emergency national unity meeting of all Palestinian forces to discuss a ""national strategy and practical programme to confront the occupation's schemes"".

The statement condemned Israeli remarks on taking control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, calling on the international community to pressure Israel to halt its operations and hold it responsible for its ongoing ""violations"".

The factions stressed their ""full responsiveness to initiatives and proposals for a solution that meets national requirements, including an end to the aggression, the withdrawal of the occupying forces, and the lifting of the unjust blockade on Gaza"".

They also expressed appreciation for ""the great efforts"" made by the mediators - Egypt and Qatar - in supporting ""the Palestinian cause and halting the aggression"" against Palestinians.

New settlements will 'bury the idea of a Palestinian state' - Smotrich

The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said plans to build over 3,000 settlements in the occupied West Bank will ""bury the idea of a Palestinian state"", Israeli media reported yesterday.

The controversial ""E1"" plan, which has been on hold for decades, seeks to extend the settlement of Maale Adumim, cutting off occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank and separating the northern and eastern parts of the enclave.

The Maariv daily quoted Smotrich as saying after announcing the plan: ""This is Zionism at its best - building, setting and strengthening our sovereignty in the Land of Israel.""

Israeli media have reported that the government is expected to formally approve construction plans next week.

Smotrich's remarks draw backlash

Smotrich's remarks have provoked harsh criticism by Palestinian factions and some Arab countries.

Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, along with other groups, issued statements to denounce the move and called on international and regional powers to work to halt the plan.

Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan also officially criticised the plans, describing them as ""violation"" of international law.

The Palestinian presidency also said the plan undermined any chance to implement the two-state solution.

Israeli minister visits Marwan Barghouti

The far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited prominent Palestinian Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, currently serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison, domestic media reported yesterday.

In a video, the first published documentation of Barghouti (also Barghuthi) in years, Ben Gvir could be heard telling him: ""You won't win.""

""Whoever messes with the nation of Israel, whoever murders women and children, we will wipe them out,"" Ben Gvir added.

Barghouti appeared shaven-headed in the video, and domestic media later cited his family as saying they were ""shocked"" by his appearance, adding that he looked hungry.

The Haaretz daily said the release of such footage was ""very unusual"" and would usually require permission from the Prison Service.

Yemen minister criticises Houthi presence in Iraq's Karbala

A senior official from Yemen's internationally recognised government has said that the appearance of members of the Iran-backed Houthi movement in the Iraqi city of Karbala, to mark the end of the Arbaeen pilgrimage, revealed the group's ""alien agenda"".

In a statement yesterday, Information Minister Muammar al-Eryani made the remarks in response to photos and videos shared online purportedly showing members of the rebel group participating in the predominantly Shia pilgrimage.

The minister stressed that the government had ""warned from the outset that the Houthis were... an Iranian tool implementing a sectarian project"".

Anti-Houthi Suhail TV also criticised the footage, reporting that the Houthis had been distributing ""millions of free meals"" every day to pilgrims while ""stealing from the mouths of the hungry in Yemen"".

Lebanese army to present disarmament plan on 2 Sep

Other media outlets, including El Nashra, Nida al-Watan, Al-Markazia, L'Orient-Le Jour, widely picked up on her statements.

Zein, who is a member of Amal - a key Hezbollah ally - was one of several ministers to walk out from a cabinet session last week that approved a US proposal for the disarmament of Hezbollah and to consolidate an ongoing ceasefire with Israel.

The details of the plan are ""worrying and every clause contains a trap,"" she further told Al-Jadeed.

Tunisia union threatens general strike in standoff with president

On 7 August, protesters rallied outside the UGTT headquarters in Tunis, chanting ""mafia"" and ""corruption"". The union said some tried to storm the building in a ""planned attack"".

In a later video address, the president backed the protesters, saying they had no intention of violence.

NYTFEED020240321ek3l007bx,Ireland’s Prime Minister Stepped Down. So What Happens Now?,"Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland, resigned unexpectedly, prompting a political scramble. Here’s what to know about what happens next.

The leader of the Republic of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, resigned on Wednesday, prompting a political scramble in the government after his announcement in front of the parliament building in Dublin.","Mr. Varadkar’s decision, which he attributed to both “personal and political” reasons, was unexpected, with some members of his government given only a few hours’ notice of his plans.

A medical doctor and former health minister, Mr. Varadkar first became taoiseach, or prime minister, in 2017, at a time when his Fine Gael party was still one of the country’s two dominant parties, a position it had enjoyed nearly uninterrupted since the founding of the Irish state.

During his years in office, though, public opinion shifted, and as Fine Gael’s popularity dipped, his departure seemed inevitable, experts said. Now, as Ireland grapples with what comes next for its government, here’s what to know.

Who might be Ireland’s next leader?

Despite calls from the opposition for a general election, Mr. Varadkar’s resignation does not mean an end to the current government.

Fine Gael, a center-right party, currently governs in coalition with two other parties, Fianna Fáil, its longtime rival, and the Green Party. Under the terms of their power-sharing arrangement, it is up to Fine Gael to appoint a new leader, who will then become the prime minister.

Because of the surprise nature of Mr. Varadkar’s announcement, there was no immediate successor waiting in the wings, leading to an initial rush of speculation about who might fill his position.

By Thursday evening, though, it appeared that Simon Harris, the minister for education, might be vying for the role uncontested. For years he has spoken of his desire to one day lead the party, and on Thursday evening he confirmed to the national broadcaster RTÉ, “I want to be the next leader of Fine Gael,” adding, “If given the opportunity, I will give this my all.”

Mr. Harris, who is 37, will become the youngest-ever taoiseach if he does become the party’s leader, edging out Mr. Varadkar, who initially took up the leadership role at 38. So far, it appears that other members of the party are rallying around him.

Other potential contenders included party stalwarts like Paschal Donohoe, the minister for public expenditure and reform, and Heather Humphreys, the minister for social protection. Both are longtime Fine Gael lawmakers, but in the past 24 hours both have said they have no intention of putting themselves forward.

How long until the new leader is announced?

In his resignation speech, Mr. Varadkar laid out an aspirational timeline for Fine Gael to appoint a new leader, saying that he wanted a successor to be elected before the party’s annual conference on April 6. That person would then become prime minister when parliament resumed on April 9, after an Easter break.

The process to get there, though, could become complicated if more than one lawmaker contests the election.

One reason for the urgency to choose a new leader is that Ireland will hold local and European elections in June.

In addition, Ireland’s Dáil, the popularly elected lower house of parliament, has a maximum term of five years, so a national election must be held before March 22, 2025. That means that whoever replaces Mr. Varadkar will serve as taoiseach for less than a year before an election is called.

What does this mean for Irish politics?

Mr. Varadkar, the young, gay son of an Irish mother and an Indian father, once seemed like an emblem of a new, more energetic and inclusive Ireland. Now, he is the face of an increasingly unpopular establishment.

His resignation follows years of waning support for the long-dominant parties, Fine Gael, which dropped to the third most popular in the country’s last general election in 2020, and Fianna Fáil. It crystallizes the perception that Irish politics is in a moment of flux and uncertainty.

Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, once the political branch of the I.R.A., rose from its position as a fringe player to win the most votes in the last election. No party came close to a majority, forcing the formation of a coalition.

All of the major parties are fighting political headwinds, as Ireland faces a number of domestic challenges. A severe housing shortage — caused partly by the failure of successive governments to invest in affordable housing — and a cost-of-living crisis have created widespread frustration with the political establishment.

With the number of asylum seekers arriving in the country rising sharply, the government has had to contend with an anti-immigration backlash driven in part by far-right rhetoric online. That has increasingly spilled over into violence, with arsonists targeting planned housing for asylum seekers and a violent riot in Dublin late last year that drew international attention.

Concerns about immigration seem to be benefiting independent candidates. Even Sinn Féin, still the most popular party in the polls, has seen its support fall. And with a general election on the horizon, the country’s leading politicians must now grapple with how to address a deeply divisive issue without inflaming it further."

Today, I submitted a list of our Ukrainian citizens, including Crimean Tatars, who have been repressed by Russia in Ukraine's occupied territories and are being held in Russian prisons and camps under extremely harsh and inhumane conditions. We must release them all, both warriors and civilians,"" he said.

The parties discussed the implementation of Kyiv's Peace Formula and preparations for a Global Peace Summit due to be held in Switzerland.

Zelensky stressed that Russian representatives cannot participate in the summit: ""We do not see how it is possible to invite people who are blocking, destroying and killing everything. We want to achieve a result, a just peace for Ukraine. Therefore, first, civilised countries of the world will develop a detailed plan and have results, and only then will they involve representatives of Russia, those who are ready for a just peace.""

The presidents also discussed food security and ways to ensure stability in the Black Sea region.

Zelensky met representatives of Turkish defence companies, noting that agreements on joint defence projects have been reached both at the government level and between companies.

""We are prepared to move quickly to put everything we discussed into action. I am very satisfied with the discussions with defence companies,"" he told reporters.

According to him, ""Ukraine is prepared to quickly resolve issues regarding economic cooperation with Turkiye, particularly the reconstruction of our country and advancing bilateral agreements"".

""Ukraine and Turkiye are strengthening each other and our entire region,"" Zelensky said.

In the presence of the two presidents, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat signed an agreement on the establishment of a preliminary information electronic exchange system between customs authorities of the two states, the website reported. The document is expected to accelerate the movement of goods and vehicles across the borders of both states while reducing the number of violations.

NYTFEED020240330ek3u0008e,"A Stork, a Fisherman and Their Unlikely Bond Enchant Turkey","Thirteen years ago, a poor fisherman in a small Turkish village was retrieving his net from a lake when he heard a noise behind him and turned to find a majestic being standing on the bow of his rowboat.

Gleaming white feathers covered its head, neck and chest, yielding to black plumes on its wings. It stood atop skinny orange legs that nearly matched the color of its long, pointy beak.","The fisherman, Adem Yilmaz, recognized it as one of the white storks that had long summered in the village, he recalled, but he had never seen one so close, much less hosted one on his boat.

Wondering if it was hungry, he tossed it a fish, which the bird devoured. He tossed another. And another.

So began an unlikely tale of man and bird that has captivated Turkey as the passing years — and a deft social media campaign by a local nature photographer — have spread the pair’s story as a modern-day fable of cross-species friendship.

The stork, nicknamed Yaren, or “companion,” in Turkish, not only returned to Mr. Yilmaz’s boat repeatedly that first year, the fisherman said, but after migrating south for the winter, returned the next spring to the same village, the same nest — and the same boat.

Last month, after Yaren appeared in the village for the 13th year in a row, the local news media gleefully covered his arrival like the springtime sighting of a Turkish Punxsutawney Phil.

The pair’s story has brought unexpected fame, although no serious fortune, to Mr. Yilmaz, 70, and Yaren, estimated to be 17. They have co-starred in a children’s book and an award-winning documentary. A children’s adventure movie featuring a cameo by Mr. Yilmaz (and a digital rendering of the stork) is expected to debut in cinemas across Turkey this year.

Stork lovers everywhere can watch Yaren and his partner, Nazli, or “coquette” in Turkish, as they preen, contort their necks, clack their beaks, renovate their nest and occasionally mate, thanks to a 24-hour webcam set up by the local government.

“This is not a tale. This is a true story,” Ali Ozkan, the mayor of Karacabey, whose district includes the village, said in an interview. “It is a true story with the flavor of a tale.”

The bird’s celebrity has bolstered municipal efforts to increase local tourism with walking paths and coffee shops near the district’s lakes and wetlands, he said. The area has developed a stork “master plan” to care for the birds.

He initially faced some criticism from constituents who wondered why a mayor was getting involved with storks, he said. But now, residents call in when they notice damaged nests, and a friend from another city recently phoned him to complain that he could not see Yaren on the webcam.

The story has put Mr. Yilmaz’s village of Eskikaraagac — population 235 — on the map, drawing groups of students and tourists who stroll its narrow streets to see the storks and take boat rides on neighboring Lake Uluabat. Many visitors seek out Yaren’s nest, which sits on a platform atop an electric pole near Mr. Yilmaz’s house, and act star-struck when they encounter the fisherman himself, peppering him with questions and posing for photographs.

One recent morning, Mr. Yilmaz stood in the yard of his small, two-story house holding a tub of fish he had caught. In their nest overhead, Yaren and Nazli dozed, groomed themselves and filled the air with the percussive clacking of their beaks.

“Yaren!” Mr. Yilmaz called.

Both birds glided down to the yard, and Mr. Yilmaz lofted fish into their beaks.

“They are full,” Mr. Yilmaz announced after the birds had downed about two dozen fish. “After 13 years, I can tell.”

Storks have long nested in the village, arriving in the spring and mating before migrating in the late summer toward Africa.

Village elders recall when there seemed to be a stork nest on every roof and residents struggled to prevent the birds from swiping laundry from outdoor lines. But most people liked the birds, whose arrival right after pink flowers bloomed on the almond trees was a harbinger of spring.

Ridvan Cetin, the village’s elected authority, said a count in the 1980s found 41 active nests, meaning 82 storks, not including chicks.

This year, the village has only four active nests, including Yaren’s.

“Now they are very few,” Mr. Cetin said sadly.

No one in the village could recall a bond similar to that between Mr. Yilmaz and Yaren.

“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Mr. Cetin said.

For Mr. Yilmaz, a quiet man with leathery hands and a kind, rutted face, Yaren was a serendipitous addition to what he had hoped would be a late, restful chapter in an otherwise difficult life.

He grew up poor. His father pulled him out of school to work in the fields and fish, no matter how cold the weather.

“My life was between the field and the lake,” he said.

His mother died when he was 13. His father remarried when he was 17 to a woman Mr. Yilmaz did not like. So, with only an elementary school education, he fled to Bursa, the nearest big city, and worked in a factory that made yogurt and other milk products.

At 19, he married another villager he had known since childhood. They lost their first child, a daughter, weeks after her birth. He worked in different milk factories as he and his wife raised three other children, two boys and a girl.

In 2011, with his children grown and living elsewhere with his five grandchildren, he stopped working, returned to the village and moved back into his childhood home, next to the lake where he had fished as a child.

“It was my dream from the day I started working to go to my village and fish,” he said.

Soon after, the stork landed on his boat.

Each time Yaren left, Mr. Yilmaz wondered whether he would return. But after a few years, he stopped worrying.

“I was sure that as long as I was alive, this bird was going to return,” he said.

Early on, no one much cared that Mr. Yilmaz had made friends with a stork. Other villagers teased him or said he was wasting his time — and his fish.

That changed in year five, when Alper Tuydes, a hunter turned wildlife photographer who works for the local government, began sharing photographs of the pair on social media. The story spread, getting a lift each spring with Yaren’s arrival.

The relationship of man and bird corresponds with known stork behaviors, said Omer Donduren, a Turkish ornithologist.

Although storks avoid direct contact with people, they often roost near them, on roofs, in chimneys or atop electricity poles.

The birds tend toward monogamy and display loyalty to their nests, parting ways with their partners to migrate, but rendezvousing in the same nest in the spring to reproduce.

That could explain why Yaren has roosted near Mr. Yilmaz’s house year after year, Mr. Donduren said.

Storks, which can live for more than 20 years in the wild and more than 30 in captivity, also have strong memories, enabling them to remember migration routes from as far north as Poland and Germany to destinations many thousands of miles south, as far as South Africa. It is unclear where Yaren spends his time after he leaves the village, but a tracker affixed to one of his offspring followed the bird over Syria, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic before it stopped working.

Over time, Yaren’s experiences with Mr. Yilmaz have probably become part of his memory, he said.

“Nature doesn’t have much space for emotions,” Mr. Donduren said. “For the stork, it is a matter of easy food. It thinks, There is an easy source of food here. This man seems safe. He doesn’t hurt me.”

Mr. Yilmaz’s explanation is much simpler.

“It is just to love an animal,” he said. “They are God’s creatures.”

One recent morning, Mr. Yilmaz rowed into the lake and pulled up his net, dropping small fish into the boat.

“Yaren!” he called.

The stork took flight, did a loop to surveil the boat and perched on a lamppost near the bank.

“Yaren!” Mr. Yilmaz called again.

The bird took flight again, finally alighting on the boat, where Mr. Yilmaz tossed him fish after fish.

After a while, the stork lifted off, glided around the village and returned to his nest.

“That’s it,” Mr. Yilmaz said with a satisfied smile. “He is full.”"
NYTFEED020240314ek3e001mk,Russia’s 2024 Presidential Vote: What to Know,"* Why does this vote matter?

* Does Putin face any serious challengers?","* Will the Kremlin manipulate the results?

* Can Russians protest?

* Can Putin remain president for life?

* When will the results be known?

* Where can I find more information?

Why does this vote matter?

The presidential vote in Russia, which began Friday and lasts through Sunday, features the trappings of a horse race but is more of a predetermined, Soviet-style referendum.

President Vladimir V. Putin, 71, will undoubtedly win a fifth term, with none of the three other candidates who are permitted on the ballot presenting a real challenge. The main opposition figure who worked to spoil the vote, Aleksei A. Navalny, a harsh critic of Mr. Putin and the Ukraine war, died in an Arctic prison last month.

Still, the vote is significant for Mr. Putin as a way to cement his legitimacy and refurbish his preferred image as the embodiment of security and stability. That image was tarnished when the war, advertised as a speedy operation to topple the government in Kyiv, turned into a slog that caused hundreds of thousands of casualties, ruptured relations with the West and ushered in harsher domestic repression.

“The Kremlin needs to demonstrate huge popular support, and that this support has increased since the beginning of the war,” said Nikolay Petrov, a Russian political scientist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.

Does Putin face any serious challengers?

The Kremlin habitually ensures that Mr. Putin faces no real competition. The other candidates — all members of the State Duma, Russia’s rubber-stamp Parliament — voted for the war in Ukraine, for increased censorship and for laws curbing gay rights.

Nikolai Kharitonov, 75, of the Communist Party, already lost badly to Mr. Putin in 2004.

Leonid Slutsky, 56 of the Liberal Democratic Party, a nationalist group loyal to Mr. Putin, has said he will not rally voters against the president.

Vladislav A. Davankov, 40, from the New People Party, is nominally liberal and has called for “peace” in Ukraine but has basically supported Mr. Putin.

Two candidates opposed to the war were disqualified. A veteran politician, Boris Nadezhdin, alarmed the Putin administration when tens of thousands of people across Russia lined up to sign petitions required for him to run. The Kremlin invalidated enough signatures to bar him.

Will the Kremlin manipulate the results?

Russia held real elections for about a decade after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Ever since, the Kremlin has relied on various social, geographic and technical levers to ensure that its candidate receives an overwhelming majority.

Although Mr. Putin enjoys some support, the Kremlin has long sought to proclaim that he received more than 50 percent support in balloting, and also more support than he did in each previous vote. This year that means outstripping the 56 million votes that the authorities said he received in 2018; pundits are betting on 60 million.

Two important changes this time could add to the vote’s opacity.

For one, balloting will be held in the so-called “new territories,” the four Ukrainian regions Moscow annexed without fully controlling them. Russia’s election officials say the area has 4.5 million voters, an assertion virtually impossible to monitor amid a war.

“We cannot check the figures there and the authorities will use them as they wish,” said Alexander V. Kynev, an independent election expert in Moscow.

Also, the ability to vote online will be more widely available, with electronic voters in 29 regions on one huge list, with no means to check where or how they voted, Mr. Kynev noted.

In a sprawling, diverse country like Russia, the Kremlin can also use more traditional means. Regions dominated by ethnic strongmen, like the Caucasus, habitually report huge turnouts with Mr. Putin receiving 99 percent of the vote — even if relatively few people show up at polling stations.

Areas where state industries prevail also tend to report heavy support for the president. To turn out the vote, some polling stations hold raffles for prizes like household appliances or firewood. One Siberian region is offering 16,000 prizes.

But the Kremlin must rely on some votes in big cities, and that can get tricky. Excessive manipulation has created unrest previously. There might be slightly more manipulation this year because monitors are barred unless issued credentials by the candidates.

Can Russians protest?

With street demonstrations banned, some Putin opponents hope to cast protest votes. The simplest method to lower his tally is to vote for someone else, experts noted.

“Noon Against Putin,” a campaign pushed by Mr. Navalny’s organization, suggests swarming polling places at midday on Sunday. But there are a number of hurdles, including possible confrontations with the police.

Also, in previous votes, few polling stations had more than 3,000 registered voters and many had fewer than 1,000. “It is technically very complicated to create a crowd,” said David Kankiia, an analyst with the Golos election watchdog, barred in Russia.

Can Putin remain president for life?

Since he was first appointed successor to President Boris Yeltsin in 2000, Mr. Putin has said Russia’s Constitution would dictate the length of his tenure. Then he kept rewriting the Constitution.

Asked in 2014 whether he would remain president forever, Mr. Putin responded, “This is not good and it is detrimental for the country and I do not need it either,” before adding, “We will see what the situation will be like, but in any case the term of my work is restricted by the Constitution.”

In 2008, when term limits forced him to step aside, he became prime minister under President Dmitri A. Medvedev, although Mr. Putin remained the power behind the throne until reclaiming the top job in 2012.

Presidential terms were extended to six years before the 2018 vote, and then in 2020 Mr. Putin changed the constitution again to reset his term clock. At this point, he can have at least two terms until 2036. If Mr. Putin lasts, he will soon outstrip the record, 29-year rule of Joseph Stalin.

When will the voting results be known?

The tally is expected to be announced sometime Sunday night Moscow time.

Where can I find more information?

Three men who had escaped from a prison in Grenada and were accused of hijacking an American couple’s yacht to flee have been charged with their murder, the police said on Thursday.","The couple, Ralph Hendry, 66, and Kathy Brandel, 71, went missing while sailing off the coast of Grenada. They had been spending the winter cruising in the Caribbean in their catamaran called Simplicity, which was found abandoned in neighboring St. Vincent and the Grenadines on Feb. 21.

There was no indication in the latest police statement that the bodies of the couple had been recovered as of Thursday.

Trevon Robertson, 23; Atiba Stanisclaus, 25; and Ron Mitchell, 30, face two counts of “capital murder by intentionally causing the death of Ralph Hendry and Kathleen Brandel,” the Royal Grenada Police Force said.

The authorities from police forces in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have given different ages and name spellings for the escapees.

The men were also charged with escaping lawful custody, housebreaking, robbery and two counts of kidnapping; Mr. Stanisclaus is also facing a rape charge, the police said, but no details were offered on those accusations. The three men made their first court appearance on Thursday, and are due back on March 27. The Royal Grenada Police Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The police had said in a statement released on Feb. 22 that three men who escaped from a prison in Grenada on Feb. 18 and made their way to St. Vincent using a yacht that had been docked in the St. George area of Grenada.

The prisoners were recaptured on Feb. 21, the same day that the couple’s yacht was found. At the time, the police said they were “currently working on leads that suggest that the two occupants of the yacht may have been killed in the process.”

At a news conference on Feb. 26, Commissioner Don McKenzie of the Royal Grenada Police Force that “information suggests that, while traveling between Grenada and St. Vincent, they disposed of the occupants.”

During a Feb. 26 news conference, Junior Simmons, superintendent of the Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force, said the joint investigation into the disappearance with Grenada police was ongoing, and he said the couple was presumed dead.

The investigation revealed that while sailing from Grenada, “the suspects committed several criminal acts including bodily harm to the couple,” he said.

The couple, who were married for 27 years, were “veteran cruisers,” according to the Salty Dawg Sailing Association, a nonprofit that brings together a community of sailors engaged in long-distance cruising on their boats. The couple were longtime members, the organization said in a statement, and “they both contributed to building the S.D.S.A.”

In a joint family statement posted on the association’s website on Feb. 27, Nick Buro, the son of Ms. Brandel, and Bryan Hendry, the son of Mr. Hendry, said that “if we have learned anything from this tragic event, it’s that we know they left this world in a better place than it was before they were born.”

“Ralph and Kathy lived a life that most of us can only dream of,” the message said. “Sailing the eastern coast of the United States, living on their home Simplicity, making friends with everyone they encountered, singing, dancing and laughing with friends and family — that’s who Ralph and Kathy were and that’s how they will be remembered in our hearts.”"

Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, lined up with voters outside the Russian embassy in Berlin on Sunday, in one of her few public appearances since her husband’s death last month.","Ms. Navalnaya has vowed to carry on her husband’s work.

Putin to show up at the polls on Sunday at noon local time.

Ms. Navalnaya declined to comment to reporters while standing in the mile-long line, flanked by her husband’s longtime spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh. But she hugged and took photographs with supporters who approached her, some of them in tears.

After about six hours of waiting, Ms. Navalnaya emerged from the Russian Embassy. She told reporters that she had written in “Navalny” on her ballot.

By 1 p.m., the line of voters stretched for nearly a mile through central Berlin, ending just past a sign marking the location of Hitler’s World War II bunker. Several people waiting to cast ballots said they planned to vote for anyone other than Mr. Putin — even though the alternatives were Kremlin-approved candidates — or to write in Mr. Navalny’s name.

Yulia Lozovskaya, 29, who moved to Germany from St. Petersburg after Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, was one of many who sought out Ms. Navalnaya after learning on social media that she was standing somewhere in the line.

“You feel you’re not alone,” Ms. Lozovskaya said, referring to the size of the crowd. “And that gives enormous strength.”"

Qatar says awaiting Israeli response to ceasefire proposal","The spokesperson for the Qatari foreign ministry, Majid al-Ansari, said yesterday that mediators have been waiting for an official Israeli response to the latest proposal accepted by Hamas.

The official Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported Ansari as saying in the ministry's weekly briefing that ""this proposal represents the best possible option"".

He noted that ""there was no specific timeframe"" for receiving an Israeli response, but hoped ""the response [would] be quick and positive"".

""The new proposal includes a track to reach a comprehensive deal to end the war, and also includes a temporary ceasefire for 60 days,"" Ansari added.

The spokesman praised Hamas's response as ""extremely positive, and consistent to a great extent with what had been previously approved by the Israeli side"".

We will file a briefing.

Israeli weighing response to Gaza proposal

Israeli media reported this morning that the Israeli government was still deciding whether to accept the partial ceasefire and hostage release deal.

The right-wing Channel 14's political correspondent Tamir Morag cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that ""Israel will not compromise on a partial deal.""

Morag added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed ""eager to launch the military move and is pressing the IDF to bring forward the timetable"".

The liberal daily Haaretz reported that the partial deals ""were born because of Netanyahu"", and added that Hamas's position since early 2024 has been that any deal must include the release of all hostages in exchange for ending the war.

Netanyahu, it said, had resisted this approach and the idea of a ""'humanitarian deal"" was born in Washington"".

Haaretz saw President Trump's support for Netanyahu as the main obstacle to securing a deal, and speculated on how Trump might react having previously backed Netanyahu's insistence that only ""the elimination of Hamas will free the hostages"".

Syrian and Israeli officials meet in Paris

Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani met an Israeli delegation in Paris yesterday, Syrian media reported.

Syrian state news agency Sana reported yesterday that the meeting had focused on ""several issues related to supporting stability in the region and southern Syria"".

The report said that the meeting had been held with US mediation as part of diplomatic efforts to ""enhance security and preserve its unity and territorial integrity"".

Meanwhile, Istanbul-based Syria TV highlighted a meeting between US Special Envoy Thomas Barrack and the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, Mowafaq Tarif, in Paris yesterday.

The cleric posted on his Facebook page that he and Barak had discussed ""issues related to Suweida"", where deadly clashes have occurred in recent weeks between Druze and Sunni tribal forces.

Syrian state news agency reboots

The Syrian state news agency Sana has relaunched this morning with a ""new look"".

The agency, which was a key source of government news under the Assad government, has undergone ""a comprehensive restructure"" to renew infrastructure, ""recruiting new talent and adopting a digital transformation plan"", according to the state-run Al-Ikbariyah al-Suriyah TV channel.

According to Sana's director general, the news agency will be opening bureaux abroad and providing content in a number of foreign languages, including English, French, Spanish, Turkish and Kurdish.

The site appears to have ceased publishing news in Hebrew, Russian and Farsi. There did not appear to be new content overnight.

Sana continues to maintain a presence on various social media.

Lebanese PM meets Jordanian king

Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam met Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman yesterday, where talks focused on bilateral relations, regional security, and reforms in Lebanon.

Lebanese state-run NNA reported that during the meeting Salam described Lebanese-Jordanian ties as ""strategic"" and thanked Amman for its ""continued support, particularly for the Lebanese army and in international forums"".

He also briefed the king on government efforts to ""reactivate state institutions through reforms and strengthen security, sovereignty and stability"". He has been actively pushing for the handing over of Hezbollah weaponry to the Lebanese military.

Salam condemned Israeli actions in Gaza and Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks on ""Greater Israel"", calling them a ""direct threat to Arab national security"".

He referred to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which calls for normalisation and an Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories, and insisted that Syria should retain its territorial integrity.

Maronite patriarch condemns Hezbollah

Lebanon's Maronite Catholic patriarch, Cardinal Beshara Boutros al-Rahi harshly criticised Hezbollah, accusing the group of ""emptying the resistance of its true meaning"" and subordinating Lebanon to Iran.

In an interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya yesterday, Rahi (also Ra'i) said: ""The Shia community are tired of war and want to live in peace,"" stressing that ""there is firm Lebanese consensus on implementing the decision to disarm Hezbollah"".

He dismissed Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem's recent remarks as ""escalatory rhetoric"" and insisted ""there will be no civil war in Lebanon.""

He added that the Lebanese army ""protects all Lebanese without distinction"" and urged Hezbollah to embrace its ""Lebaneseness.""

He described Iranian influence as ""flagrant interference"" and added that ""supporting Gaza's war has brought ruin to Lebanon"".

Coming up

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi travels to Moscow for talks with counterpart Sergei Lavrov.

The ministers will discuss cooperation in trade, economy, culture and humanitarian affairs, as well as the latest developments in the Middle East.

It is expected that a landmark agreement on visa-free travel for the citizens of both countries will be signed during the meeting."

NYTFEED020240308ek38000ma,"Brian Jack, a Trump Adviser, Will Run for Congress in Georgia","Mr. Jack, the final White House political director under President Donald J. Trump, will run for an open seat in a deeply conservative district with Mr. Trump’s backing.

Brian Jack, a political adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, filed paperwork on Thursday to run for Congress in Georgia, aiming to replace a retiring Republican representative in a deeply conservative district.","Mr. Jack, who was the final White House political director under Mr. Trump and has remained an adviser to the former president, will run to succeed Representative Drew Ferguson in Georgia’s Third Congressional District, which includes the southern suburbs of Atlanta. Mr. Ferguson, a four-term Republican, announced his retirement late last year.

Mr. Trump gave his “complete and total” endorsement to Mr. Jack’s candidacy in a social media post on Thursday afternoon.

“I encourage Brian, a Fayette County native, to go for it, pursue his dream, and run for Congress,” Mr. Trump wrote. “He represents a new generation of leadership, and he will be a GREAT congressman.”

In a statement, Mr. Jack, who was also an adviser to Representative Kevin McCarthy when he was the speaker of the House, said that with Mr. Trump’s endorsement “comes great responsibility.” He added: “I will tirelessly work to earn the trust and support of my home district.”

The endorsement, as well as Mr. Jack’s larger relationship with Mr. Trump, will most likely give him a significant advantage in the race’s Republican primary, on May 21.

At least six other Republican candidates have entered the race, including Mike Crane and Mike Dugan, both former state senators, and Philip Singleton, a former state representative. Those candidates could draw the ire of Mr. Trump, who has a history of holding grudges and has tightened his grip over the Republican Party.

If Mr. Jack advances out of the primary, he will practically be assured a victory in the general election in November. Mr. Ferguson defeated his Democratic opponent in the deep-red district by more than 36 points in 2022."
NYTFEED020240316ek3g001md,"In Occupied Ukraine, Casting a Vote (for Putin) as Armed Soldiers Watch","Russia is holding a presidential vote in the occupied regions of Ukraine to try to legitimize its rule there, expose dissenters and present a veneer of democracy.

A new sign went up a few miles from the front line recently on the main billboard of an occupied town in Ukraine’s Luhansk region.","“Vote for our president. Together we’re strong,” read the sign in the white, blue and red colors of the Russian flag, according to Anastasiia, a resident.

The message was clear to her: that the president was Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, not Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and that Mr. Putin was the only choice in the Russian presidential vote taking place in the occupied parts of Ukraine over the past three weeks.

Mr. Putin long ago transformed Russian elections into a predictable ritual meant to convey legitimacy to his rule. In the occupied territories, this practice has the additional goals of presenting the occupation as a fait accompli and identifying dissenters, said political analysts and Ukrainian officials.

“Elections in these regions fix the idea that they have the same laws and procedures as the rest of the country,” said Ilya Grashchenkov, a Russian political scientist who is advising a long-shot candidate running against Mr. Putin. That has the effect, he said, of weaving them into the fabric of Russian statehood.

For many in the occupied territories, the electoral ritual is unfolding under the watchful eyes of armed soldiers.

Wearing face coverings, the soldiers have accompanied poll workers door-to-door throughout the occupied parts of the four Ukrainian regions that Russia has annexed after invading the country two years ago, according to local residents, statements by Russian officials and videos posted on social media.

Occupation officials say the show of force is necessary to protect those collecting votes.

The poll workers are soliciting votes that are set to give Mr. Putin, who has no serious challenger on the ballot, his fifth term as president and another six years in office.

Ukrainian officials, Western allies and rights groups have called the elections an illegal sham. They say the vote is marred by widespread intimidation and coercion and is part of a wider campaign of repression against the residents of the occupied regions.

“They promote it, even though it’s not a real election,” said Anastasiia, the Luhansk region resident. “Everybody knows who will win.”

Anastasiia, 19, left the occupied territories this month to build her life away from the war zone. Citing fear of retribution, she asked to be identified by her first name only and to omit the name of her town to protect relatives who remained behind.

Few countries, if any, are expected to recognize the election results in the occupied regions, which include the Crimea peninsula, annexed in 2014 after Russia’s earlier aggression in southeastern Ukraine. The United Nations considers all of the territory to be part of Ukraine.

Analysts say the coercion, the numerous electoral machinations and the exodus of pro-Ukrainian residents mean that Mr. Putin is almost certain to obtain an even larger landslide in the occupied regions than in the rest of Russia.

For the Kremlin, it is the electoral process itself, rather than the margin of victory, that furthers its cause.

Conducting elections, no matter how orchestrated and unfair, in the occupied regions allows Mr. Putin to solidify his claim to them. It also allows him to portray himself as a champion of democracy and draw contrast with Ukraine, which suspended its presidential voting this year because of the war, said Mr. Grashchenkov, the political analyst.

Russia has already conducted two previous elections in the four regions of eastern and southern Ukraine that it has partly occupied since invading the country. The Kremlin claimed that 99 percent of the residents of Donetsk, the most populous of the occupied regions, chose to join Russia in 2022. Mr. Putin’s party candidates won a landslide victory in local voting held across the occupied territories last year.

Ukraine and Western nations have called those elections shams.

Apart from such votes, Russia has stamped out Ukrainian identity and language with Russian curriculums in schools, required Russian passports for employment and cracked down on people with pro-Ukrainian political views.

Russia’s attempts to replicate a normal election process often clash with the realities of war, sometimes in farcical ways.

For starters, Russia does not completely control the regions where it is purporting to conduct voting. And just months after it held a sham referendum as a way of proclaiming that the city of Kherson was part of Russia, its forces had to abandon the city to the Ukrainian army. (Russia remains in control of the southern portion of Kherson province.)

A similar dissonance emerged as this month’s rubber-stamp presidential balloting approached.

Little is known, for example, about how many voters there are. The constant shifting of the front lines, the flight of the local residents and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers and workers have dramatically transformed the demographics of the occupied regions. The full effect of this transformation remains largely unknown, because of strict Russian censorship and the ongoing fighting.

But the few available estimates point to a drastic decrease in the occupied population. Figures from Russia’s electoral commission show that the occupied part of the Kherson region, for example, lost 13 percent of its registered voters, or 75,000 adults, in the last three months of last year.

Overall, Russia’s electoral body claims the four Ukrainian regions that were annexed in 2022 have 4.5 million voters. This would represent a 33 percent drop from the last voter roll published by the Ukrainian government before the full-scale invasion. Ukrainian officials say the real number today is likely to be even lower.

The picture is complicated further by the Russian government’s decision to allow hundreds of thousands of soldiers stationed in the occupied territories to vote there. Russian propaganda videos published on social media have shown electoral workers dodging shells and diving into ditches to deliver ballot boxes to stoic soldiers in the trenches.

Russian authorities have not published the locations of the polling stations or the names of the members of the local electoral commissions. It has also leveraged the system to the state’s advantage.

Occupation officials have designated the occupied territories as “remote,” a label previously reserved for places like the reindeer herder communities in the Arctic. This has allowed Russia to extend the voting period there for three weeks, making the process even harder to monitor. Polls in two of the occupied regions, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, opened on Feb. 25 and will close on March. 17, when voting ends in Russia.

The “remote” designation has also allowed pro-Russian electoral officials to go door-to-door soliciting votes from residents of the occupied regions. And because voting there is taking place under martial law, these officials are accompanied by armed soldiers.

“Dear voters, we care about your safety!” the electoral commission for the occupied Zaporizhzhia wrote in a Telegram post this month, which showed camouflaged voters with blurred faces casting ballots. “You don’t need to go anywhere to vote — we will come with the ballots and the ballot boxes to your home.”

Russia’s electoral commission claimed that nearly 1.4 million votes had been cast in remote regions by March 11. In the last Russian presidential election, held in 2018, remote regions in Russia’s far north and east accounted for just 180,000 votes.

Ukrainian officials say this turnout is achieved by intimidation.

“‘Voting’ is conducted at gunpoint,” Dmytro Lubinets, the human rights ombudsman in Ukraine’s Parliament, said in a statement this month. “Participation in such ‘elections’ is a matter of survival.”

The actual wishes of the majority of the residents are impossible to decipher. No independent opinion polls have been published in the occupied territories since the invasion. And the exodus of pro-Ukrainian residents mean that many of those who remain often support, or have at least resigned themselves, to the occupation.

Russian officials have justified extraordinary voting procedures in the occupied territories as a security necessity. Ukrainian forces and partisans have frequently targeted Russian collaborators and occupation officials, including electoral workers.

Most recently, a deputy mayor of Berdiansk, on the Azov Sea coast, died in a car explosion on March 6. Ukraine’s military intelligence took responsibility, saying the official, Svetlana Samoilenko, was assassinated for forcing residents to “participate in illegal, fake voting.”

Ukrainian officials say Russia is also using elections to identify residents who are unhappy with its rule. The government in Kyiv says Ukrainians are routinely jailed, tortured or summarily executed by invading forces under a campaign of forced “Russification” of the occupied territories.

“If you vote, you are loyal to Russia, you have opportunities,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst. “If not, well, then you will be under pressure. You will be investigated.”

NYTFEED020240331ek3v0018h,A Book Found in a Cairo Market Launched a 30-Year Quest: Who Was the Writer?,"For Iman Mersal, the slim novel was “life altering.” She narrates her journey in the footsteps of its largely forgotten author in “Traces of Enayat.”

Crouching over piles of books in a market stall in Cairo one day in the fall of 1993, Iman Mersal stumbled upon a slim volume with a gray cover and a catchy title: “Love and Silence.”","Mersal, who was then a graduate student, thought the author might be related to a novelist and prominent anticolonial figure, Latifa al-Zayyat. She bought the book for one Egyptian pound.

What Mersal found instead was an intimate, introspective novel, an essential but largely forgotten work by a female writer in early contemporary Egypt. The voice, Mersal later wrote, was “modern, strange, limpid and beyond categorization.”

The book moved her, she said, and set her on a nearly 30-year journey to learn what she could about the author, a young Egyptian woman called Enayat al-Zayyat who died by suicide in 1963 after overdosing on pills. All she left was a note by her bed for her son, Abbas, that read: “I do love you, it’s just that life is unbearable. Forgive me.” After her death, her writing fell into oblivion.

In “Traces of Enayat,” translated by Robin Moger and to be published on April 2 in the United States by Transit Books, Mersal revives the story of the late writer. The Arabic version, published in 2019, won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award two years later and was a regional success. A mix of literary genres, the book is a subtle and universal exploration of identity.

“A sense of longing for a place and a self that has left you comes through in the pages,” Adam Levy, the book’s U.S. editor, said.

The book feels like a biography, he said, but it is more ambitious, and more interesting, than that. “As you read,” he added, “you start to feel Iman’s presence in it subtly.”

Mersal, who is now 57 and one of the most consequential Egyptian authors of her generation, grew up in Mit Adlan, a village in the delta of the Nile, in northern Egypt. As a child, she loved language and songs, often shutting herself in her room to listen to music, plays and narrated movies on the radio.

She lost her mother at a young age, and wrote her first poem, a critique of Mother’s Day that started with the phrase “against motherhood,” when she was in fifth grade. She wrote it in anger, she said, and read it out loud during a celebration in the school courtyard.

“One of the toughest teachers cried,” said Mersal, who has two sons. “I call myself a writer since.”

Al-Zayyat came of age during a golden era for Egyptian literature, in the 1950s and 1960s, during Gamal Abdel Nasser’s government. Many influential writers in that era were driven by the urge to transform society. Mersal, too, socialized with writers who wanted to change the world, and joined a feminist publication, “Bint al Ard,” in 1986. But she wasn’t sure what kind of intellectual she wanted to become.

“The literary scene was controlled by the old guard who believed in Arab nationalism or communism, who believed that literature can change the status quo,” she said. “I was thinking about figuring out my own voice. Expressing my relationship with my father, my relationship with Cairo, my city. It was about individuality.”

In 1992, she visited Baghdad to meet with women affected by the Gulf War in Iraq and the brutality of the regime in their own country. It was then that Mersal started questioning her purpose.

“It was transformative. I faced many questions,” said Mersal during an interview from her work studio in Edmonton, Alberta, where she lives. “What does Arab nationalism mean, what does it mean to be a committed writer?”

New perspectives opened up when she discovered “Love and Silence,” another woman’s honest chronicle of suffering and self-discovery. The book, which came out four years after al-Zayyat’s death, tells the story of Najla, a young woman who is grieving the recent loss of her brother and figuring out her place in a fraught political context. The narrator’s unfiltered voice sketches Najla’s attempts at finding herself, failing brutally each time.

Though al-Zayyat’s book had its flaws, Mersal said, it was life-altering. Mersal had been facing depression and searching for meaning in her life, she said. “This book spoke to me in a way no other female writer spoke to me.”

Mersal moved to the United States in 1998 and later to Canada, where she has lived since as an academic, poet, translator and author. Al-Zayyat grew up in a very different world, among the high society of Cairo.

Over the years, Mersal took her time to carefully navigate al-Zayyat’s world. She includes this journey in her book, taking the reader to places few can access, such as a meeting with al-Zayyat’s childhood friend, the iconic Egyptian actress Nadia Lutfi.

Al-Zayyat grew up in a loving family and was particularly close to her father, but struggled with depression most of her life. She had a passion for drawing and painting but stopped studying before she turned 19 to marry a man from an affluent family. The marriage was agonizing, and soon ended in a bitter divorce.

In Mersal’s book, an entry from al-Zayyat’s journal dated 1962 captured her pain. “I don’t mean a thing to anybody. Lost, found, it’s all the same: Here is as good as gone. The world wouldn’t tremble either way. When I walk I leave no tracks, like I walk on water, and I am unseen, invisible.”

What led al-Zayyat to end her life is uncertain. A commercial film and a radio series were made based on her novel. Both disappointed Mersal and al-Zayyat’s niece. They felt that, among other issues, the productions had erased the substance of the novel and focused on elements of the plot.

During her last months, al-Zayyat lived in an apartment that her father built for her on the second floor of their villa in Dokki, then a wealthy residential suburb of Cairo. She wrote on a newly-acquired Optima typewriter, and was committed to getting her book published. At the same time, she was losing custody of her son in court.

After her mother received a call from the publishing house saying that the manuscript had been rejected, al-Zayyat chopped off her hair and locked herself in the apartment. According to Mersal, who spoke to the author’s sister and to her best friend, she was found dead the next day.

It seemed that being part of the upper class limited her possibilities, Mersal explained — as if society had disappointed her so much that death was the only form of protest that remained.

“The idea that a young woman would kill herself — a young woman with a son, a father and a best friend — and all because of a book, was genuinely tragic, but it was also seductive in its tragedy,” Mersal wrote in the book. “I pictured Enayat painstakingly acquiring the rudiments of good Arabic grammar and inflection, then carefully setting down everything she wanted to say in her novel, then refusing the suggestion that she should self-publish.”

Mersal had many questions that she attempted to answer over her long years of obsessive research, but her intent never was to write a biography or a history book, she said.

“Telling the story of searching for Enayat was my way of reading her life and not displaying her life,” she said. “My dream was to tell our story, my story, her story, this interaction between us. The past is not that glorious. It’s the collective and individual wounds of this past.”

When Mersal finished writing the book, she struggled with emptiness and sadness that echoed al-Zayyat’s.

“It felt like a friend died,” she said. “It was a weird feeling of mourning.”"
NYTFEED020240309ek39003jt,Pope Says Ukraine Should Have the ‘Courage of the White Flag’,"His words have raised questions about whether Francis was suggesting that Ukraine surrender, but a Vatican spokesman said the pope meant “cease-fire and negotiation.”

Pope Francis has reiterated in a new interview that Ukraine should negotiate to end the war with Russia, but this time he used language — adopting his interviewer’s expression, “white flag” — that has drawn attention and raised questions about whether the pope was suggesting that Ukraine surrender.","On Saturday night, the Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, immediately clarified that the pope meant “cease-fire and negotiation,” not surrender, when he said white flag, a universal symbol for giving up.

But the pope’s words and others he used during the interview have underscored how the Vatican has often bewildered Ukraine’s officials and supporters struggling to understand its position.

Early in the war, many Ukrainians expressed frustration with Francis for his refusal to specifically call out Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, as the aggressor in the conflict.

Francis eventually became more vocal in expressing support for what he came to call “martyred Ukraine,” citing Russia’s aggression and praying for Ukraine’s innocent victims. But the Vatican had also sought to avoid taking sides in the war, in part to preserve the possibility that it could be called on to negotiate a peace deal, a hope many geopolitical analysts consider delusional.

Francis used the term white flag in a television interview taped in February with the Swiss television channel RSI. The topic of the interview was the color white. An interviewer asked Francis if he believed that in Ukraine there was the need to “surrender, the white flag in this case,” or if such a capitulation would only legitimize the actions of strongmen.

According to footage of the pope’s interview provided by the public broadcaster, which is to be aired later this month, Francis responded by saying the fear of encouraging the aggressor was “one interpretation, it’s true. But I believe that the strongest is the one who sees the situation, thinks of the people, and has the courage of the white flag, and to negotiate.”

Mr. Bruni said the pope was using the image proposed by the interviewer to indicate “the ceasing of hostilities, the peace reached with the courage of negotiation.” He pointed out that later in the interview, Francis said, “negotiation is never a surrender.”

But in that same sentence, Francis calls negotiation “the courage to not bring a country to its suicide.”

On Sunday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, responding to the pope’s comments, said on the social media platform X that Ukraine’s “flag is a yellow and blue one,” not white.

“This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail,” he wrote. “We shall never raise any other flags.”

The pope has made other statements that have made Ukrainian officials and supporters uneasy, once saying that there was a secret Vatican “mission” to bring peace to the conflict. His habit of giving audiences to allies and officials of Mr. Putin’s government and his blanket condemnation of the arms trade — when Kyiv needs weapons to defend itself — has also undermined the confidence of some Ukrainians in the pope’s support for their cause.

In the interview with RSI, Francis said that today “one can negotiate with the help of international powers, they are there, no? That word negotiate, it is a courageous word.”

He added, “When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate.”

“And you are ashamed of yourself?” for negotiating, he continued, adding that if instead, one continued on the same path, “how many dead, and then? In the end it will be worse still.”

He added that it was critical “to negotiate in time, find some country that can act as a mediator.”

“Today, for example,” he went on, “in the war in Ukraine, there are many that want to be mediators, no? Turkey for example. Do not be ashamed to negotiate before things get worse.”

Francis has himself frequently sought to position the Vatican as such a mediator. Asked in the interview if he would be willing to play such a role, he responded: “I am here, period. I’ve said this.”

Mr. Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, added on Saturday that the pope’s hope remains that a diplomatic solution can be reached for a “just and lasting peace.”"
NYTFEED020240317ek3h001b9,Iceland Volcano Erupts in Plumes of Fire With Little Notice,"The authorities said the eruption on Saturday night was the most powerful of a series that started in December.

A volcano erupted with little notice in southern Iceland on Saturday night, the latest in a string of eruptions in the area, threatening local infrastructure and leading the authorities to declare a state of emergency.","Lava fountains burst out of the ground, and a nearly two-mile-long fissure opened up on the Reykjanes Peninsula around 8:30 p.m., the Icelandic Meteorological Office said. The eruption occurred near the town of Grindavik, the Svartsengi Power Plant and the Blue Lagoon, one of Iceland’s most famous tourist attractions.

The meteorological office said that it had received indications of a possible eruption only about 40 minutes before it happened. The office sent out its first warning moments before the eruption began.

The Blue Lagoon and Grindavik were evacuated shortly after the eruption, according to RUV, the national broadcaster. Grindavik has a population of about 4,000, but few residents were in the town at the time. About 700 visitors were staying at the Blue Lagoon.

On Sunday morning, Hjordis Gudmundsdottir, a spokeswoman for the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, told reporters that the biggest risk was to two pipes that carried hot water from the geothermal Svartsengi Power Plant to homes on the peninsula.

Shortly after midnight, lava flowed over a road toward a water distribution pipe from the power plant, according to an update from the Icelandic Meteorological Office at 1 p.m. local time.

The lava has not moved much since Sunday morning, and it was about 200 meters from the pipe. Response workers were monitoring the speed of the lava, which has been “slow and steady since this morning,” the office said.

The eruption was most likely the biggest of the seven that have occurred across the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021, including four since December, the civil protection agency said in a statement. Before that, the peninsula had laid dormant for 800 years.

Meteorologists have expressed concerns that if the lava continues at the same rate, it could flow into the North Atlantic. Contact between lava and water can create small explosions and dangerous gases."
NYTFEED020240306ek36000xd,"Venezuela anuncia que las elecciones serán en julio, mientras la candidata de la oposición sigue inhabilitada","La decisión de realizar elecciones es un cumplimiento parcial de un compromiso con EE. UU., pero con la exclusión de la principal figura de la oposición muchos se preguntan si la votación será libre y justa.

Las autoridades venezolanas anunciaron el martes que las elecciones nacionales que muchos esperaban que forjaran un camino hacia la democracia se celebrarán el 28 de julio.","Pero la decisión sobre la fecha se produce un mes después de que el más alto tribunal del país excluyera de la votación a la principal candidata de la oposición, lo que hizo que muchos se preguntaran hasta qué punto serán unas elecciones libres y justas.

Sin embargo, el anuncio del gobierno del presidente Nicolás Maduro implica al menos un cumplimiento parcial del compromiso adquirido con Estados Unidos de celebrar comicios este año a cambio del levantamiento de las sanciones económicas paralizantes.

En octubre, Maduro firmó un acuerdo con la oposición del país y se comprometió a trabajar por unas elecciones presidenciales libres y justas. En el acuerdo, Maduro dijo que celebraría elecciones antes de finales de año, y Estados Unidos, a su vez, levantó algunas sanciones como muestra de buena voluntad.

Pero pocos días después, Maduro vio cómo una candidata de la oposición, María Corina Machado, ganaba más del 90 por ciento de los votos en las elecciones primarias organizadas por la oposición, que no tuvieron la participación del gobierno. Los decisivos resultados acentuaron su popularidad y plantearon la posibilidad de que pudiera derrotarlo en unas elecciones generales.

Desde entonces, el gobierno de Maduro inhabilitó a Machado para postularse, por lo que considera como irregularidades financieras ocurridas cuando era diputada nacional, y ha detenido a varios miembros de su campaña. En los eventos de Machado, se han presentado hombres en motocicleta que han atacado a sus simpatizantes.

La flexibilización temporal de las sanciones estadounidenses al sector del petróleo y el gas expira el 18 de abril, y el gobierno de Joe Biden podría optar por volver a imponerlas.

El anuncio del martes “deja meridianamente claro que Venezuela no celebrará elecciones libres y justas este año” y “prácticamente garantiza que el gobierno de Biden volverá a imponer sanciones”, declaró Geoff Ramsey, experto en Venezuela del Atlantic Council, institución de investigación con sede en Washington.

El chavismo, el movimiento de inspiración socialista que lidera Maduro, ha controlado Venezuela durante 25 años. En 2013, Maduro llegó al poder tras la muerte de su predecesor, el presidente Hugo Chávez, y se mantuvo en el poder tras unas elecciones celebradas en 2018 cuyos resultados se consideraron ampliamente fraudulentos. A esas elecciones siguió un periodo de aislamiento internacional, en el que muchos países siguieron el ejemplo de Estados Unidos y se negaron a hacer negocios con Venezuela.

La fecha de las próximas elecciones, el 28 de julio, es el cumpleaños de Chávez. El anuncio se produjo en la fecha de su muerte, el 5 de marzo.

Phil Gunson, analista de International Crisis Group quien está radicado en Caracas, la capital del país, dijo que es probable que esa decisión busque aprovechar el legado de Chávez para reforzar la capacidad de elección de Maduro, quien es profundamente impopular.

Los candidatos de la oposición tienen hasta el 25 de marzo para inscribirse. No está claro si el partido de Machado intentará insistir en su candidatura o si buscará apoyar a otro candidato.

Es probable que una oposición fragmentada pueda ser una ventaja para la candidatura de Maduro.

“La combinación de una oposición dividida, una fuerte abstención y unos oponentes débiles le da la mejor oportunidad de ganar sin tener que cometer fraude”, dijo Gunson."
NYTFEED020240329ek3t006y1,Trump and Allies Appeal Ruling That Allowed Georgia Prosecutor to Keep Case,"The defendants in the election interference case are once again pressing their argument that Fani T. Willis should be removed from the prosecution.

Calling the Atlanta prosecutor Fani T. Willis “utterly unrepentant,” lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump and eight of his co-defendants in the Georgia election interference investigation asked an appeals court on Friday to reverse a judge’s ruling that allowed her to stay on the case.","Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court ruled this month that Ms. Willis, the district attorney, could keep the case. But he said she could do so only if her subordinate, Nathan J. Wade, a special prosecutor with whom she had a romantic relationship, stepped aside. Mr. Wade subsequently resigned from the Trump case, which he had run for more than two years.

But in Friday’s 51-page filing to the Georgia Court of Appeals, defense lawyers argued that this was not enough. Ms. Willis and her entire office must be disqualified, they said, in order to restore “the public’s faith in the integrity of the judicial system.”

The defense lawyers maintained that the romance had created an untenable conflict of interest. Judge McAfee, in a March 15 order, found no “actual” conflict. But he said that the romance had created an “appearance of impropriety.”

Defense lawyers said the judge had made a “plain legal error requiring reversal.”

It is unclear whether the appellate court, which leans conservative, will take up the appeal of the decision by Judge McAfee, who was appointed by the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp. Legal analysts generally regarded his ruling on the disqualification matter as reflecting his cautious approach as he seeks middle ground in the contentious case.

Ms. Willis’s office did not comment on the latest filing, though she has zealously defended her conduct. “I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told one of the defense lawyers during testimony this month, as she emphasized that it was the defendants who were on trial for trying to steal an election.

Last weekend, in the wake of the judge’s ruling, she told CNN “I’m not embarrassed by anything I’ve done,” adding that “my greatest crime is I had a relationship with a man, but that’s not something I find embarrassing in any way.”

Defense lawyers highlighted those and other similar comments in their new filing.

Judge McAfee had already given the defendants permission to pursue their appeal. But under Georgia law, the co-defendants must also secure the approval of the Georgia Court of Appeals before the matter can be heard by a panel of three appellate judges. The appeals court has 45 days to decide whether to grant or deny the appeal application.

The effort to disqualify Ms. Willis led to multiple days of hearings that delved into salacious details of her personal life. Defense lawyers argued that she had engaged in “self-dealing” by taking vacations with Mr. Wade and allowing him to pay for at least some of the cost of the trips.

They reiterated that criticism in their most recent filing. “No prosecutor has ever been so reckless and relentless in pursuit of personal gain,” they wrote.

Judge McAfee was ultimately unmoved by such arguments. But in his ruling this month, he criticized Ms. Willis for a “tremendous lapse in judgment” in dating Mr. Wade. He also pointed to lingering questions about whether Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade “testified untruthfully,” stating that the hearings had left an “odor of mendacity” hanging over the matter.

The drama over the romance served to distract from the criminal charges contained in the August indictment of Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies. The charging document described myriad efforts to overturn Mr. Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia, and four of the defendants have since taken plea deals.

Defense lawyers continue to claim that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade lied under oath and in court filings. They also renewed their argument that a speech Ms. Willis gave at an Atlanta church could prejudice a jury. In that speech in January, she suggested that the criticism directed at her and Mr. Wade, both of whom are Black, was motivated by racism.

The defense lawyers argue that the appeals court needs to step in to clarify whether such behavior should result in the disqualification of a district attorney.

The Georgia case is one of four criminal cases Mr. Trump is facing, and in each of them, his lawyers have engaged in delaying tactics as the November general election approaches. A Manhattan judge recently set an April 15 trial date for Mr. Trump’s criminal case involving charges that he falsified business records to hide a potential sex scandal. Trial dates have not been set for his two federal criminal cases, in Washington, D.C., and Florida.

Judge McAfee also recently ruled that a pretrial appeal could be sought by Harrison Floyd, a co-defendant in the case who formerly led a group called Black Voices for Trump. The judge had ruled against Mr. Floyd’s contention that prosecutors did not have the authority to pursue election-related charges against him because they did not first seek a referral from the state election board.

As in the disqualification appeal, Mr. Floyd must first secure the approval of the appellate court before his appeal can go forward.

It appears increasingly unlikely that the Georgia case will go to trial before the November election, although it is also unclear whether the appeal efforts will contribute to the delay. Judge McAfee has said that he will continue to address other pretrial motions in the case regardless of what the appeals court decides to do with regard to the disqualification effort."
NYTFEED020240215ek2f003s5,Takeaways From the Hearing in the Georgia Trump Case,"Fani T. Willis, the district attorney, defended her personal conduct in a tense courtroom appearance as defense lawyers sought to disqualify her from the prosecution of Donald J. Trump and his allies in Georgia.

It was one of the most striking developments yet in the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald J. Trump and his allies: The two lead prosecutors took the witness stand Thursday in a daylong hearing, with defense attorneys grilling them about their personal lives.","The defense is arguing that Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, and her office should be disqualified and removed from the prosecution, accusing her of benefiting financially from a relationship with the lead prosecutor that she hired to manage the case, Nathan Wade.

If the judge removes them from the case, it would delay and potentially derail a proceeding that has major implications for the 2024 presidential election. Here are takeaways from the combative hearing:

Defense lawyers focused on spending by the couple.

In some of the sharpest questioning of the day, defense lawyers pressed Mr. Wade on his finances, attempting to raise doubt about his assertions that Ms. Willis had repaid him with cash for her share of expensive trips while they were dating, including to Belize, Aruba, Tennessee and California.

Mr. Wade called Ms. Willis an “independent strong woman” who insisted that “she is going to pay her own way.” Regarding a trip to California, he said, “everything we did when we got into Napa, she paid for.” But Mr. Wade also said she typically reimbursed him in cash, so there were no receipts available.

Ms. Willis forcefully rebutted suggestions that she had not paid her share of the trips, saying that she keeps thousands of dollars in cash secured at her home. “For many many years, I’ve kept money in my house,” she said.

A former friend challenged the timeline of the relationship.

Defense attorneys have said that the relationship between the two prosecutors started before Mr. Wade was hired in November 2021. Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade have disputed that, saying the relationship started in early 2022.

Their timeline was disputed Thursday by testimony from a former friend of Ms. Willis, Robin Bryant-Yeartie, who said she had “no doubt” that the two had started a romantic relationship earlier than they have claimed.

But Mr. Wade, who testified for several hours, stood firm in the assertion that the relationship began only after he was hired. He also revealed that it had ended in summer 2023.

Fani Willis pushed back hard at the defense lawyers.

The sparring between Ms. Willis and the defense lawyers grew so tense at various points that the presiding judge, Scott McAfee, warned the parties several times to limit their answers in order to preserve decorum.

Ms. Willis angrily accused defense lawyers of spreading lies about her and Mr. Wade.

“I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told a defense attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, at one point. It is the defendants, she said, who are on trial for trying to steal an election.

A disqualification would be a major roadblock in the Trump prosecution.

If Judge McAfee determines that Ms. Willis has a conflict of interest, and that it merits disqualification, the case would then be reassigned to another Georgia prosecutor, who would have the ability to continue with the case exactly as it is, make major changes — such as adding or dropping charges or defendants — or to even drop the case altogether.

It would be up to a state entity called the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia to find someone else to take up the case. The council’s executive director, Pete Skandalakis, has been criticized for moving slowly in the effort to find a prosecutor to consider whether Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, should also face charges related to the Trump case.

But the case against Mr. Trump and the other defendants is a different circumstance, since a grand jury has already handed down charges. Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies were charged last August with racketeering in connection with a plot to subvert the 2020 presidential election results. Four of the defendants have already pleaded guilty."
NYTFEED020240321ek3l008sp,He Fled War in Ukraine. Then the U.S. Arrested Him for Racketeering.,"Viktor Zelinger, a Ukrainian native, admitted to running an illegal gambling club in Brooklyn and threatening debtors.

Was Viktor Zelinger a mobster or a desperate refugee?","The answer, after a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday, seemed to be that he was both.

Mr. Zelinger, 45, pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering, admitting that he had helped run an illegal gambling club and had threatened debtors to make them pay.

When he was arrested in Switzerland in 2022, prosecutors said that he had led a ruthless crew linked to an Eastern European mafia group known as Thieves in Law that wreaked havoc in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, Sheepshead Bay and Coney Island.

The slew of charges against him included directing a May 2016 arson in a residential building on Voorhies Avenue where a high-stakes poker game was being held. The blaze nearly killed two teenagers and left a firefighter with career-ending injuries, prosecutors said.

The game competed with his own illegal gambling spot on Coney Island Avenue, where players were plied with free alcohol, cocaine and massages, according to court documents. Months later, as investigators closed in, Mr. Zelinger left the country permanently.

A grand jury indictment unsealed that October included charges against Mr. Zelinger and eight others; two other defendants were later added to the case. All were convicted or pleaded guilty to racketeering and related charges.

But Mr. Zelinger’s lawyer, Susan Kellman, painted a dramatically different story of his life, arguing that he was a dedicated father whose life had been upended by illness and war.

In a motion filed last year, she wrote that after moving back to his native Ukraine in 2016, he had married a woman who was diagnosed with a brain tumor after giving birth to the last of their three children.

When war broke out, it became impossible to find treatment, and she died from her illness, Ms. Kellman wrote. Mr. Zelinger was then displaced by fighting along with his children, then ages 6, 4 and 2. The family lived in their car and traveled by night to avoid the fighting, finally escaping to Slovenia before making their way to Switzerland, she wrote.

“If he’s the boss or he has links to the Eastern European mafia, whatever that is, it would have seemed to me he would have had a much easier time when he was overseas fighting for his life and his family’s life,” Ms. Kellman said at a hearing last year.

“But there was nobody there to help him.”

Once they were settled in Switzerland, Mr. Zelinger received a phone call telling him to report to a local police station to enroll the children in school, according to his account. But it was a trap. When he arrived, he was arrested, and the children were put in an orphanage. But “miraculously,” in Ms. Kellman’s words, they were rescued by the chief rabbi of Zurich, who arranged for them to be sent to live with their grandmother in Brooklyn.

Mr. Zelinger’s family was not present at the hearing on Thursday, which lasted 90 minutes as Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon parsed the complicated plea agreement. Mr. Zelinger pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering but admitted to a role in other crimes, allowing those to be factored into the judge’s decision on sentencing. He wore prison khakis and a dark, close-cropped beard at the hearing and was aided by a Russian interpreter.

The maximum penalty on the charges under federal sentencing guidelines would be 20 years. But the prosecutor in the case, Victor Zapana of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, said on Thursday that he and the defense had agreed to recommend a sentence of five to six years. That hearing is scheduled for July 18 before Judge Brian M. Cogan.

Mr. Zelinger, who moved to Brooklyn in 2001 and later became a citizen, is likely to lose his U.S. citizenship and be deported once his sentence is completed."

Ukraine fired a volley of exploding drones at Moscow and other targets on the final day of Russia’s presidential vote on Sunday, the local authorities said, continuing a flurry of attacks over the past week timed for the rubber-stamp election.","The assaults combine strategic goals — diverting Russian troops from the front inside Ukraine and destroying energy infrastructure — with a political objective, namely undermining President Vladimir V. Putin’s long-cultivated image as a leader protecting Russia.

In recent days, ground assaults along the Russian border appeared to be the most disruptive of the attacks. On Sunday, Russian officials said that Ukraine had targeted seven regions of the country. The Russian military said it had shot down 35 exploding drones.

An oil refinery was set on fire in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia and air defense forces shot down two drones flying toward Moscow, Russian officials said.

The governor of the Krasnodar region, Veniamin Kondratyev, said debris from drones shot down by the military had ignited the fire at the oil refinery.

Four drones were shot down in the Yaroslavl region, which is northeast of Moscow, according to the local authorities.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine’s military on the attacks inside Russia.

In his nightly address to Ukrainians on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky praised domestic arms production that has grown to produce long-range weaponry capable of hitting targets deep inside Russia.

“These weeks have demonstrated to many that the Russian war machine has vulnerabilities that we can reach with our weapons,” Mr. Zelensky said. “What our own drones are capable of is a true Ukrainian long-range capability.”

Sunday’s drone attacks came amid continuing skirmishes along a stretch of border between the Sumy and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine and the Belgorod and Kursk regions of Russia.

Three groups of Russian exiles supported by Ukraine’s military intelligence agency have been attacking along the border since Tuesday, in what could be the largest ground assault into Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russia has responded by bombarding the towns and villages in Ukraine where the exile groups are staging. Ukraine’s military on Sunday reported 69 strikes over the past day in the Sumy region.

Elsewhere, two missiles struck the city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine on Sunday, according to Vitaliy Kim, the head of the regional military administration. He wrote on Telegram that one person was killed there and eight others injured. In Nikopol, a southern Ukrainian city, an exploding drone hit a gas station, injuring three people. And authorities in the Odesa region in the south reported drone strikes that damaged agricultural warehouses, but no casualties."
NYTFEED020240306ek360063h,Russia Strikes Odesa With Missile During Visit by Zelensky and Greek Leader,"Neither man was hurt, and it was unclear whether the Russian Army was targeting them.

Russia launched a missile strike on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa on Wednesday while President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece were visiting.","Neither was hurt, and they continued their visit of Odesa, a strategic port city. It is unclear how close they were to the explosion, and a Ukrainian Army spokeswoman, Natalia Humeniuk, denied that the attack had specifically targeted the state leaders. “This is in no way related to a specific visit,” she said.

Mr. Mitsotakis said at a news conference in Odesa that he and Mr. Zelensky were visiting the city’s port at the time of the assault. “We heard the sound of sirens and explosions that were very close to us,” he said. “We didn’t have time to go to a shelter.”

Dmytro Pletenchuck, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Navy, said that Russia had struck port infrastructure in the city and that five people had been killed. Ms. Humeniuk said Russia had most likely used ballistic missiles.

“You see who we are dealing with,” Mr. Zelensky said. “They don’t care where they strike, whether they are military, civilians, international guests — it doesn’t matter to these people.”

Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker who was in Odesa at the time of the attack, said it occurred around 10:40 a.m. “I heard explosions, I was very close to the port,” he said in a text message. “It was very loud.”

Russia said that its army had launched “a high-precision missile strike on a hangar in the industrial port area of Odesa were preparations were being made for the combat use of unmanned boats of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.”

Ukraine has frequently used sea drones to target vessels of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. On Tuesday, it claimed to have sunk a patrol ship off the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea. “This is the third Russian Black Sea Fleet vessel sunk in the past five weeks,” Britain’s military intelligence said.

Odesa, a lifeline for the Ukrainian economy, is home to a vast port infrastructure vital to Ukraine’s Black Sea exports. Many vessels depart from the port to ship grain and other agricultural products across the Black Sea.

But for past six months, Russia has been targeting grain silos and naval infrastructure with drones and missiles. “They are trying to attack and destroy the potential of a country that is at war and is trying to rebuild its economy to support the front,” Ms. Humeniuk said.

The attacks have also caused civilian casualties, either from direct targeting or falling debris. Last week, a drone hit a residential building, killing 12 civilians. It took rescue workers several days to pull the bodies from the rubble, including those of babies and children.

Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Mitsotakis visited the site of last week’s attack on Wednesday to pay tribute to the victims, laying bouquets of flowers at a makeshift memorial in front of the building. They also visited a cathedral badly damaged by a previous Russian missile strike.

The Ukrainian leader said at the news conference that Wednesday’s attack “speaks to the fact that we need to defend ourselves first and foremost.”

NYTFEED020240306ek36000dx,Ex-President of Honduras Denies at Trial That He Trafficked Drugs,"Juan Orlando Hernández, who is accused of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States, also denied receiving a bribe from the Mexican drug lord El Chapo.

The former two-term president of Honduras denied in court on Tuesday that he had trafficked narcotics, offered police protection to drug cartels or taken bribes — assertions that have been at the heart of a conspiracy trial taking place in Manhattan.","The former president, Juan Orlando Hernández, has been on trial for two weeks in Federal District Court, facing charges that he conspired to import cocaine into the United States. Prosecutors said that he worked with ruthless drug gangs like the Sinaloa Cartel, led by the Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzman Loera, better known as El Chapo.

Government witnesses have included a string of former traffickers from Honduras who testified that they bribed Mr. Hernández in return for promises that he would insulate them from investigations and protect them from extradition to the United States.

Dressed in a dark suit with a blue shirt and tie, Mr. Hernández sat up straight during his testimony and sometimes gave long, discursive answers that prompted the judge overseeing the trial to rein him in.

At other times his answers were terse.

“Did you ever receive a bribe from El Chapo?” one of Mr. Hernández’s lawyers asked at one point.

“Never,” Mr. Hernández replied.

He gave the same answer to successive questions about whether he had ever met El Chapo, his traffickers or anyone purporting to be a member of the Sinaloa cartel.

When one of his lawyers asked if he had promised cartels that he would protect them, Mr. Hernández answered: “On the contrary, sir. The problem was that we were going to terminate them.”

Throughout the trial, rows of benches in the courtroom have been filled with Hondurans attending to watch Mr. Hernández face a judicial process of the sort some doubted could have taken place in Honduras. Those who could not find a seat in the courtroom have instead watched the proceedings on a tall screen in an overflow room on a different floor of the courthouse.

During Mr. Hernández’s direct testimony on Tuesday, some in the courtroom gallery were rapt. At times others laughed derisively, and on one occasion a statement by Mr. Hernández was met with a long hiss.

It is almost always considered risky for a criminal defendant to testify because friendly questions from a defense lawyer are typically followed by a pointed cross-examination from prosecutors.

Some defendants decide to testify because they believe they can sway jurors; others may choose to take the stand when they feel that the tide of a trial is going against them and they have little to lose.

While cross-examining Mr. Hernández on Tuesday afternoon, a prosecutor asked him why various accused traffickers whose extradition had been requested by the United States had not been handed over while he was president. Mr. Hernández replied that his administration had referred all extradition requests to the Honduran Supreme Court.

Later, the prosecutor asked Mr. Hernández about a photograph taken during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that showed him with a man named Miguel Arnulfo Valle Valle, who was a leader of a violent drug gang. Mr. Hernández replied that he believed the picture had been the subject of a debate over whether it was fake or a “photomontage.”

“The person with his arm around you is Arnulfo Valle?” the prosecutor asked.

Mr. Hernández replied: “Sir, I don’t know Mr. Arnulfo Valle.”

During his political career as a member of the right-wing Honduran National Party, Mr. Hernández was seen as adept at accumulating power and willing to use it, sometimes bluntly.

When the Supreme Court threw out laws he had pushed through while serving as president of the Honduran Congress, the Congress simply replaced four justices. Later, the Supreme Court changed rules to allow Mr. Hernández to serve a second term as president of Honduras.

Political opponents claimed that both the presidential contests that Mr. Hernández won, in 2013 and 2017, were marred by fraud. Prosecutors in New York said that he financed both with drug money. Distrust of the 2017 election results led to protests that blocked roads and bridges.

Prosecutors said that Mr. Hernández gave money to a political party colleague who paid gang members to commit violence, and that demonstrators died during confrontations with security forces that followed.

By the time his second term ended, Mr. Hernández was deeply unpopular. His administration had failed to curb crime or create a healthy economy, which led in part to migration from Honduras. His successor as president, Xiomara Castro, accused Mr. Hernández of having turned the country into a “narco-dictatorship.” Thousands of Hondurans celebrated when he was extradited to New York.

On Tuesday, Mr. Hernández portrayed himself as a stalwart partner of U.S. officials in their fight to stem the flow of drugs over the country’s southern border. He said that he had several meetings about that with U.S. officials, including Gen. John Kelly, then the commander of the U.S. Army Southern Command.

“I asked General Kelly to help us in our fight against drug trafficking,” Mr. Hernández said, adding: “The Southern Command helped us set up an elite force that we called the Tigers.”

As Mr. Hernández was being cross-examined, spectators in the overflow room were more animated than those who had watched in the courtroom. At times laughter echoed in the room, including when Mr. Hernández professed puzzlement over the World Cup photo that showed him with Mr. Valle.

After the court session ended, Mr. Hernández buttoned his suit jacket, rose from the witness stand and was led by a federal marshal back to the seat at the defense table that he had occupied since the trial began."
NYTFEED020240325ek3p0053d,"Así se celebra el Holi, el festival de los colores, la tradición más vistosa de India","Este antiguo festival tiene una raíz hindú, pero cada vez más personas de todo el mundo participan de sus hogueras, cantos, bailes, oraciones, banquetes y nubes de polvos de colores.

Una neblina de arco iris recorre India, donde resuenan estridentes carcajadas mientras amigos y desconocidos se rocían, los unos a los otros, con los puños llenos de polvos de colores. Es la temporada de la antigua tradición hindú de Holi, una celebración anual de la primavera.","El 25 de marzo de 2024, nubes carmesí, esmeralda, añil y azafrán se ciernen sobre el país para celebrar una de sus fiestas más vibrantes, alegres y coloridas.

“Jugar al Holi”, como dicen los indios, se ha extendido mucho más allá de las fronteras de India.

El jolgorio comienza al atardecer

También conocido como el “festival de los colores”, el Holi (que se pronuncia como santo en inglés, holy, con una hache inicial aspirada), comienza la noche de luna llena del mes phalguna del calendario hindú, que cae alrededor de febrero o marzo.

La celebración comienza con el encendido de las hogueras. La gente se reúne en torno a las llamas para cantar, bailar y rezar durante un ritual nocturno llamado Holika Dahan, que recrea la desaparición de Holika, una demonio hindú mítica.

Se arrojan al fuego todo tipo de cosas, como leña, hojas y comida, en una purga simbólica del mal y el triunfo del bien.

Archie Singhal, de 24 años, va de Delhi a visitar a su familia en Gujarat la víspera del Holi, cuando se enciende el fuego por la noche. A la mañana siguiente, Singhal se prepara para las ráfagas de polvo, llamadas gulal, aplicándose aceite en el cuerpo para que los colores no se le peguen a la piel. También se pone ropa vieja que no le importa descartar.

¿Por qué los colores?

Las raíces del Holi se encuentran en el hinduismo. El dios Krishna, maldecido por un demonio de piel azul, se quejó con su madre preguntándole por qué Radha, su amada, era de piel clara y él no. Su madre, Yashoda, le sugiere juguetonamente que pinte la cara de Radha con los colores que desee. Entonces Krishna la pinta de colores para que ambos se parezcan.

El Holi es, en parte, una celebración del amor entre Krishna y Radha, que va más allá de las diferencias. Hoy en día, parte del gulal que se utiliza durante la festividad es sintético. Pero tradicionalmente los colores proceden de ingredientes naturales, como flores secas, cúrcuma, hojas secas, uvas, bayas, betabel y té.

“Hay un ambiente de libertad”, dijo Singhal, y añadió que ella no duda en lanzar colores sobre su hermano menor, sus padres, sus tíos y sus vecinos.

Todo el mundo participa

La antigua fiesta hindú evita las divisiones religiosas, sociales, políticas y de casta que apuntalan a menudo la sectaria sociedad india. Hindú o no, cualquiera puede ser salpicado con polvo de colores brillantes, o incluso con huevos y cerveza.

Algunos participan en el culto, llamado puja, ofreciendo plegarias a los dioses. Para otros, el Holi es una celebración de la comunidad. El festival involucra a todo el mundo, incluidos a los incautos transeúntes.

“La gente olvida sus malentendidos o enemistades durante esta ocasión y vuelven a ser amigos”, dice Ratikanta Singh, de 63 años, quien a veces escribe sobre Holi, en Assam, en el noreste de India.

El banquete

Cuando no están lanzando gulal, amigos, familiares y vecinos participan en un bufé de platos y bebidas tradicionales. Entre ellos, gujiya, unos dulces fritos rellenos de frutos secos; dahi vada, unos buñuelos de lentejas fritos servidos con yogur; y kanji, bebida tradicional elaborada con zanahorias fermentadas en agua y especias.

Algunos celebran el Holi con thandai, un brebaje de leche verde claro, pétalos de rosa, cardamomo, almendras, semillas de hinojo y otros ingredientes. Desde hace miles de años, la bebida se adereza a veces con bhang, u hojas de marihuana trituradas, que contribuyen al ambiente de juerga.

El Holi tiene raíces ancestrales

La festividad está documentada desde hace siglos en textos hindúes. La tradición es observada por jóvenes y mayores, sobre todo en el norte de India y Nepal, donde se origina la mitología del festival.

El Holi también marca el inicio de las cosechas con la llegada de la primavera en India, donde más de la mitad de la población vive en zonas rurales.

Las tradiciones varían según el país

Las celebraciones del Holi son tan diversas como el subcontinente indio. Son especialmente intensas en el norte de India, considerado el lugar de nacimiento del dios hindú Krishna, donde los festejos pueden durar más de una semana.

En Mathura, ciudad del norte donde se dice que nació Krishna, la gente recrea un relato hindú en el que Krishna visita a Radha para enamorarla y los amigos vaqueros de ella, ofendidos por sus insinuaciones, lo expulsan con palos.

En el estado oriental de Odisha se celebra un festival de un día de duración llamado Dola Purnima. Las grandes procesiones de gente que cargan al hombro carruajes ricamente decorados con estatuas de dioses hindúes son una parte importante de las festividades. Las procesiones están llenas del sonido de tambores, canciones, polvos de colores y pétalos de flores que se lanzan al aire.

En el sur de India, donde el Holi no se celebra tan ampliamente, muchos templos llevan a cabo ritos religiosos. En la comunidad tribal de Kudumbi, en el suroeste, los devotos de los templos cortan palmas de areca y transportan sus troncos al santuario en un ritual que simboliza la victoria del bien sobre el mal.

No solo se celebra en India

Holi se celebra en todo el mundo en donde haya ido la diáspora india. Más de 32 millones de indios y personas de origen indio están en el extranjero, la mayoría en Estados Unidos, donde residen 4,4 millones, según el gobierno indio.

También se disfruta mucho en países tan variados como Fiyi, Mauricio, Sudáfrica, el Reino Unido y otras partes de Europa.

El Holi se conoce como Phagwa en las comunidades indias del Caribe, como Guyana, Surinam y Trinidad y Tobago.

El gobierno indio también ha utilizado el festival para proyectar poder blando y rediseñar su imagen como parte de su campaña turística “India increíble”.

Durante el festival, “el mundo es una aldea global”, dijo Shubham Sachdeva, de 29 años, vecino de un suburbio del este de Delhi, quien añadió que sus amigos de Estados Unidos celebraban Holi con sus compañeros de piso, fueran o no indios. “Todo esto acerca el mundo a los demás”.

NYTFEED020240320ek3k002mk,Symbolism or Strategy? Ukraine Battles to Retain Small Gains.,"Despite American doubts, Ukrainians say that defending places with little strategic value is worth the cost in casualties and weapons, because the attacking Russians pay an even higher price.

Ukrainian soldiers spent hours ducking in trenches as artillery exploded around them, then dashed for the safety of an armored personnel carrier — only to be chased through the open rear ramp of the vehicle by an exploding drone.","“All I could see were sparks in my eyes,” said one of the soldiers, a sergeant, recounting how the pursuing drone blew up, leaving him and his team wounded but somehow still alive. He asked to be identified only by his first name, Oleksandr, according to military protocol.

Fighting on the plain in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, where Oleksandr’s vehicle was hit earlier this year, has raged for 10 months now in two phases: first with Ukrainian forces on the offense, and now on defense, as Russia escalates attacks on the area where Ukraine gained ground in last summer’s counteroffensive.

Military analysts have described Ukraine’s strategy as “hold, build and strike” — holding the line in the country’s southeast, replenishing its units with fresh troops and hitting back with long-range drones attacks on oil refineries and military logistics targets inside Russia.

In Zaporizhzhia, this has meant defending an area created by last summer’s counteroffensive, a 10-mile-deep semicircle that presses into Russian-held territory, forming a bulge. Soldiers describe ruined villages, trenches and fields that are a moonscape of shell craters.

At the southern tip of the semicircle lies the village of Robotyne. Ukraine recaptured it last summer, in the high-water mark of a counteroffensive that not only failed to achieve a breakthrough, but left the Russians in a strong enough position to start pushing back across the southern front.

Ukrainian forces occupying that bulge in the front line can be attacked from three sides, creating a dilemma: Abandoning that pocket would ease the pressure on them, but it would also signal a symbolic setback in the war, losing territory they gained last year at a high cost in casualties and destroyed weaponry.

Interviewed last week, soldiers who recently fought there described small sways in the front in both directions, and being badly outgunned by Russian artillery. Overall along the frontline, Russia is firing seven times as many artillery shells as Ukraine, General Ivan Havryliuk, a deputy minister of defense, told Ukrainian media on Monday.

American weaponry that had been donated for the counteroffensive last year, including Stryker armored vehicles, has proved useful in protecting soldiers from these barrages now as they fight defensively.

But U.S. politics now threaten the supply of arms. A package worth about $60 billion in military and financial assistance has been stalled in Congress for months over objections from some Republicans. The Biden administration last week announced it would send $300 million in stopgap military assistance using funds remaining from previously approved aid.

Russian forces attacked the pocket around Robotyne and areas nearby nine times over the past day, the general staff headquarters said on Tuesday. When the Ukrainians captured the village last year, they pierced a main Russian anti-tank defensive line; now the Russians are trying to push them back and fill in that gap.

Like Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Robotyne, which had a prewar population of about 500 people, is now just ruins. Throughout the war, American officials have repeatedly raised concerns that Ukraine was holding out too long in defending such places, committing soldiers and ammunition to cling to devastated towns with little strategic value.

But for Ukraine, the area around Robotyne remains worth fighting for, at least for now.

“At some point, symbolic becomes strategic,” Yurii Sak, a former adviser to the minister of defense, said of the fighting. Defending the gains of the offensive, he said, is “important for morale, it’s important for the support of the population, it’s important for the inner belief in our potential to win.”

The combat is also more costly in casualties for the attacking Russians than the Ukrainians in their defensive positions, Mr. Sak said. “As long as that calculus continues, it supports holding the ground,” he said. “It’s war, so casualties are inevitable on both sides.”

Russia is now on the offensive along the entire frontline, which stretches in a 600-mile-long crescent from the Russian border in northeastern Ukraine to the southern Dnipro River. The Kremlin’s military has been using its advantage in ammunition, manpower and aviation.

Russia has swelled the ranks of its army by deploying squads of former convicts. It is buying artillery shells, missiles and exploding drones from North Korea and Iran to help replenish its supplies. Its planes avoid Ukrainian air defenses by dropping bombs from a safe distance that glide to their targets.

Just this year, Russia has dropped more than 3,500 glide bombs, Ukraine’s military said. Moscow’s electronic warfare instruments jam signals and scramble coordinates for Ukraine’s satellite-guided weapons.

The result has been a grinding advance that in February pushed Ukraine out of the small city of Avdiivka in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Since then, Russia has been attacking with a combination of ground assaults and aerial bombing at seven points along the front, according to Ukraine’s general staff headquarters.

In the northeast, Russian forces are pushing through pine forests toward the city of Kupiansk on the Oskil River, seeking to reverse gains Ukraine made in a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022.

In the Donbas, a region of rolling hills dotted with coal mines and factories, Russia has been pressing along four lines of attack, seeking to exploit openings created by capturing Avdiivka. Ukrainian forces say they are holding defensive positions to the west of the city, though Russia has captured several small villages as it tries to advance.

Near the southern city of Kherson, Russia has been assaulting a Ukrainian outpost across the Dnipro River, on the eastern bank, in an area otherwise controlled by Russia. Russian forces assaulted the position three times on Monday, the Ukrainian military said.

The position there is resupplied by boat and, like the bulge in the lines around Robotyne, it is precarious.

These fights are worthwhile, Ukrainian officials have said, because they cost Russia tens of thousands of soldiers killed and wounded, but there is skepticism in Washington.

“I understand the administration has been frustrated,” Evelyn Farkas, director of the McCain Institute, said, referring to the Biden administration.

“It’s unclear whether military decisions are purely military or influenced by political pressure or even direction,” she said.

At the training for Ukrainian troops fighting in the semicircular area near Robotyne, soldiers noted one advantage to the shift to a defensive strategy: fewer casualties. Russians now must leave their trenches to attack, while the Ukrainians are fighting from the cover of their positions.

Pulling back, said a private, also named Oleksandr, would merely leave Ukrainian troops fighting in other positions in similar conditions. “You need to defend every meter,” he said.

Still, it is a fierce fight in the south, over a landscape of open fields, muddy roads, ruins of farmhouses and countless blown-up vehicles, facing Russian forces on three sides.

Ukrainians have been fighting in the area long enough to give the positions they are defending nicknames like The Wheel, Silicon and Tank Trench.

Russian reconnaissance drones continually fly overhead, directing artillery or mortar fire on the soldiers. Aerial bombardments are common.

Small drones rigged with explosives and cameras buzz in regularly, chasing cars and sometimes people. The one that flew into Sergeant Oleksandr’s armored personnel carrier in January wounded everyone inside, but all survived. Last week, he was training to return to the fighting in the same area."
NYTFEED020240315ek3f0073l,Takeaways From the Ruling on Georgia Trump Prosecutor’s Conduct,"Fani Willis faces an unusual decision after the much-anticipated ruling on whether she should be disqualified for having had a romantic relationship with a subordinate.

The much-anticipated ruling on whether Fani T. Willis should be disqualified from prosecuting former President Donald J. Trump and 14 of his allies in Georgia came on Friday, requiring her to make an unusual decision.","Ms. Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, Ga., can keep control of the state election interference case that has been more than three years in the making, but only if Nathan J. Wade, a former boyfriend, withdraws from the case, which she hired him to manage.

For much of this year, headlines and hearings delving into the romantic relationship between the two prosecutors have overshadowed the case itself, in which the defendants are charged with conspiring to thwart the will of Georgia voters after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election.

Defense lawyers brought to light the relationship between the prosecutors, saying it had created an untenable conflict of interest. But Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton Superior Court rejected that argument on Friday, while sharply criticizing Ms. Willis for a “tremendous lapse in judgment.”

Here are takeaways from the ruling:

The judge found an appearance problem, but not an actual conflict.

Judge McAfee said there was not enough proof to find that Ms. Willis’s “personal relationship and recurring travels with her lead prosecutor” created “an actual conflict of interest.”

He added that “Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices — even repeatedly — and it is the trial court’s duty to confine itself to the relevant issues and applicable law properly brought before it.”

But the judge did find that “the appearance of impropriety remains” and needs to be remedied. He concluded that “the prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the state selects one of two options.” Either Ms. Willis can step aside, along with her entire office, or Mr. Wade can leave, allowing the case to proceed without further distraction.

He emphasized that the appearance problem had to be fixed.

“When this danger goes uncorrected, it undermines the legitimacy and moral force of our already weakest branch of government,” he wrote.

The ruling repeatedly criticized Fani Willis.

The judge once worked for Ms. Willis in the district attorney’s office, and by all accounts had a positive experience with her as a boss. But in the ruling, he was harshly critical of her conduct, and not just because of the optics of carrying on a relationship with a subordinate on such a high-profile case.

He also criticized public comments she has made about the case and referred to “the unprofessional manner of the district attorney’s testimony” when she testified at a combative hearing last month.

Noting that neither side offered definitive proof of when the romance began, Judge McAfee wrote that “an odor of mendacity remains” about the matter, as do “reasonable questions” about whether Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade “testified untruthfully about the timing of their relationship.” Both told the judge that it started only after Ms. Willis hired Mr. Wade in November 2021.

No financial motive was found.

The judge rejected a key contention of the defense: that Ms. Willis had benefited financially from the case, since her romantic partner was being paid to run it and had paid, at least in part, for vacations they took together.

Judge McAfee noted that Ms. Willis brought charges against far fewer people than a special grand jury had recommended for indictment, undercutting the suggestion that she was trying to inflate legal billings around the case.

“The district attorney has not in any way acted in conformance with the theory that she arranged a financial scheme to enrich herself,” the judge wrote.

The judge opened the door to a potential gag order.

The judge appeared to invite the defense to seek a gag order to stop Ms. Willis from publicly discussing the case. He said that Ms. Willis, who is Black, had publicly “cast racial aspersions” on the defense’s decision to bring her relationship with Mr. Wade to light.

He was referring to a January speech that Ms. Willis made at a local church, when she suggested that the scrutiny of her decision to hire Mr. Wade was racist. The motion alleging a conflict of interest was filed on Jan. 8 by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for Michael Roman, a defendant who is a former Trump campaign operative.

The judge said the church speech was “too far removed from jury selection to establish a permanent taint of the jury pool,” but expressed concern nonetheless.

He also referred to what he called Ms. Willis’s “unorthodox decision to make on-the-record comments” to the authors of a recent book, “Find Me the Votes,” by the journalists Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman, noting that she spoke to the authors “during the pendency of this case.”

Judge McAfee wrote that “the time may well have arrived for an order preventing the state from mentioning the case in any public forum to prevent prejudicial pretrial publicity.”

An appeal seems likely, and a trial distant.

Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer in Georgia, Steven H. Sadow, said, “We believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade,” adding that “we will use all legal options available as we continue to fight to end this case, which should never have been brought in the first place.”

The defense will almost certainly seek to appeal, but the judge has to grant approval for them to do so ahead of a trial.

When the case might go to trial remains unclear. Last year, Ms. Willis asked for a trial to start this August, but the judge has yet to set a date. Even with the ruling against disqualification, most legal observers believe a trial is unlikely to start this year."
NYTFEED020240323ek3n00335,Names of Moscow Concert Attack Victims Begin to Emerge,"Those lost include mothers, fathers, an amateur hockey player and many others.

As emergency services combed the scene of the attack on a concert hall in Moscow, details on some of the victims began to emerge from officials and local news media.","Most of those identified so far appeared to be in their 40s, and many had traveled from other parts of the country to attend the concert where Piknik, a Russian rock band formed in the late 1970s, was slated to perform on Friday night.

Alexander Baklemyshev, 51, had long dreamed about seeing the band, his son told local media, and had traveled solo from his home city of Satka, some 1,000 miles east of Moscow, for the concert.

His son, Maksim, told the Russian news outlet MSK1 that his father had sent him a video of the concert hall before the attack. That was the last he heard from his father.

“There was no last conversation,” his son said. “All that was left is the video, and nothing more.”

Irina Okisheva and her husband, Pavel Okishev, also traveled hundreds of miles to attend the concert — making their way from Kirov, northeast of Moscow. Mr. Okishev had received the tickets as an early birthday present. He was set to turn 35 next week, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported. Both he and his wife died in the attack, the paper reported.

“Very painful and scary,” Ms. Okisheva’s colleagues wrote on a social media page for a photo studio where she worked. “The whole studio team is horrified by what happened.”

Anastasiya Volkova lost both of her parents in the attack. She told 5 TV that she had missed a call from her mother on Friday night at around the time of the attack. When she called back, there was no response, Ms. Volkova said.

“I couldn’t answer the phone. I didn’t hear the call,” Ms. Volkova told the broadcaster, adding that her mother had been “really looking forward to this concert.”

As the death toll climbed to 133 people, the Moscow region’s health care ministry published a preliminary list of victims. It had 41 names; Andrey Rudnitsky was one of them.

A forward in an amateur hockey league, he turned 39 years old last week, according to his page on the league’s website. Mr. Rudnitsky’s teammates told Pro Gorod, a local news website, that he had moved to Moscow last year from Yaroslavl but planned to return home to play there. Mr. Rudnitsky had two children.

Ekaterina Novoselova, 42, was also on the list. Ms. Novoselova won a beauty pageant in 2001 in her home city of Tver, 110 miles northwest of Moscow, one of the pageant organizer’s told the local news outlet TIA. It reported that she had moved to Moscow to work as a lawyer and is survived by her husband and two children.

Some people appeared to have been named by mistake. Yevgeniya Ryumina, 38, told Komsomolskaya Pravda that she had fled the concert hall to safety. But she had lost her ID, Ms. Ryumina said, suggesting that might have led to the confusion."
NYTFEED020240308ek38006mx,Israel Says Its Forces ‘Fired Precisely’ During Aid Convoy Chaos,"An initial review by the Israeli military of the episode differed from accounts of witnesses and Palestinian officials, who described extensive shooting after thousands massed around aid trucks.

Israeli soldiers “fired precisely” at Gazans who approached them during a chaotic scene near an aid convoy in northern Gaza last week that led to the deaths of dozens of Palestinians, but they did not fire on the convoy itself, the Israeli military said on Friday after an initial internal review.","The account differs sharply from those of witnesses and Palestinian officials who described extensive shooting after thousands of desperate Gazans massed around an Israeli-organized aid convoy. The deaths prompted global outrage and underscored the widespread hunger and hopelessness in northern Gaza, where five months of war and little aid have driven many to the brink.

The initial review largely matched Israel’s early account of the disaster, reiterating its claim that many civilians were harmed or killed in a stampede as they crowded around the aid trucks. It said that Israeli forces had opened fire toward dozens of Gazans who had approached them.

Gazan officials did not immediately respond to the Israeli review.

The Israeli military said that its review found that the soldiers had “fired precisely” at people who were approaching them in what it said was an attempt to keep “suspects” at a distance.

“As they continued to approach, the troops fired to remove the threat,” it said in a statement summarizing the review’s findings.

Hours after the disaster, doctors in Gaza described receiving scores of casualties at hospitals in the area, many of them killed or wounded by gunfire.

A fact-finding committee appointed by the Israeli military chief of staff will continue to investigate the episode, the military said. Some human rights groups say that the Israeli military lacks independent accountability mechanisms and rarely penalizes soldiers for harming Palestinians in contested circumstances."
NYTFEED020240304ek340050l,The Vienna Philharmonic Tours With a Favorite Conductor,"Franz Welser-Möst, who stands at the top of this storied orchestra’s roster of conductors, led three meaty programs at Carnegie Hall over the weekend.

The Vienna Philharmonic hasn’t had a chief conductor since 1933. But it has had favorite conductors.","Of the great musicians who have led this self-governing, proudly idiosyncratic orchestra, Leonard Bernstein and Pierre Boulez were made honorary members; Herbert von Karajan and Karl Böhm were given honorary conducting titles. The violinist Daniel Froschauer, the Philharmonic’s chairman, has said that today, the ensemble not so secretly has two maestros at the top of its roster: Riccardo Muti and Franz Welser-Möst.

At Carnegie Hall last weekend, it was the Austrian-born Welser-Möst, 63, who conducted three breathless, exhilarating and often moving performances by the Philharmonic, in meaty programs of Bruckner and Mahler symphonies, and works by Berg, Hindemith, Schoenberg, Strauss and Ravel.

It takes a lot to win over the affection of the Philharmonic, one of Europe’s finest ensembles, just as it takes a lot to join its ranks. These players — known for their lush sound, their brighter, higher tuning frequency and their distinctly Viennese articulation — can be haughty and stubborn; I have seen them outright defy a conductor in rehearsal.

Welser-Möst has not only penetrated the Philharmonic’s inner circle, but also has done so while leading the Cleveland Orchestra — another top-notch ensemble, though one whose sound differs enormously from that of the Viennese.

The main difference between the Cleveland Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic is that while the Clevelanders have been criticized for giving performances that are too good, no one could ever accuse the Viennese of the same.

In Cleveland, Welser-Möst has for the past two decades maintained and deepened the orchestra’s transparent, clean sound. (He will leave his post in 2027.) Its playing is the most precise of any American ensemble, impeccably balanced to the delight of perfectionists and the frustration of those who crave more daring in their concerts.

The Philharmonic is also impressively skilled, but with a touch of messiness that tends to enliven rather than diminish a score. These players are, above all, human: Expressivity pervades their wide tremolos, wailing glissandos and physical gestures that verge on theatrical.

If the Clevelanders like their music lean, the Viennese like it fatty, “mit Schlag.” Together, these orchestras embody two approaches to musical excellence. And able to walk either path with them is Welser-Möst.

At Carnegie, the Philharmonic’s style was at its most pronounced in Bruckner and Mahler’s ninth symphonies — which were fitting inclusions in Welser-Möst’s Perspectives series at the hall, but not in its festival “Fall of the Weimar Republic: Dancing on the Precipice.”

The Weimar Republic, during its short life from 1918 to 1933, was an extraordinary period for all types of art. Audience members at the Philharmonic concerts, though, could barely glean that from its three programs, which only glanced at the era and grasped at thematic relevance. The performances more richly represented the Germanic world inching into modernism on the cusp of World War I, and the disillusioned mood of the war’s aftermath: the decline of Romanticism and the rise of embittered irony.

That idea can overlap with, but is not the same as, the precarity and collapse of the Weimar Republic. And where they met was the Philharmonic’s Saturday program, which opened with Hindemith’s Konzertmusik für Blasorchester, written in 1926 for a military band with the kind of satirical spirit you could hear on the revue stages of Berlin at the time. It was there that Schoenberg’s Variations for Orchestra premiered in 1928, disastrously mishandled by the Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtwängler. But at Carnegie both received easily legible readings; the Schoenberg, played with a comfort that let its underlying expressiveness come through, provided proof that “atonal” doesn’t inherently mean “unpleasant.”

From there, the Philharmonic’s programming trailed away from the Weimar Republic, with works like Ravel’s “La Valse,” first performed not in Germany but in the Paris of 1920; and Strauss’s Symphonic Fantasy from “Die Frau Ohne Schatten,” a 1947 reworking of an opera written before and during World War I.

Which is not to discount the performances of these pieces. The Ravel unfurled like a dreamy memory of the Philharmonic’s famous New Year’s concerts — one that gives way to a nightmare. And the Strauss, difficult to balance with its large scale and dense writing, was an alluringly perfumed stroll through the luxuriant sound world of “Frau.”

Furthest, perhaps, from the Weimar theme was the Bruckner, dedicated to God and left incomplete at the composer’s death in 1896. Welser-Möst likes to play with juxtaposition, and on Friday, he paired it, as something of a finale, with Berg’s Three Pieces for Orchestra, written in the 1910s — Berg’s music bringing Bruckner’s across the threshold of modernity.

Bruckner’s Ninth, discursive and inconclusive, at one point rivaling the mystery and mystical power of Wagner’s “Parsifal,” acquired dramatic shape and cohesion under Welser-Möst. Its introduction began quietly until it escalated to an explosive declaration, and the passages that followed rose and fell like a distress signal, flaring brightly and fading. From silences emerged wisps of melody and balletic delicacy, before more eruptions that left behind softly glowing halos of sound.

There was a similar sense of shape — a wrangling of immensity — in Mahler’s Ninth Symphony, which stood alone on Sunday. Welser-Möst took a brisk tempo, but with vitality rather than impatience, making for a running time of about 75 minutes where some conductors stretch the score to more than 90.

This is a work full of farewells: an allusion to Beethoven’s “Les Adieux” sonata, inscriptions by Mahler of “Leb’ wohl!” and an ending that quietly takes leave while, as Theodor Adorno wrote, looking questioningly into uncertainty.

Welser-Möst’s interpretation was one with much to say on the way out. The first movement developed with defiant freedom before giving way, in later movements, to a ländler, a folk dance particularly popular in Austria, that began with rustic earthiness but ended with a cosmic dance, and, by the finale, a passionate elegy.

That last movement is often performed as a kind of prolonged death. But the direction “ersterbend,” or “dying,” doesn’t appear in the score until the penultimate page, and the Philharmonic players didn’t take a linear journey to arrive there, with swerves of energy from passages of glacial tranquillity. The music wasn’t ready to say goodbye, and after three days, neither were they."

TEHRAN TIMES","Iran warns cooperation with IAEA could halt if E3 triggers 'snapback' mechanism

Iran yesterday warned it may halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if the E3 (UK, France, Germany) triggers the ""snapback"" mechanism to reinstate UN sanctions.

Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi said such a move would undermine diplomacy and prompt a ""special measure"" from Tehran. The warning comes as IAEA inspectors arrived in Iran to oversee refuelling at the Bushehr plant, an activity conducted under a separate Iran-Russia agreement.

Citing its diplomatic sources, Reuters reported that the snapback process is likely to be initiated today.

Gharibabadi said that if the snapback is activated, ""Iran will take a special measure and issue a warning and notification to the UN Security Council. Moreover, such a step would seriously impact our cooperation with the IAEA, which could potentially be suspended.""

Separately, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a hardline lawmaker and member of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said in a TV interview that Iran ""will use all the tools"" at its disposal if the snapback is activated and that if Iran is not prevented from exporting its oil, ""something will definitely happen that other oil is not exported either"".

FM meets MPs to talk IAEA cooperation, 'snapback'

Separately, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee to discuss nuclear talks with the E3 and the snapback mechanism.

He later told reporters that no new cooperation text with the IAEA has been finalised and that the recent entry of IAEA inspectors was solely for the Bushehr plant refuelling, authorised by Iran's Supreme National Security Council.

Papers discuss IAEA presence in Iran

Iranian dailies today discussed the presence of IAEA inspectors in Iran and apparent dissent by hardline MPs over the matter.

Hardline Javan daily warned the inspectors' return ""without any guarantees"" against further attacks strengthens the view that the IAEA is using Bushehr as a ""foot in the door"" for a wider return.

Ultraconservative Keyhan daily condemned the inspectors' return as a ""suspicious presence"" and a ""costly error"". It said that the IAEA has become an ""intelligence arm of the West"" and that any official circumventing parliament's law to allow access would be ""responsible to the Iranian people"".

Conservative Farhikhtegan newspaper noted that while the SNSC's approval made it legal, MPs retain the right to demand reports on whether the conditions for cooperation have been met. But it framed the issue as political rather than technical, insisting that the hardline MPs knew of the visit beforehand.

Online concern as rial value drops

Iranian online users have been discussing a sharp fall in the value of Iran's currency, the rial.

One US dollar was traded for the price of 1,000,500 rials on the open market yesterday, marking at least a 10% drop in the rial's value since the beginning of this week. Concerns about the activation of the snapback mechanism and the return of the UN Security Council sanctions against Iran are said to be the main factor behind the jump.

The Iranian Chamber of Commerce predicted that in an optimistic scenario, the dollar price could be 1,150,000 and in a pessimistic scenario the dollar price could increase to 1,650,000 rials and inflation could reach 90% by the end of 2025.

The conservative Siasat-e Rouz daily said the Chamber of Commerce has ""painted a bleak picture of the future of the economy, but experts believe that such scenarios are more inflammatory than realistic"".

A user by publishing the Iranian Chamber of Commerce prediction chart on X said: ""Previously, a 20% increase per year was scary, but now 20% increase per month has become optimistic for us"".

""When people are getting crushed by the dollar's price, blaming the trigger is just an escape from reality,"" another user said.

One user asked, ""How long should we tolerate this?"" Noting sanctions, war, electricity outages and the dollar price, the user asked if people have a ""right to protest without being called seditionist""."
NYTFEED020240321ek3l002e5,"Long Before Amsterdam’s Coffee Shops, There Were Hallucinogenic Seeds","A nearly 2,000-year-old stash pouch provides the first evidence of the intentional use of a powerful psychedelic plant in Western Europe during the Roman Era.

In 2011, archaeologists in the Netherlands discovered an ancient pit filled with 86,000 animal bones at a Roman-Era farmstead near the city of Utrecht. It fell to Martijn van Haasteren, an archaeozoologist at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, to sort through them.","Deep into the cataloging process, Mr. van Haasteren was cleaning the mud from yet another bone when something unexpected happened: Hundreds of black specks the size of poppy seeds came pouring out from one end.

The specks turned out to be seeds of black henbane, a potently poisonous member of the nightshade family that can be medicinal or hallucinogenic depending on the dosage. The bone — hollowed-out and sealed with a tar plug — was an ancient stash pouch that had kept the seeds safe for some 1,900 years.

Researchers determined that the bone was deposited in the pit somewhere between A.D. 70 and 100 — a time when the Netherlands represented the Roman Empire’s northern border. Parts of the container were smooth, suggesting frequent handling.

This “very special” discovery provides the first definitive evidence that Indigenous people living in such a far-flung Roman province had knowledge of black henbane’s powerful properties, said Maaike Groot, an archaeozoologist at the Free University of Berlin and a co-author of a paper published in the journal Antiquity last month describing the finding.

At the time that the original owner stuffed the container full of seeds, the properties of black henbane were already well known in Rome. Writings by Pliny the Elder and others testify to the medicinal use of black henbane seeds and leaves, but warn that an overindulgence will result in mind-altering effects.

The plant was mostly used during Roman times as an ointment for pain relief, although some sources also reference smoking its seeds or adding its leaves to wine. It seems its psychedelic effects came to the fore in the Middle Ages, when black henbane became associated “with witches and summoning demons,” said Mr. van Haasteren, who is a co-author of the paper.

Whether Roman knowledge of black henbane’s special properties traveled to the empire’s more distant corners — or whether this knowledge might have been developed independently by local communities — has been a difficult question for scholars to answer.

Black henbane has been found at archaeological sites in the Netherlands that date back to the Neolithic Period. But because it is a wild plant that readily grows in the disturbed soil near settlements, experts have been unable to ascertain whether it was used by people or was just part of the environment.

In 2008, for example, archaeologists found a Roman-Era ceramic beaker in Voorburg that had been filled with dirt over time. In the dirt, they found one black henbane seed along with 26 hazelnuts and a single grain each of corn, barley, wheat and various other seeds. “The overall composition of the seeds seemed to point at the intentional use of black henbane as some kind of medicine or hallucinogen,” said Jasper de Bruin, the curator of the “Netherlands in Roman Times” collection at the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, who was not involved in the new research.

However, according to Laura Kooistra, a retired archaeobotanist and a co-author on the latest findings, a single seed embedded in soil does not provide the degree of certainty needed to draw conclusions about whether black henbane was used by people. “One swallow does not make a summer,” she said.

The bone container, on the other hand, does provide that level of smoking-gun evidence. “It shows, for the first time in Western Europe, the deliberate collection of seeds of the poisonous black henbane during the Roman Period,” said Otto Brinkkemper, an archaeobotanist at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, who was not involved in the research.

Experts can only guess, though, what purpose the seeds might have served.

The authors of the new study refer to black henbane as a medicinal plant, said Astrid Van Oyen, an archaeologist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, who was not involved in the research. But it is also possible that black henbane was used by people “actively seeking psychoactive experiences” for spiritual, therapeutic or recreational purposes, she said.

“This find shows us a rare glimpse of a possible way in which people navigated and mediated the anxieties, stresses, hopes and aspirations of daily life,” Dr. Van Oyen said. “Whoever collected all these seeds in this makeshift container did this deliberately and skillfully — they knew what they were doing.”"

For more than eight decades, Ireland’s Constitution has included language enshrining the role of women in the home, which equality advocates have long seen as a relic of a patriarchal past. On Friday, the Irish public will vote on proposals to change that language and to broaden the definition of what constitutes a family.","The voting coincides with International Women’s Day and could be another milestone in a transformative few decades during which Ireland has reshaped its Constitution in ways that reflect the country’s more secular and liberal modern identity.

If passed, the amendments would provide the latest updates to the Constitution, a document originally written in line with the values of the Roman Catholic Church and ratified in 1937, when religion and social conservatism dominated society.

What exactly is the Irish public voting on?

Voters will be asked to consider two separate questions.

The first asks whether the public is in favor of amending Article 41 of the Constitution to provide for a wider concept of family.

At present, the Constitution says: “The state recognizes the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.”

It adds: “The state pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.”

The new language would recognize a family, “whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships” as the fundamental unit of society. The words “on which the family is founded” would be removed from the clause about the state’s responsibility for guarding the institution of marriage.

The second question is about Article 41.2 of the Constitution, which currently says that the state “recognizes that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved” and that the state will “endeavor to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labor to the neglect of their duties in the home.”

If voters choose in favor, the reference to the role of women in the home would be removed. A new Article, 42B, would recognize and protect all family caregivers, saying: “The state recognizes that the provision of care, by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them, gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved, and shall strive to support such provision.”

The amendments would be another sign of a changing country.

The Irish Constitution was written at a time when the influence of the Roman Catholic Church was immense, and language that reflected the church’s social teachings was woven into the national document. It defined women in terms of their role as wives and mothers, and outlined their duties in the home.

The proposed changes would be another signal of Ireland’s move away from being a conservative state rooted in Catholic values — particularly around the role of women. That transformation has happened rapidly. At the start of the 1990s, divorce and gay marriage were illegal, and abortion was outlawed in nearly all cases.

In 1995, Ireland voted to end its ban on divorce, with a later referendum in 2019 further liberalizing divorce laws. In 2015, the country voted to legalize same-sex marriage, and, in 2018, to repeal the amendment that prohibited abortion.

What do those who support the propositions say?

Recent polling by The Irish Times has indicated that a majority of voters intends to approve both proposals. Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, a charity that promotes women’s rights and equality, said in a statement that the changes were a “chance to remove sexist language and limits on women from our Constitution.”

Voting in favor, she said, “will be a long step away from this dark past and a small step toward recognizing the importance of care and the care roles of both women and men.”

She added: “We encourage all voters to really think: Do we want our young women and girls growing up in an Ireland where the Constitution still tells them that their primary place, indeed their ‘life,’ is in the home?” And that they have ‘duties’ and the boys and men don’t?”

Mary McAleese, a former president of Ireland, has campaigned in favor of the proposals. She said she thought that the changes “will reflect the overwhelming impulse for equality and inclusivity that is a hallmark of modern Ireland.”

All of the country’s major political parties have also called for voters to approve the overhaul. Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, speaking to reporters while he was campaigning in Dublin this week, urged the public to vote in favor of both proposals.

“If there is a yes vote, we will be saying as a society that all families are equal and the marital status of parents shouldn’t affect that,” he said, referring to the family question. Regarding the second question, about the role of women, he added: “If there is a no vote, we will have very outdated language in our Constitution that will be there for the foreseeable future. I think that would be really unfortunate.”

What about those opposed?

Catholic bishops in Ireland issued a statement last month saying they believed that the proposed change to the family clause would “lead to a weakening of the incentive for young people to marry.”

They also expressed concern about the removal of the clause about women, saying, “It would have the effect of abolishing all reference to motherhood in the Constitution and leave unacknowledged the particular and incalculable societal contribution that mothers in the home have made and continue to make in Ireland.”

Other critics have argued that the proposed language changes do not go far enough, particularly around the provisions for caregivers, while some have said that the new language is problematic. Free Legal Advice Centres, an independent human rights and equality body, said in a statement that it supported the change to in the first question, the definition of family, but rejected the wording in the second, about caregivers.

The proposed language intended to replace the reference to a women’s duties in the home “endorses a status quo where women undertake the bulk of unpaid care work and places no obligation whatsoever on the state to redress this gender imbalance — rendering it an implicitly sexist amendment,” the group said.

Mr. Varadkar, however, said that those who criticized the measures as not going far enough were missing the point.

“I would very much see these referendums as further progress toward modernizing our Constitution, and incremental change in the right direction,” he said."

NYTFEED020240328ek3s006sh,Outcry in France as Principal Steps Down Over Head Scarf Incident,"A Paris school principal received online death threats after he was involved in an “altercation” with a Muslim student over her head scarf, sparking outrage in a country still scarred by the killing of two teachers.

A Paris school principal’s decision to step down after he received online death threats over an incident involving a Muslim student’s head scarf has prompted national outrage this week in France.","Camera crews have descended on the school and the government said it planned to sue the student, accusing her of making false accusations — the latest flashpoint in a debate over French secularism and the treatment of the country’s Muslim minority.

Officials say the incident occurred on Feb. 28 at the Lycée Maurice-Ravel when the school’s principal asked three students to remove their head scarves on school grounds. Two of the students complied, but a third refused, causing an “altercation,” according to the Paris prosecutor’s office.

Since 2004, middle and high school students in France have been barred from wearing “ostentatious” symbols that have a clear religious meaning, like a Catholic cross, a Jewish skullcap or a Muslim head scarf.

The full details of the altercation are unclear. But the incident quickly drew national attention in France, where the perceived encroachment of Islam in the public school system is an extremely sensitive topic.

The country remains deeply scarred by the killing of two schoolteachers by Islamist extremists in recent years.

The student told investigators that the principal had pushed her and hit her arm, but the Paris prosecutor’s office said that a complaint she had filed accusing the principal of assault had been dropped over a lack of evidence. The principal filed a separate suit accusing the student of intimidating a public official, the prosecutor’s office said.

The government and politicians across the spectrum have defended the principal and disputed the accusations of violence made against him.

French officials have not publicly identified the principal or the student. The regional education authority for Paris said that the student dropped out of the school shortly after the incident.

The controversy began to draw greater national attention last week after the principal decided to step down. In a message to school staff that was shared with the French media, he said he had decided to leave over concerns about his personal safety and the school’s own security.

Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said that the threats against the principal were “unacceptable” and announced on Wednesday that the government would file a legal complaint against the student, accusing her of trying to “intimidate” the principal by making wrongful accusations of violence against him, leading to a wave of online death threats.

“Laïcité is constantly being put to the test,” Mr. Attal told a national television station on Wednesday about the case, referring to France’s version of secularism, which guarantees freedom of conscience but also the strict neutrality of the state and of some public spaces.

The Paris prosecutor’s office said it had opened an investigation into the death threats and “cyber-harassment” faced by the principal. Three people have already been arrested, and one of them will face trial next month, the prosecutor’s office said.

Mr. Attal, who met with the principal on Wednesday, said that the principal was scheduled to retire in June but had decided to step down earlier because of the threats. The prime minister added that the state would be unwavering in its support for “all of those who are on the front lines of these attacks on laïcité.”

In his former position as education minister, Mr. Attal had spearheaded a ban in schools of the abaya, a loosefitting, full-length robe worn by some Muslim women.

Nicole Belloubet, Mr. Attal’s successor at the ministry, visited the school in early March to express support for the principal, and she assured lawmakers this week that he had been given full legal and moral assistance. Police officers were also deployed in front of the school as a precautionary measure after the incident occurred, she said.

In a video published by the Collective for Countering Islamophobia in Europe — a Belgium-based activist group that was created after a similar one was disbanded by the government in France — the student said that the altercation happened as she was leaving school.

Speaking with her face blurred to conceal her identity, the student said that she was starting to cover her head with a hat as she prepared to put on her head scarf when the principal shouted at her to remove it.

Before she could comply, she said, the principal “pushed me violently” and “hit me hard on the arm,” then he tried to drag her to his office until another student intervened, she said.

The Collective for Countering Islamophobia in Europe condemned the death threats against the principal but accused the French government of “fueling a climate of conflict within schools, pitting teachers, pupils and families against each other.”

“We want to reiterate our commitment to the fight against all forms of harassment and discrimination, especially toward Muslim students, who are under undue pressure in the current climate,” the group said in a statement.

For many in France, the case echoed the chain reaction that led to the killing of Samuel Paty in 2020. The history teacher was beheaded in a northwestern suburb of Paris by an Islamist assailant after he showed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to his students in an attempt to illustrate free speech.

Mr. Paty was murdered less than two weeks after a schoolgirl lied about attending his class and made false accusations against him — setting off a spiral of online rumors that ultimately put the killer on his trail.

The killing last year of Dominique Bernard, a French literature teacher who was stabbed to death at a high school in northern France by a radicalized former student, put the country further on edge.

In an interview with French television on Thursday, Mickaëlle Paty, Mr. Paty’s sister, praised the government’s swift reaction to the incident at Lycée Maurice-Ravel. But Ms. Paty, who wants the government to be held responsible for failing to protect her brother, said there was still a “lack of awareness” of the threats faced by teachers.

A French Senate report published this month found there was a worrying rise of insults, threats and physical violence against teachers over the past few years, and it urged the government to increase security and schools and to make it easier for staff to flag worrying incidents to the Education Ministry.

A lone camera crew was still lingering in front of the school on Thursday, but the atmosphere was calm. Several students said that they had not witnessed the incident themselves, but were taken aback by the national attention it had received and the rumors it had spawned.

“The rules are the rules, we all signed them at the beginning of the year: it says the head scarf is banned inside the school,” said Yacine Kone, 16. But, she added, the principal “shouldn’t put his hand on a student, even if it’s just to touch her.”

Ralph Modisa, 15, said the principal had a good reputation with students. “People are getting a bit too fired up over nothing,” he added.

NYTFEED020240327ek3r001rx,Thailand Lawmakers Bring Same-Sex Marriage a Crucial Step Closer,"The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage. The bill now goes to Thailand’s Senate.

Thailand’s House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, bringing the measure a significant step closer to becoming law.","The bill passed by 400 votes to 10, with a handful of abstentions, and now the legislation goes to the Senate. If it passes there, and if Thailand’s king approves it, the country will become the first in Southeast Asia to recognize same-sex marriages. In Asia more broadly, only Taiwan and Nepal have done so.

Thailand’s bill describes marriage as a partnership between two individuals, rather than between a woman and a man. It will also give L.G.B.T.Q. couples equal rights to various tax savings, the ability to inherit property and the power to give medical treatment consent for partners who are incapacitated. The draft will also grant adoption rights. Thai law currently allows only heterosexual couples to adopt, although single women can adopt children with special needs.

“The amendment of this law is for all Thai people. It is the starting point to create equality,” Danuphorn Punnakanta, a lawmaker who chairs the lower house’s committee on marriage equality, told Parliament. “We understand that this law is not a universal cure to every problem, but at least it’s the first step toward equality in Thai society.”

The legislation has been more than a decade in the making, with obstacles stemming from political upheaval and disagreements as to the approach to take and what to include in the bill. In December, Parliament passed four proposed draft bills on same-sex marriage; one was put forward by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s administration, and three additional versions by the Move Forward Party, the Democrat Party and the civil sector were considered. These four were combined into a single draft that was passed on Wednesday.

“This is the greatest victory,” said Nada Chaiyajit, a law lecturer at Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, who has supported the law from its beginnings. “We have been working hard with the committee. This is not only about L.G.B.T.I.Q., this is about everyone. Equality.”

Thailand is one of the most open places in the world for L.G.B.T.Q. people, though some elements of its Buddhist-dominated culture are socially conservative."

NYTFEED020240309ek39002mh,Russia’s Advance Around Avdiivka Loses Momentum After Quick Gains,"Ukraine has committed significant forces to defending the area, and Russian troops are now attacking across open fields with little cover.

When the eastern city of Avdiivka, a Ukrainian stronghold, fell to Russian forces three weeks ago, Kyiv and its allies feared that Moscow’s troops could build on their momentum and quickly press ahead toward strategic military hubs and population centers.","But after making rapid gains in the subsequent days, Russian assaults have stalled around three contested nearby villages. Military experts cite several factors, including terrain that does not favor offensive operations, Russian troops exhausted by months of fighting and a Ukrainian army that has committed significant forces to defending the area.

Russia seems to be maintaining its initiative on the battlefield, and military analysts say its forces could still break through Ukrainian lines in the near future, especially since Kyiv’s defensive efforts are increasingly curtailed by the absence of further American military aid.

Yet for now, they say the fighting appears to have reverted to the kind of inconclusive back-and-forth battles that have characterized much of the war’s front line combat this past year.

“The capture of Avdiivka has not led to the collapse of Ukrainian lines, the possibility for the Russians to move onto open ground or even to make major gains,” said Thibault Fouillet, the deputy director of the Institute for Strategic and Defense Studies, a French research center. “There’s no decisive action or breakthrough.”

It’s a contrast to the situation that emerged from the fall of Avdiivka in mid-February. At that time, as Ukraine’s forces retreated, Russia advanced rapidly, aided in part by the absence of strong Ukrainian defensive positions. Russian troops captured three settlements and took control of nine square miles of land, according to open-source maps of the battlefield.

But in the past 10 days, Moscow has captured only a little over a square mile of land, according to the open-source maps. Its soldiers have been caught up in fighting in and around the villages of Berdychi, Orlivka and Tonenke.

Russian forces “seem to be attempting to push forward using small infantry assault groups, but are being decimated in the relatively open terrain west of Avdiivka,” said Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, a Finland-based open-source community that assesses satellite imagery and social media content from the battlefield.

The recent fighting has also come at a cost to the Ukrainian army, which appears to have now committed some of its best troops and weapons to the fight in the area west of Avdiivka.

Its 47th Brigade, which the United States trained and equipped last year, has been defending Berdychi. A video released by Ukraine’s defense ministry purported to show the brigade using an American-made Abrams tank, one of the United States’ most advanced.

The Ukrainian army “is allocating all possible weapons” to the fight outside Avdiivka, said Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group.

But three of Ukraine’s Abrams tanks have been destroyed or damaged and abandoned there in the past two weeks, according to Oryx, a military analysis website that counts losses based on visual evidence.

Ukrainian forces also suffered heavy losses as they fought off Russian assaults on Avdiivka for months.

Military experts say that Ukraine’s continued defense in the area is likely intended to give its units time to prepare and reinforce new defensive lines further west. The Ukrainian army recently published photos of fortifications that it said it was building near the Avdiivka battle zone, including 6.5-foot-deep trenches and anti-tank ditches.

“You’ve got a stronghold that’s fallen,” Mr. Fouillet said, referring to Avdiivka, “so you need time to put a defensive line back in place.”

Russia’s assault on Avdiivka resulted in heavy human and material losses for its forces. British military intelligence said that the average daily number of Russian troops killed and wounded in February, when Moscow was devoting a large number of forces to the fight for Avdiivka, had reached 983, “the highest rate since the start of the war.”

Mr. Paroinen and Mr. Kuzan noted that Ukraine’s forces have benefited from the area’s terrain. While Russian troops have been attacking Berdychi, Orlivka and Tonenke through open fields with little cover, Ukrainian units hold the high ground in the villages, making it easier to target approaching Russian soldiers.

Should Russian troops eventually capture the three villages, it is unclear what their exact next steps would be, given that the terrain is hilly and dotted with streams and reservoirs, complicating further advances.

Mr. Kuzan said that Russia’s army was currently attacking multiple places all along the more than 600-mile front line to probe Ukraine’s defenses.

“Which of them will be prioritized, for example, in two days or next week, will depend on how well they succeed in pushing through our defense,” he said. “Where they succeed in pushing through, they will deploy additional reserves to build on their success. This is their strategy.”"
NYTFEED020240319ek3j0028w,Senegal Election 2024: What You Need to Know,"Senegal was seen as an outpost of democracy in a coup-plagued region until its president tried to cancel the election last month. He failed, and it’s going ahead next Sunday.

* Why does this election matter?","* Who is running?

* What are the main issues?

* When will the results be released?

* Who is likely to win?

* Where to find more information?

* What other elections are happening?

Why does this election matter?

It should have been one of Africa’s more boring polls.

Senegal, with a ticking economy, is seen as a stable, safe country — no small feat in western Africa, where coups, crises and insurgencies abound. A president regarded as a steady hand is stepping down after two terms. A pool of candidates is taken mainly from the political old guard.

But then the president, Macky Sall, blew up any chance of a mundane election. He went on state television and canceled the vote, alleging corruption in the way candidates were approved by constitutional court.

In the uproar that followed, Mr. Sall backtracked and said that the vote would go ahead on March 24, nine days before his term ends. And then, in a dramatic move, he released the leading opposition candidate and the leader of the opposition party from prison.

Who is running?

The governing party’s candidate is Amadou Ba, a former prime minister. The man many see as the main challenger, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, was just released from jail. He’s backed by a popular but divisive politician, Ousmane Sonko. Then there are 17 other candidates, among them former mayors and prime ministers.

But what’s more important is who’s not running. That would be Mr. Sonko, who cannot take part because he was convicted of corrupting a minor, in a scandal involving a young massage parlor employee who accused him of rape. Mr. Sonko is Mr. Sall’s main opponent, a (relatively) young former tax inspector who has dominated politics in Senegal recently, mainly by criticizing elites and promising to help Senegal’s jobless youth.

Mr. Sonko has many critics. But many young Senegalese say he speaks truth to power, and they have repeatedly taken to the streets in his defense despite the risk of death at the hands of the police. Along with Mr. Faye, he was released from jail on Thursday night.

The other important person unable to run is Karim Wade, son of former President Abdoulaye Wade, who tried to cling to power in 2012 but was defeated by Mr. Sall. The younger Mr. Wade, who is French-Senegalese, is barred from running because he had not renounced his French citizenship when he submitted his candidacy. That’s what started the whole ruckus and led to Mr. Sall’s canceling the election in the first place.

What are the main issues?

The economy is a big one — most Senegalese say that the economic situation is bad and that managing it is the most important problem facing the government, according to Afrobarometer, an independent research network. The economy is growing, but more than 36 percent of people live in poverty.

Nearly a third of young people are out of work, and many have set their sights on getting to Europe or America to try to improve their prospects. Thousands take boats to the Canary Islands, perilous desert roads toward the Mediterranean or, most recently, circuitous routes by plane, bus or foot to Central America.

When will the results be released?

Results from the first round should emerge about a week after the election next Sunday, but many analysts expect a runoff. The last time that happened, the runoff took place about a month after the first round. Mr. Sall says he’ll leave office by April 2, and if there’s a runoff, the constitutional council says, the head of the national assembly, Amadou Mame Diop, should take over in the interim.

Who is likely to win?

Almost certainly a former tax inspector. Mr. Ba, who resigned as prime minister to focus on what must be one of the shortest political campaigns, is a former tax inspector. So is Mr. Faye, who is not well known but stands a good chance of winning simply because he was anointed by Mr. Sonko.

Neither Mr. Ba nor Mr. Faye is particularly beloved in Senegal, and neither is expected to win in a landslide. But if the election goes to a runoff, many analysts say it’ll be a choice between the two.

Six killed, 86 wounded in Israeli strikes on Yemen","Six people have been reported killed and 86 others injured following intense Israeli bombardment of Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa yesterday afternoon.

Rescue teams are still searching for the missing and identifying missing persons, Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported this morning, following the strikes which struck the presidential palace complex, energy facilities and power stations.

The Israeli army said that the strikes were carried out ""in response to repeated attacks"" by the Houthis against Israel.

On 22 August, the Iran-backed Houthi group claimed three attacks on Israel, including one on the country's main international airport.

Speaking to Qatar's Al Jazeera yesterday afternoon, Houthi political bureau member Hezam al-Assad said that ""it pains us as we see our children, women and men in Gaza starving or their limbs and blood scattered"", while vowing to continue targeting Israel until the siege is lifted and the war ends there.

Pan-Arab media split focus on Israeli strikes on Yemen

Key pan-Arab media outlets have taken different approaches in their coverage of yesterday's Israeli strikes on the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.

Al Jazeera website highlighted in a report yesterday that the strikes ""did not deter the Houthis"". It interviewed the deputy media chief of the Houthi group, Nasr al-Din Amer, who denied reports of a security or intelligence breach of the group.

Meanwhile, the UAE-based Sky News Arabia website cited Israeli statements in two reports, including statements by the Israeli prime minister and others by the Israeli army on the targets it hit in Yemen.

The Saudi-funded Al Arabiya website provided limited coverage of the Israeli strikes, highlighting figures released by the ""health ministry affiliated with the Houthis"" of the Yemeni casualties.

Saudi pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat described the Israeli strikes as ""retaliatory"".

Palestinian factions condemn Israeli strikes on Yemen

Several Palestinian armed groups have condemned the Israeli strikes on Sanaa yesterday.

Hamas said in a Telegram statement that the strikes ""constitute a blatant violation of Arab states' sovereignty and international law"".

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the strikes were ""coordinated with the US"", describing them as ""a failed attempt to subjugate Yemen and halt Yemeni special operations deep inside the Zionist entity"".

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) also said that the strikes were conducted ""with full encouragement and support from the US"".

The Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) said that ""the barbaric Zionist attack on Arab and Islamic Yemen exposes the magnitude of the crisis facing the Zionist entity due to the ongoing Yemeni missile strikes"".

Israeli army chief urges Netanyahu to take hostage deal

Israeli media highlighted yesterday that the army Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and senior military officers had urged the political leadership to prioritise a hostage release deal, even if partial, over further military actions in Gaza.

The daily Haaretz reported that Zamir's position is that additional pressure on Hamas in the form of occupying Gaza City would take a long time, result in casualties among both soldiers and hostages, and further strain the ""already heavy burden"" placed on the military reserve system.

The report added that the military leadership criticised the government for not leveraging the army's achievements to secure a hostage release deal.

The Ynet news site reported that Hamas is still awaiting an official Israeli response, while Zamir's message to the political leadership is clear.

Ynet reported that the Hostages' Families Headquarters urged the government to take the deal.

The report added that despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive to launch immediate negotiations, no progress has been made.

Syria postpones elections in three provinces citing security concerns

Syria announced the postponement of parliamentary elections in three provinces, citing security concerns, domestic media reported on 23 August.

The Higher Committee for the Elections of the People's Assembly released a statement saying: ""In order to ensure fair representation in the People's Assembly for the three Syrian governorates (Suweida, Hasaka, and Raqqa), and in view of the security challenges facing these governorates, the Higher Committee has decided to postpone the electoral process… until the appropriate conditions and a safe environment are available"", state news agency Sana reported.

Deadly violence in the southern restive province of Suweida last month between Druze and Bedouin fighters led to government intervention, while clashes were also reported between defence ministry forces and Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria.

Pan-Arab media report on Syria-Israel talks

Pan-Arab media focused on the prospect of direct talks between Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next month in New York, with UAE-owned Sky News Arabia reporting this morning that the US was spearheading the efforts.

The channel said that it followed positive developments from recent talks between Syrian and Israeli delegations in Paris organised by US envoy Thomas Barrack. It said that Syrian demands of a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement and Israel's demand to remain in certain strategic points in the tri-border Jabal al-Sheikh (Mount Hermon) area were still hampering a breakthrough in the talks.

Sharaa confirmed last night that talks with Israel were progressing, telling Sky News: ""If a peace agreement serves the interests of Syria and the Syrian people, I will not hesitate to choose that option.""

UN to vote on renewal of Lebanon peacekeeping force

The UN Security Council votes today to renew the mandate of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) for another year, while they work toward a gradual withdrawal, to enable the disarmament of Hezbollah, the full implementation of Resolution 1701 and to allow the army to deploy fully along the border with Israel. Unifil's mandate expires at the end of August otherwise.

Lebanon has continued to reiterate that it wishes for the peacekeeping mission to remain for at least two-three more years, French-language daily L'Orient-Le Jour reported last night.

Security in the south remains uncertain as Hezbollah opposes forced disarmament against a backdrop of a weak Lebanese army and Israel's continued attacks across the country, violating a ceasefire it signed with Hezbollah in November.

UAE brokers new Russia-Ukraine POW swap

The UAE has announced the success of mediation efforts in a new exchange of prisoners of war (POWs) between Russia and Ukraine.

The agency said the UAE, as a ""trusted mediator"", succeeded in mediating in 17 deals between Russia and Ukraine with a total number of 4,641 freed POWs.

It stressed the UAE's commitment to ensuring the success of all efforts aimed at achieving a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine and alleviating the humanitarian consequences of the crisis.

Later in the evening, the aide posted a photograph of Mr. Volkov being loaded into an ambulance and taken to the hospital.

“He began to fight back with the car door and with his legs,” Ms. Yarmysh told the exiled Russian news outlet Meduza. “Therefore, they hit him where they could — on his legs.”

The identity of those behind the assault was unknown as of Tuesday night, and it was not immediately clear whether there was one attacker, or more.

The assault on Mr. Volkov happened nearly a month after Mr. Navalny’s death in prison, in circumstances that have not yet been explained.

The opposition campaigner’s wife and aides accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of murdering Mr. Navalny. President Biden said Mr. Putin “and his thugs” were responsible for his death. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. The Russian prison service said Mr. Navalny had collapsed while taking a walk outside his cell.

The attack Tuesday night comes amid broader worries about the safety of those continuing Mr. Navalny’s work from abroad. Hours before the attack, Mr. Volkov was asked in an interview with Meduza about the main risks for Mr. Navalny’s organization. He replied: “The key risk is that we will all be killed.”

Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian journalist who exposed the Russian intelligence unit behind a 2020 poisoning of Mr. Navalny in an investigation featured in the Oscar-winning documentary “Navalny,” issued a warning in Russian on X after the attack on Mr. Volkov. “The great terror of a small dictator has begun,” Mr. Grozev said. “Activists, journalists and simply free-thinking people — be careful. Don’t be afraid, but be careful. Don’t make things easier for brainless bandits.”

The Lithuanian police confirmed that a Russian citizen, whom they did not name, was beaten outside his home in Vilnius shortly after 10 p.m. local time, according to the Baltic news outlet Delfi.

“News about Leonid’s assault are shocking. Relevant authorities are at work,” Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s minister of foreign affairs, said in a statement on X. “Perpetrators will have to answer for their crime.”

Mr. Volkov, a former software-company executive who ran Mr. Navalny’s nationwide network of regional offices in Russia, fled to Lithuania in 2019, as Russian authorities cracked down on Mr. Navalny’s anticorruption organization and opened criminal cases against his aides.

In recent days, Mr. Volkov had been leading calls for “Noon Against Putin,” a plan for Russians who oppose the president to show up together at the country’s polls at 12 p.m. on the last day of this weekend’s presidential election.

Before his death, Mr. Navalny had supported the idea as a way for Russians to register resistance without risking arrest. Mr. Volkov has called on Russians to execute the plan as a way to honor the opposition leader’s last wishes."
NYTFEED020240304ek34001jr,"As ‘Zombie Fires’ Smolder, Canada Braces for Another Season of Flames","A government forecast suggests that there could be even more wildfires this season than during last year’s exceptional fire period.

Canada’s emergency preparedness minister is warning that this year’s wildfire season will be worse than the record-breaking season of 2023, when thousands of fires burned tens of millions of acres and set off massive plumes of smoke that enveloped major U.S. cities, including New York and Washington.","This year’s fires could be especially bad in two of the country’s most fire-prone provinces, where nearly 150 of the blazes that started during last year’s season are still burning this winter, under snow-covered ground.

While so-called “zombie fires,” a term recently popularized in the Canadian media, are an annual phenomenon in parts of the country, never have so many fires been reported in a single winter, raising fears that many of them may flare up again above ground.

The “zombie fires” persist during winter because porous peat and moss ground cover in northern areas act as underground fuel for them.

The risk of wildfire in Canada has grown because of climate change, which increases the hot, dry and gusty conditions that have caused drought, according to research published last summer by World Weather Attribution, a group of scientists who model how climate change impacts extreme weather.

Given drought conditions in parts of Western Canada and other extreme weather effects, Harjit Sajjan, Canada’s emergency preparedness minister, said it was not surprising that the wildfire forecast was “alarming.”

He added that climate change “is the reality that we face and we need to get ready for it.”

Many of the underground fires — which are burning in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta — don’t pose an increased risk of triggering wildfires in the spring because they are in places so charred that there is no vegetation left to burn.

But others are in areas that droughts have turned into tinder boxes, prompting fears that they will cause fires to erupt above ground once spring arrives.

Last year’s wildfires burned about 48 million acres of forest across Canada, an area roughly the size of Finland, and a staggering increase of 170 percent over the previous year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center.

Smoke from the fires, particularly blazes that burned in Quebec, wafted as far south as Florida and blanketed several cities in the United States and southern Canada in a noxious cloud.

The drought in Western Canada is now entering its third year and is a major factor behind fears of an even worse 2024 fire season, particularly in British Columbia and Alberta.

Both provinces have already seen new aboveground wildfires this year, prompting Alberta to declare a start to its wildfire season about a week before the traditional March 1 start date.

Snow could still fall in the spring and tame the existing fires and help with the dry conditions, said Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildfire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia.

But this year, he added, long-range forecasts suggest continued dryness and warmer than usual temperatures.

About 93 fires left over from last year have continued to burn underground through the winter in British Columbia, while 55 are burning in Alberta, according to their provincial governments.

Such winter fires are common in both provinces, as well as in Yukon, but, in British Columbia, there are usually no more than about 15, experts said, adding that this year’s much higher tally has left them surprised and worried.

“There’s no historical analog to what we’re seeing right now,” Professor Flannigan said. “Most years they’re not a big deal. But now a lot of these fires have the potential that when the snow melts and it gets warm, dry and windy to actually grow again. So it is a serious issue.”

No overwinter fires have been recorded in the forests of Quebec, the eastern province that sent smoke billowing into the United States and at one point across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Quebec generally lacks the peat and moss soil of the western provinces that serve as fuel for winter fires.

Since the winter fires are underground and can produce little or no visible smoke, tracking them can be a challenge. The wildfire service for British Columbia said that it relied on sensors in airplanes and satellites to look for heat, though snow cover reduces their effectiveness.

Still, some fires have been visible to the naked eye.

“Even on the -40, -42 Celsius days, we were still seeing smoke,’’ said Sonja E.R. Leverkus, the senior fire lead at Northern Fire Worx, a private wildfire fighting service in a remote section of northeastern British Columbia. “So much that as you drove you’d be smelling the smoke and coughing in your truck.”

In a typical year, melting snow seeps into the ground where winter fires burn and snuffs most of them out. But this year there has been far less snow than usual, said Dr. Leverkus, who holds a doctorate in fire ecology.

“I am 6 foot 2, and there have been times in the past few years that snow on my apple orchard has been well above my hips,” she said, adding that there was less than a foot on the ground.

Mr. Sajjan, the emergency preparedness minister, said that Canada was better prepared this year to fight fires and evacuate communities. While provinces and territories are responsible for fighting fires, federal money has provided for the training of an additional 600 firefighters across the country.

A system meant to allow provinces to share personnel and equipment has been revamped to make it more efficient and accelerate the exchange of information, Mr. Sajjan said.

Equipment stocks have been increased, he added, and new techniques and technologies — including nighttime firefighting — are being introduced or tested.

While the forecast for this year’s wildfire season seems dire, Professor Flannigan stressed that it was still only a prediction.

“I don’t expect to see another year like 2023 in my lifetime, but I could be wrong,” he said.

Still, he added, the long-term outlook for Canada was discouraging.

“Most every year is going to be a bad fire year,” Professor Flannigan said. “But on average, we’re going to see a lot more fire, a lot more smoke. This trend is going to continue.”

In Fort Nelson, British Columbia, Dr. Leverkus, whose crew numbers over 100 at the peak of fire season, said she was still haunted by the eight deaths among firefighters in Canada last year. Two of them occurred in areas near where her crews were working.

“Last year was horrible,” she said. “My crew and I, we listen to what the land is telling us. And the land is telling us that it’s dry, and the animals are telling us that it’s dry and to be ready.”

NYTFEED020240325ek3p004jx,Uplifting Tales of Black Masculinity on London Stages,"“For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy” and “Red Pitch” offer generous portrayals of male bonding.

If you believe the Op-Eds, men are in a bad way these days: perpetually beleaguered and isolated, if not irredeemably toxic. But two lively new plays in London suggest an alternative, sanguine vision of 21st-century masculinity, foregrounding generous portrayals of male bonding and togetherness.","In “For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy,” six Black British men participate in a group-therapy session punctuated by bursts of song. The show, written and directed by Ryan Calais Cameron, is a male-centric spin on Ntozake Shange’s 1976 work, “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf,” in which women of color recount their experiences of racism and gendered violence through performance poetry, music and dance.

“For Black Boys” runs at the Garrick Theater in the West End through June 1. On a stage decked out in bright, blocky primary colors like a pop music video, the men — called Onyx, Pitch, Jet, Sable, Obsidian and Midnight, each a shade of black — bare their souls one by one. Every so often they morph into a ’90-style boy band, delivering neatly choreographed, crowd-pleasing renditions of R&B classics like Blackstreet’s “No Diggity” and India.Arie’s “Brown Skin.” (The set design is by Anna Reid, the choreography by Theophilus O. Bailey.)

Banter is their love language. Jet (an engagingly plaintive Fela Lufadeju) is joshed for wearing chinos — a “white” affectation — prompting a spiky discussion on the vexed subject of “acting Black.” Gradually, deflection and bravado give way to introspection and insight as the men unpack the perniciousness of machismo in their lives: Jet recalls how his father refused to seek cancer treatment for fear of appearing unmanly; Sable, a self-styled Casanova (Albert Magashi, suitably strutting) concedes that insecurity might be driving his philandering ways; a flashback scene depicts Obsidian (Mohammed Mansaray) reluctantly engaging in senseless violence for street cred, with life-changing consequences.

The play ends with an upbeat mantra about keeping your chin up in the face of adversity. Its core message is about collective solidarity: By embracing emotional vulnerability and opening up to one another, young men can build support systems that will help them overcome life’s hardships. And the audience’s enthusiasm at the curtain call suggested to a sense of recognition: These sentiments rang true, and it meant something to see them conveyed from a West End stage.

But that easy accessibility comes at a price. The six characters feel like stock types, their respective travails a little too generic to be truly compelling — each existing, rather like pictures in a high-school textbook, to illustrate a trope. This is echoed in dialogue that relies heavily on melodramatic cliché (one character tells us his father was “destructive like a wrecking ball and I was the collateral damage”) and lingo taken from social sciences (“We’re not monoliths!”). Despite its exuberant energy, “For Black Boys” is ultimately somewhat two-dimensional.

Just around the corner at @sohoplace, through May 4, “Red Pitch,” written by Tyrell Williams and directed by Daniel Bailey, tells a touching story of three 16-year-old aspiring soccer players from a London housing project. As they train for an upcoming, once-in-a-lifetime tryout with a professional club, the trio engage in the daft patter peculiar to adolescence: a fizzing, complex mix of insecurity, aggression and fraternal tenderness.

Bilal (Kedar Williams-Stirling) is ambitious and driven. Omz (Francis Lovehall) is hotheaded, prone to self-sabotage; he is often unlikable, but his flaws are all too human. The goalkeeper Joey (Emeka Sesay) has the funniest stage presence of the three, whether delivering wry quips, demonstratively folding and unfolding his arms, or slipping into his father’s Nigerian accent when he’s getting worked up. The boys’ teenage mannerisms — the moody sulks and flounces, the primal urgency with which they scoff snacks — are affectionately played for laughs.

A municipal soccer pitch takes up the whole stage in Amelia Jane Hankin’s pleasing set. In contrast to another recent London soccer play, “Dear England,” where the sports choreography was less than convincing, the cast here is at ease performing sprints and passing drills. A series of dream sequences in which the boys imagine future sporting glory are strikingly rendered by spotlights, audiovisual effects conjuring camera flashes and the roar of a crowd, and the actors’ slow-motion movements. (The lighting is by Ali Hunter, the sound by Khalil Madovi.)

The poignancy of “Red Pitch” derives from the near-impossibility of a happy ending: In an ultracompetitive field, the three friends won’t all be signed by the club, and seem destined to go their separate ways. We are catching them at a specific, fleeting moment in time, on the threshold of the next phase of life. The line between sentimentality and schmaltz can be fine, but Williams’s taut script treads it nimbly. (The play’s running time is exactly 90 minutes, the length of a regulation soccer match — a nice touch.)

“For Black Boys” and “Red Pitch” are both earnest, uplifting evocations of male camaraderie by emerging British playwrights; both also achieved notable word-of-mouth success during runs in small theaters before transferring to the West End. But they showcase markedly different storytelling styles: “For Black Boys,” with its didactic enumeration of societal ills, has the feel of a PowerPoint presentation; its bracing directness befits the urgency of its message, but as a piece of art it never quite transports us. By contrast, “Red Pitch” draws us in with an absorbing — if conventional linear — narrative, and wears its wisdom lightly. The first is mere performance, the latter true theater."
NYTFEED020240322ek3m0012y,"What to Know About Holi, India’s Most Colorful Tradition","The ancient festival has Hindu roots, but growing numbers worldwide are taking part in the celebration, which features bonfires, singing, dancing, prayer, feasting and clouds of pigmented powder.

A rainbow haze swirls through India, where raucous laughter rings out as friends and strangers douse one another with fists full of pigmented powder. It is time for the ancient Hindu tradition of Holi, an annual celebration of spring.","In 2024, crimson, emerald, indigo and saffron clouds will hover over the country on March 25 for one of its most vibrant, joyful and colorful festivals.

“Playing Holi,” as Indians say, has spread far beyond India’s borders.

The revelry starts at sundown.

Holi (pronounced “holy”), also known as the “festival of colors,” starts on the evening of the full moon during the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around February or March.

It begins with the kindling of bonfires. People gather around the flames to sing, dance and pray for an evening ritual called Holika Dahan, which re-enacts the demise of a Hindu demoness, Holika.

All sorts of things are thrown into the fires, like wood, leaves and food, in a symbolic purge of evil and triumph of good.

From Delhi, Archie Singhal, 24, visits her family in Gujarat the day before Holi, when the fire is lit in the evening. The next morning, she prepares for the bursts of powder, called gulal, by applying oil on her body so the colors don’t stick to her skin. She puts on old clothes she doesn’t mind tossing.

Why the colors?

Holi’s roots are in Hinduism. The god Krishna, cursed by a demon with blue skin, complained to his mother, asking why his love interest Radha is fair while he is not. His mother, Yashoda, playfully suggests that he paint Radha’s face with any colors he wishes. So Krishna smears color on her so they look alike.

Holi is in part a celebration of the love between Krishna and Radha that looks past differences. Today, some of the gulal used during Holi is synthetic. But the colors traditionally come from natural ingredients, such as dried flowers, turmeric, dried leaves, grapes, berries, beetroot and tea.

“There is an environment of freedom,” Ms. Singhal said, adding that she doesn’t hesitate to throw colors on her younger brother, parents, aunts, uncles and neighbors.

Everyone takes part.

The ancient Hindu festival eschews the religious, societal, caste and political divisions that underpin India’s often sectarian society. Hindu or not, anybody can be splashed with brightly colored dust, or even eggs and beer.

Some partake in worship, called puja, offering prayers to the gods. For others, Holi is a celebration of community. The festival gets everyone involved — including innocent passers-by.

“People forget their misunderstandings or enmity during this occasion and again become friends,” said Ratikanta Singh, 63, who writes, sometimes about Holi, in Assam, in northeastern India.

There’s a feast.

When not throwing around gulal, friends, families and neighbors partake in a buffet of traditional dishes and drinks. They include gujiya, dumpling-like fried sweets filled with dried fruits and nuts; dahi vada, deep-fried lentil fritters served with yogurt; and kanji, a traditional drink made by fermenting carrots in water and spices.

Some celebrate Holi with thandai, a light green concoction of milk, rose petals, cardamom, almonds, fennel seeds and other ingredients. For thousands of years, the drink has sometimes been laced with bhang, or crushed marijuana leaves, which add to the mood of revelry.

Holi has ancient roots.

Holi has been documented for centuries in Hindu texts. The tradition is observed by people young and old, particularly in Northern India and Nepal, where the stories behind the festival originated.

Holi also marks the harvesting of crops with the arrival of spring in India, where more than half of the population lives in rural areas.

Traditions vary across India.

Holi celebrations are as diverse as the Indian subcontinent. They are particularly wild in North India, considered the birthplace of the Hindu god Krishna, where celebrations can last more than a week.

In Mathura, a northern city where Krishna is said to have been born, people recreate a Hindu story in which Krishna visits Radha to romance her, and her cowherd friends, taking offense at his advances, drive him out with sticks.

In the eastern state of Odisha, people hold a dayslong festival called Dola Purnima. Grand processions of people shouldering richly decorated carriages with idols of Hindu gods are a large part of the festivities there. The processions are full of drumbeats, songs, colorful powder and flower petals thrown into the air.

In southern India, where Holi is not celebrated as widely, many temples carry out religious rites. In the Kudumbi tribal community, in the southwest, temples cut areca palms and transport their trunks to the shrine in a ritual that symbolizes the victory good over evil.

It’s not just in India.

Holi is celebrated around the world, wherever the Indian diaspora has gone. More than 32 million Indians and people of Indian origin are overseas, most in the United States, where 4.4 million reside, according to the Indian government.

It is also widely enjoyed in countries as varied as Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Britain and other parts of Europe.

Holi is known as Phagwah in the Indian communities of the Caribbean, including in Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.

The festival has also been used by the Indian government to project soft power and reshape its image as part of its “Incredible India” tourism campaign.

On Holi, “the world is a global village,” said Shubham Sachdeva, 29, from an eastern Delhi suburb, who added that his friends in the United States were celebrating Holi with their roommates whether they were Indian or not. “All this brings the world close to each other.”"
NYTFEED020240310ek3a002jp,"In general-election mode, Trump and Biden escalate attacks in Georgia.","President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump traded sharp attacks in dueling campaign events in Georgia on Saturday, essentially using the battleground state to kick off what seems destined to be a bitter general-election contest.

The visits — with Mr. Trump in Rome, Ga., and Mr. Biden in Atlanta — punctuated a frenzied week for the rivals, who solidified their hold on their parties’ nominations by all but sweeping the more than a dozen contests on Super Tuesday. And they came less than 48 hours after Mr. Biden repeatedly criticized his predecessor in his State of the Union address.","During that address, the president skirmished with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, over the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia, who, the authorities say, was killed by an undocumented immigrant with a criminal history. Ms. Riley’s killing has become a cause célèbre for Republican critics of Mr. Biden’s handling of the southern border, and the president told MSNBC on Saturday that he regretted having referred to the suspect as “an illegal” during the State of the Union.

Before taking the stage at his rally in Rome, Mr. Trump met with Ms. Riley’s parents, and his campaign distributed signs with Ms. Riley’s photograph. In his speech, Mr. Trump described the continuing surge of migrants across the border as “the agony of our people, the plunder of our cities, the sacking of our towns, the violation of our citizens and the conquest of our country.” He also welcomed Ms. Greene onstage. Rome is in her district, in a deeply conservative area in the northwestern part of the state.

Mr. Biden, for his part, assailed Mr. Trump at his rally in Atlanta over his alliance with Ms. Greene and his hosting of Viktor Orban on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida. Mr. Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has been widely condemned for his attacks on democratic norms.

“It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with,” Mr. Biden said, adding of Mr. Trump: “When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him.”

In the meantime, the president continues to face anger over his handling of the war in Gaza. At the event on Saturday, a pro-Palestine protester shouted over the president a few minutes into his speech before being removed.

Mr. Biden acknowledged the discontent during his interview with MSNBC, criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for the rising civilian death toll but saying that there was “no red line” for Israel that would prompt the United States to “cut off all weapons so they don’t have the iron dome to protect them.”"

NYTFEED020240318ek3i0005l,Five Takeaways From Putin’s Orchestrated Win in Russia,"President Vladimir V. Putin is expected to use the scale of his victory to justify more aggression in Ukraine. Many Russians are uneasy about what comes next.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia emerged from the three-day, stage-managed presidential vote that ended Sunday declaring that his overwhelming win represented a public mandate to act as needed in the war in Ukraine as well as on various domestic matters, feeding unease among Russians about what comes next.","Mr. Putin said the vote represented a desire for “internal consolidation” that would allow Russia to “act effectively at the front line” as well as in other spheres, such as the economy.

The government was dismissive of a protest organized by Russia’s beleaguered opposition, in which people expressed dissent by flooding polling places at noon. A correspondent for the state-run Rossiya 24 channel said that “provocations at polling stations were nothing more than mosquito bites.” Official commentators suggested that the lines showed a zeal for democratic participation.

Mr. Putin, 71, will now be president until at least 2030, entering a fifth term in a country whose Constitution ostensibly limits presidents to two. The vote, the first since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, was designed to both create a public mandate for the war and restore Mr. Putin’s image as the embodiment of stability. Still, Russians are somewhat edgy over what changes the vote might bring.

Here are five takeaways:

While the victory was a foregone conclusion, Putin’s numbers exceeded expectations.

There is a pattern to presidential votes involving Mr. Putin: His results get better each time. In 2012, he received 63.6 percent of the vote, and in 2018, after presidential terms were extended to six years, he got 76.7 percent. Pundits were expecting the Kremlin to peg the result at around 80 percent this time, but Mr. Putin received an even higher percentage, closer to 90 percent, although the count wasn’t yet final.

The loyal opposition parties barely registered. None of the three other candidates who were allowed on the ballot received more than five percent of the vote.

Presidential votes in Russia have long served as a means to make the entire system seem legitimate. But such a large margin of victory for Mr. Putin — who has reworked the Constitution to let him stay in the Kremlin until 2036, when he will be 83 — risks undermining that. It could raise questions in an increasingly authoritarian Kremlin about why Russia needs such a make-believe exercise.

The Kremlin did not entirely achieve the image of national unity that it sought.

Mr. Putin always seeks to project an image of political stability and control, which the carefully choreographed presidential votes are designed to burnish. But there were three events linked to opposition politics that marred that image this time around.

The first was in January, when thousands of Russians across the country lined up to sign the petitions needed to place Boris Nadezhdin, a previously low-profile politician who opposed the war in Ukraine, on the ballot. The Kremlin kept him off it.

Then Aleksei A. Navalny, Mr. Putin’s staunchest political opponent, died suddenly in an Arctic prison in February. Thousands of mourners who showed up at his funeral in Moscow chanted against Mr. Putin and the war, and even during the voting, mourners continued to place flowers on his grave.

The Navalny organization had endorsed the plan for voters to turn up in large numbers at noon, in a silent protest against Mr. Putin and the war. Mr. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who voted at the Russian Embassy in Berlin, said she had written her husband’s name on her ballot and thanked all those who had waited in long lines as part of the protest.

But it was difficult to see how the protest could translate into any kind of sustained movement, especially in the face of repressive measures that have grown steadily harsher since the Ukraine war started in February 2022. Mr. Putin’s government, for example, detained hundreds of people as they publicly mourned Mr. Navalny.

Mr. Putin will claim a popular mandate to pursue the war in Ukraine.

Mr. Putin’s campaign, and the vote itself, has been framed by the war. His December announcement that he would seek another term came in response to a question from a war veteran who appealed to him to run. The symbol of the election, a check mark in the blue, white and red of the Russian flag, resembled the V also sometimes used to show support for Russian soldiers.

Voting took place in occupied regions of Ukraine, even though Russia does not fully control the four regions that it annexed. There were elements of coercion, with poll workers sometimes bringing ballot boxes to people’s homes accompanied by an armed soldier. In the occupied regions, Mr. Putin’s margin of victory was even higher than in Russia itself.

Mr. Putin has never acknowledged that he started a war by invading Ukraine. Rather, he says he was forced to mount a “special military operation” to prevent the West from using Ukraine as a Trojan horse to undermine Russia.

He described the election turnout, reported at over 74 percent of more than 112 million registered voters, as “due to the fact that we are forced in the literal sense of the word, with weapons in our hands, to protect the interests of our citizens, our people.”

The war will continue to be an organizing principle for the Kremlin.

In his annual address to the nation in February, which served as his main campaign speech, Mr. Putin promised both guns and butter, asserting that Russia could pursue its war aims even while investing in the economy, infrastructure and longstanding goals like boosting the Russian population.

With an estimated 40 percent of public expenditure going to military spending, the economy grew by 3.6 percent in 2023, according to government statistics. Production of munitions and other matériel is booming.

Mr. Putin has also suggested that war veterans should form the core of a “new elite” to run the country, because their service proved their commitment to Russia’s best interests. That proposal is expected to accelerate a trend of public officials expressing muscular patriotism, especially as Mr. Putin seeks to replace his older allies with a younger generation.

Russians are uneasy about what happens next.

The period after any presidential election is when the Kremlin habitually introduces unpopular policies. After 2018, for example, Mr. Putin raised the retirement age. Russians are speculating about whether a new military mobilization or increased domestic repression could be around the corner.

Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied that another mobilization is needed, but recent small territorial gains in eastern Ukraine are believed to have cost tens of thousands of casualties. Although Mr. Putin has suggested that he is ready for peace talks, so far neither side has shown much flexibility.

Russia has annexed more than 18 percent of Ukrainian territory, and the battle lines have been static for months. Any new Russian offensive is expected to take place during the warm, dry summer months, and the Russian military might try to increase the amount of territory it controls before any future negotiations.

“The decisions will be more likely about war than about peace, more likely military than social or even economic,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist in exile in Berlin.

Why Are China and India Fighting Over It?,"Between a few flecks of coral in the Indian Ocean, a ribbon of highway more than a mile long swoops up from the blue. Since 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge has connected this archipelago’s hyper-dense capital, Malé, and the international airport — expanded by Chinese companies — one island to the east.

But China is not alone in chasing friendship with the Maldives. A 20-minute walk across the capital, next to Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital, an even longer sea bridge will link Malé with islands to the west. This one is being built by Indian workers, with money from India.","The Maldives, a tiny tourism-dependent country of 500,000 people, barely registers as a blip alongside India and China, the world’s most populous nations. Yet every blip counts in the two giants’ competition for influence across South Asia, and that has set the Maldives on a zigzagging course between them.

India, at the heart of the vast region, has long been its most powerful economic and military force. Still, China has made significant inroads with its much larger financial resources, signing infrastructure deals and securing access to ports in countries surrounding India.

The Maldives’ location makes it a strategic priority for both of Asia’s superpowers. China needs a military presence on the Arabian Sea to safeguard its access to oil from the Persian Gulf. And India, which has been clashing with China along their Himalayan border, wants to make sure that the Maldives, its island neighbor, doesn’t become too cozy with Beijing.

In January, India found itself in a sudden blowup with the Maldives over a perceived threat to the islands’ tourism lifeblood. But the great-power competition across the Maldives’ sky-blue lagoons has yet to reach a boil. Gains and losses are marked more by the tilts of the Maldives’ own politicians — more pro-India at some points, more pro-China at others — and, most of all, by the money that both sides spend to win Maldivian hearts and minds.

From his high-rise office looking out over Malé’s marina, Mohamed Saeed, the Maldives’ minister of economic development and trade, puts his country’s needs in stark terms. Its economy is now worth about $6.5 billion a year, of which $6 billion is earned by tourism, and most of the rest by fishing tuna. The goal is to make it a $12 billion economy within the next five years.

The Maldives discovered tourist dollars in 1972, and it now draws more than a million visitors a year to the “water villas” that branch out from wooden boardwalks and define its high-end resorts.

The country became a democracy only in 2008, with the election of a charismatic young leader, Mohamed Nasheed. The current president, Mohamed Muizzu, was elected five months ago, in the latest swing of the pendulum between India and China. Mr. Muizzu took office after campaigning on an “India Out” platform, which called for expelling about 80 Indian military personnel stationed across the Maldives to provide support.

Mr. Saeed, a Muizzu appointee, was also a cabinet minister during the last “pro-China” government, when the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge was opened. He oversaw a free-trade agreement with China. But these days he sticks to the line that Mr. Muizzu’s government is pursuing only a “pro-Maldives” policy.

There is no preference for China, he says — “we extend our invitation of free trade to all countries,” because “we would like to get the best value for our tuna.”

Pursuing cordial relations with China and India simultaneously might seem the wisest course. But that became more difficult, said Mimrah Ghafoor, a writer and former career diplomat, as both countries stepped up their influence campaigns just as the Maldives was making its transition to democracy.

China has the deeper pockets, with development banks that dwarf India’s. But, Mr. Ghafoor noted, if China “has mostly carrots,” India “has both carrots and the stick.” That is because the Maldives depends on its near neighbor in times of intense need.

Mr. Ghafoor rattled off a list of crises in which Indian help proved indispensable, from fighting back a coup launched from Sri Lanka in 1988 to rescue work after the tsunami of 2004 to a delivery of 1,200 tons of freshwater by airplane and tanker during a shortage in 2014 — a time when the Maldives was led by a China-leaning president.

Beyond money and geography, there is another important difference between India and China as competitors, one that was illustrated during the Maldives’ flare-up with India earlier this year.

Three junior ministers attacked India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on social media after he had promoted his country’s own paradisal atoll, an even smaller and far less developed archipelago called Lakshadweep. These “India Out” Maldivians inferred a threat to their economy. In the much louder backlash, nationalistic Indians urged a boycott of the islands.

The disruption to relations offered a contrast with China, which exerts supreme message control. That gives it the ability to negotiate effectively with smaller countries behind closed doors. Beijing may be less comfortable with the Maldives’ new democracy than New Delhi is, but it has navigated relations just as adeptly.

One fierce democracy advocate, Eva Abdulla, a high-ranking member of Parliament, is proudly pro-India. But mostly she is anti-oscillation.

“Flip-flopping on foreign policy is clearly not good for us,” she said. Not in terms of security, and “it doesn’t allow for any kind of stability in development projects.”

Ms. Abdulla, a cousin of Mr. Nasheed, the former president, argues that there are many reasons to stand by India as a partner. She mentions their cultural affinities, as South Asian democracies. Along with hospitals and schools on the far-flung islands, India funds things like a cultural center in Malé, to promote yoga and Indian dance.

Mr. Modi’s pro-Hindu policies at home rub many the wrong way in the Maldives, which is supposedly a 100 percent Muslim society. Even so, “we can’t afford a fistfight with India,” Ms. Abdulla said. On this, she and the president, Mr. Muizzu, whose parties will be battling each other in parliamentary elections in April, agree.

Mr. Muizzu has stepped up his calls for a generic Maldivian nationalism, in favor of the islands’ own language and its Islamic values, while steering clear of an anti-India tone. He has reluctantly made good on his promise to expel the Indian military personnel, but India has not quit its development projects.

One of the most visible is a giant expansion of an airport on the island of Hanimaadhoo, an hour’s flight north from Malé. It is home to one of the planes used by the Indian airmen. And it is the kind of project that makes some Maldivians fear that their sovereign territory is being prepared as a potential battleground in somebody else’s war.

Hanimaadhoo, population 2,664, hardly seems to need the extra runways being built by an Indian firm. Nor do the little-touristed islands nearby. Yet digging machines are at work 24 hours a day, in effect re-engineering the delicate island to make it capable of landing enormous aircraft. A similar airport, built by Indians at the opposite end of the country, makes Hanimaadhoo seem like part of a pattern.

Maldivians are not the only ones to think that. An Indian laborer at the site named Ranjit said he thought it was obvious why India needed to build a military-ready facility here. “China is coming,” he said. “Don’t you see the Chinese ships getting ready?”

On Feb. 22, the Xiang Yang Hong 03, officially a Chinese research vessel, pulled into Malé. The Maldives’ government said it was just a port call. But as with the Indian airport projects, the ship left an air of ambiguity about possible military uses in its wake."
NYTFEED020240308ek38009n9,Ex-Honduras President Found Guilty in Drug Trafficking Trial,"Juan Orlando Hernández had been accused of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and working with notorious drug traffickers like El Chapo.

For more than a decade, Juan Orlando Hernández wielded power in Honduras, first as a member of Congress, then as that body’s leader and finally as the nation’s president.","On Friday, an American jury in Federal District Court found Mr. Hernández guilty of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and of possessing and conspiring to possess “destructive devices,” including machine guns.

After the verdict was delivered, Mr. Hernández, who faces a mandatory prison term of at least 40 years and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 26, rose to his feet and stood quietly with folded hands as the jurors filed from the courtroom.

During his first presidential campaign in 2013, Mr. Hernández, a member of the right-wing Honduran National Party, portrayed himself as a law-and-order candidate who could stem the epidemic of drugs and crime that had suffused the country.

But according to prosecutors in the United States, Mr. Hernández was allied with the same forces he purported to oppose. A string of witnesses testified during a conspiracy trial in Manhattan that Mr. Hernández’s political success was fueled by drug proceeds funneled to him by cocaine traffickers whom he treated as business partners.

Prosecutors have said that Mr. Hernández received millions of dollars from trafficking organizations in Honduras, Mexico and elsewhere, including from Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, who was a Mexican drug lord and the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. In return, prosecutors added, Mr. Hernández allowed vast amounts of cocaine to pass through Honduras on its way to the United States.

He boasted that he would “stuff the drugs right up the noses of the gringos,” according to U.S. prosecutors.

Evidence and testimony presented during Mr. Hernández’s trial painted a dismal picture of a country where drugs and politics had long been intertwined and people working in politics routinely demanded and accepted bribes.

Rows of benches in the trial courtroom were filled each day with Hondurans who said they had come to watch Mr. Hernández face a judicial process of the sort some doubted could have taken place in his home country.

Some of those spectators laughed derisively when Mr. Hernández, wearing a businesslike dark suit, testified near the end of the trial, insisting that he had no connection to drug trafficking and that the witnesses who had testified to the contrary were “professional liars.”

A defense lawyer expanded upon that idea during his summation, running through a list of crimes — including a total of 224 murders — associated with several former traffickers who took the stand as government witnesses.

“This was a cast of characters you have never seen before and the likes of which you will never see again as long as you live,” the lawyer, Renato Stabile, said. “Through the trial these people have told you they were liars. They have told you they were murderers.”

But a prosecutor, Jacob H. Gutwillig, told jurors that Mr. Hernández had accepted “cocaine-fueled bribes” from cartels and “protected their drugs with the full power and strength of the state — military, police and justice system.”

Although former foreign leaders sometimes go to trial in the United States, they are not often prosecuted for drug-related offenses. The closest parallel to Mr. Hernández is Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the former leader of Panama, who in 1992 was found guilty in federal court in Miami of allowing the Medellín drug cartel to ship cocaine through his country to the United States in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes.

By the time Mr. Hernández stepped down from the presidency in 2022, he was a deeply unpopular figure in Honduras. His administration had done little to blunt the effects of crime or to create a stable economy, leading many citizens to leave the country. Mr. Hernández’s successor as president, Xiomara Castro, accused him of having turned the nation into a “narco-dictatorship,” and thousands of Hondurans celebrated when he was extradited to New York three months after leaving office.

There were celebrations outside the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, too, after the guilty verdict was announced. Dozens of people waved Honduran flags and chanted in Spanish. One woman held aloft a sign that read: “No clemency for narcopolitics.”

Photographs of people who were said to be victims of cartel violence were displayed along with an orange prison jumpsuit with handcuffs connected by a long chain.

Standing in the middle of the crowd, Carlos Hernandez, 32, said he had left Honduras while he was still a teenager to escape the violence and poverty there.

“This is historical,” he said of the verdict. “This brings the Honduran people a sense of justice they have been fighting for for a long time.”

Mr. Hernández’s trial was relatively straightforward, based mainly on testimony from witnesses, including a Honduran drug investigator and the former traffickers, including two men who said they had pleaded guilty to grave crimes and are facing potential life sentences in American prisons.

The investigator, Miguel Reynoso, testified that he was present when the Honduran authorities stopped a group of vehicles with hidden compartments and found firearms, grenades and nearly $200,000 in U.S. currency wrapped in plastic. The authorities also found notebooks with Mr. Hernández’s initials that prosecutors in Manhattan said detailed drug transactions.

Mr. Reynoso testified that the notebooks were placed into sealed plastic bags and that he brought those, seals intact, to prosecutors in the United States in 2019.

Among the former traffickers who took the stand was Amilcar Alexander Ardon Soriano, who testified that he had served as the mayor of the municipality of El Paraíso while running drugs, participated in torture and murdered two people, and that he was responsible for the deaths of more than 50 others. He said that he had asked lawmakers whom he had previously bribed to vote for Mr. Hernández as the president of the Honduran Congress. In return, Mr. Ardon said, Mr. Hernández promised to protect him from prosecutors.

Mr. Ardon added that he gave $500,000 in drug proceeds to Mr. Hernández’s presidential campaign in 2013 and had bribed people in El Paraíso to vote for him. He also said it was his understanding that El Chapo had agreed to provide that campaign with $1 million.

Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, a former leader of the brutal Honduran gang Los Cachiros, was probably the most notorious witness to take the stand. He began secretly working with American authorities a decade ago and admitted to being involved in the deaths of 78 people, including two journalists and an official who was serving as Honduras’s antidrug czar.

In 2012, Mr. Rivera testified, he had bribed Mr. Hernández with $250,000 delivered to his sister, Hilda, in exchange for protection of the Cachiros.

Asked by a defense lawyer whether he felt any remorse over the people he had harmed, Mr. Rivera replied that he was sorry for everything he did as a member of what he called “a dangerous gang,” including his payment of bribes to “corrupt” police officers and politicians.

“They should have tried to catch us,” he said, adding that instead “they allied with us.”

NYTFEED020240320ek3k006el,Georgia Judge Allows Trump and Co-Defendants to Appeal Ruling on Prosecutor,"An appeals court will now decide if it will weigh in on whether Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, should be disqualified.

In a setback for Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, a judge on Wednesday allowed defense lawyers in the Georgia criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump and his allies to try to appeal his ruling allowing Ms. Willis to stay on the case.","Defense lawyers needed permission from the judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, to pursue an appeal, and he granted it in a two-paragraph order. Whether it slows down the election interference case against Mr. Trump and his 14 co-defendants remains unclear.

The Georgia Court of Appeals must still decide if it will weigh in on whether Ms. Willis has an untenable conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship she had with a lawyer she hired to run the Trump case, and on other related matters.

Judge McAfee wrote in his brief order that he “intends to continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions” while the higher court decides what to do.

If the appeals court declines to take up the question, the matter will be resolved quickly. If it decides an appeal is warranted, the matter could take months to clear up.

In a statement, Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for Ms. Willis’s office, said that prosecutors would continue to work on the case.

“As the case is not stayed during the appeal, this office will work to move it forward to trial as quickly as possible,” Mr. DiSantis said. “We will limit our comment on the appellate matter to what we file with the Court of Appeals during the briefing process.”

Steven H. Sadow, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer in Georgia, called the order “highly significant” in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the defense was “optimistic that appellate review will lead to the case being dismissed and the D.A. being disqualified.”

No trial date has been set in the broader case; the district attorney’s office had sought to begin a trial in early August, about a year after Ms. Willis brought charges, but few expect that to happen now.

The case charges Mr. Trump and a number of his allies with conspiring to circumvent the will of Georgia voters in 2020. But the details of the case have been overshadowed this year by hearings delving into a romantic relationship that Ms. Willis had with Nathan J. Wade, the lawyer she hired to run the Trump case.

Last week, Judge McAfee ruled that Ms. Willis and her office could continue leading the prosecution so long as Mr. Wade stepped away from it. Defense lawyers, who brought the relationship to light in court filings, had sought to disqualify Ms. Willis, saying she had an untenable conflict of interest.

Judge McAfee disagreed, but rebuked Ms. Willis in his ruling for a “tremendous lapse in judgment.” He also found an “appearance of impropriety,” which he said required Mr. Wade to withdraw in order for Ms. Willis to keep the case.

Mr. Wade resigned from his post as a special prosecutor hours after the ruling on Friday.

Under Georgia law, the defense lawyers now have 10 days to file an application to the appeals court arguing why an appeal is necessary. The district attorney’s office will have 10 days from the filing of that application to respond.

The appeals court will have 45 days from the defense filing to say whether it is going to take the case or not."

NYTFEED020240315ek3f003mp,Senegal’s Leading Opposition Politicians Freed From Jail Just Before Election,"The presidential candidate of the main opposition party, as well as its powerful founder, was released 10 days before the West African country is set to hold a national election.

Two opposition party politicians were released from jail in Senegal on Thursday night, just 10 days before a nationwide election in which one of them is running for president.","Hundreds of supporters celebrated in the streets of Dakar after Ousmane Sonko, Senegal’s foremost opposition leader, was freed along with Bassirou Diomaye Faye, his party’s candidate in the election on March 24.

“You never gave up even when we were absent. You kept on fighting.” Mr. Faye told supporters in Dakar on Thursday evening. “Today we are ready to join you in the same fight.”

The release is the latest in a series of unexpected moves by the incumbent president, Macky Sall, who cited allegations of corruption when he announced last month that he was canceling the election. Facing a backlash, he reversed course and set the election for Sunday, March 24 — just nine days before his term ends.

After years of hinting that he might run again, Mr. Sall finally confirmed last July that he would step down after his two terms were up.

Senegal, a coastal West African nation of 17 million people, is seen as a bastion of democracy relative to some of its West African neighbors, which are ruled by military juntas following a spate of coups in recent years.

Mr. Sonko was ineligible to run in the upcoming election because he was convicted last June of corrupting a minor and sentenced to two years in prison. Mr. Faye was running from jail, where he was awaiting trial on defamation charges and contempt of court, after he accused magistrates of persecuting Mr. Sonko to serve Mr. Sall’s interests in a social media post last year.

Campaigning has started for the election. Mr. Sall’s chosen successor, the former prime minister Amadou Ba, has held rallies that have been poorly attended and have garnered little attention.

Alioune Tine, an expert on human rights in West Africa, said that the imprisonment of Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye had increased their cachet, especially for Mr. Faye, who was a little-known figure before he was named Mr. Sonko’s replacement for the election.

“When you throw leaders in jail, you turn them into heroes,” said Mr. Tine, the founder of the AfrikaJom Center, a research organization in Dakar.

As Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye paraded in Dakar’s downtown on Thursday evening, it was Mr. Sonko’s name that supporters chanted. But Mr. Sonko kept a low profile while Mr. Faye addressed the crowds with a microphone, standing in a car, a scarf in the colors of the Senegalese flag around his neck.

“Sonko will play a central role in the campaign, but the key challenge for him will be not to overshadow Faye too much, so Faye can win,” Mr. Tine added.

Mr. Sonko seemed intent on staying in the background on Friday. Briefing reporters, Mr. Sonko said that the government had spoken to him about postponing the election again so that he could run. But, Mr. Sonko said, he was happy for Mr. Faye to be the candidate.

“It’s not about me, it’s about the party,” he said. “Diomaye Faye has never made a decision without asking me.”

Nineteen candidates in all are on the ballot for the election in Senegal, one of the few countries in the region that has never endured military rule. In recent years, however, Mr. Sall’s government repeatedly cut off access to the internet and forbade demonstrations as Mr. Sonko rose to fame.

Dozens of protesters have been killed during anti-government riots, many by live ammunition that human rights groups said was fired by the country’s security forces.

Mr. Sonko is a charismatic yet divisive figure who was tried on charges of raping an employee of a massage parlor. He was acquitted of rape but sentenced last year to two years in prison for “corruption of youth” because the employee was under 21.

Mr. Sall signed an amnesty law earlier this month that eventually led to the release of Mr. Faye and Mr. Sonko. But Mr. Sonko’s role in both the upcoming election and the country’s political future remains unclear.

A former tax inspector and currently the mayor of the southern town of Ziguinchor, Mr. Sonko has vowed to rid Senegal of corruption, appealing to young Senegalese voters — though he has not made clear how he plans to execute his promises of sweeping change.

“Sonko is the person Senegal needs,” said Serge Goudiaby Atepa, a well-known Senegalese architect and the head of Senegal’s main lobby of business leaders.

Mr. Atepa also praised Mr. Sall for releasing Mr. Sonko, who for years was his main political foe. “The crowds we saw on the streets last night prove that it was the right thing to do,” he said."
NYTFEED020240307ek370099d,State Investigations Create More Peril for Trump Prosecutor in Georgia,"A claim made about the prosecutor, Fani Willis, at a State Senate hearing proved false, but it hinted at the turbulence she might face even if an effort to disqualify her fails.

A new investigation unfolding at the Georgia State Capitol is previewing the turbulence that Fani T. Willis, the district attorney prosecuting Donald J. Trump, may face even if a judge allows her to keep the high-stakes case.","At a hearing on Wednesday before a special committee of the State Senate, which recently began investigating Ms. Willis, the defense lawyer leading the disqualification effort testified that Ms. Willis had once taken a large sum of money from her political campaign for her personal use.

The senator presiding over the hearing, Bill Cowsert, a Republican, was taken aback by the allegation. “I think all of us up here that have campaigns know that you can’t take campaign funds for personal use, right?” he asked.

The defense lawyer, Ashleigh Merchant, told Mr. Cowsert that she was “not well versed in that area of law, but that is my understanding.” He replied, “It’s pretty black and white.”

There is no evidence to back up the allegation. In fact, Ms. Willis lent her first campaign nearly $50,000, drawn from a retirement account, and was paid back only a fraction of that, according to her office, campaign finance records and her past remarks.

But the incident reflected that even if Ms. Willis survives the effort to disqualify her, she would face tough inquiries by Georgia Republicans that could perpetuate questions about her character and uncertainty around the Trump case for months to come.

Seven months have passed since Ms. Willis brought the racketeering case against Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies, charging them with conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Four of the defendants have already pleaded guilty, and Ms. Willis at one point told the judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, that she was aiming for a trial to start in August.

But the case was upended in January after Ms. Merchant revealed in a court filing that Ms. Willis had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the lawyer she hired in November 2021 to manage the Trump case.

Ms. Merchant represents Michael Roman, a defendant and former Trump campaign official. She and other defense lawyers have said that Ms. Willis engaged in “self-dealing,” because she took a number of vacations with Mr. Wade after hiring him while using public funds to pay him more than $650,000 to date.

The filing forced Ms. Willis to publicly acknowledge that she and Mr. Wade had pursued a romance. And the allegations were concerning enough that Judge McAfee held a series of public hearings over the last few weeks to determine whether the relationship had created a disqualifying conflict of interest. The judge has said that he will decide by next week.

Legal experts have pointed out that Ms. Willis could have avoided this particular controversy had she not had a romantic relationship with someone who worked for her.

Ms. Merchant testified on Wednesday that if Ms. Willis had gone to the county and said, “I’m having an affair with this man, but he is brilliant and he would be an amazing prosecutor on this election interference case,” then “we wouldn’t be here,” because the hiring, Ms. Merchant later added, “wouldn’t have been approved.”

The Senate investigation is one of several springing up around Ms. Willis. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a Trump ally and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has used the conflict-of-interest allegations to seek more records as part of the committee’s ongoing investigation of the district attorney’s office. Georgia Republicans are in the process of empowering a prosecutorial oversight commission that is also expected to review the matter.

The Republican-controlled Senate created its special committee to investigate Ms. Willis soon after the motion was filed to disqualify her. The committee has no power to punish the district attorney. But with the power to issue subpoenas, it can embarrass her.

That could help Mr. Trump as he seeks to win Georgia in the presidential election. Negative headlines about Ms. Willis generated by the committee’s work could also influence potential jurors if the Trump case ends up going to trial.

During the Senate hearing on Wednesday, Ms. Merchant said that Ms. Willis recently testified that she had used a large amount of money from her failed 2018 campaign for a local judgeship to reimburse Mr. Wade for expenses from their vacations.

Ms. Merchant said that Ms. Willis testified “that the majority of the cash she had on hand was from her campaign,” and that it was “a loan she had given herself from the campaign.”

“She was very clear about that,” Ms. Merchant added.

In fact, Ms. Willis’s testimony on Feb. 15 was not clear. She said: “When I ran for judge I took $50,000 of my personal money out of my retirement and that money ended up being lost.”

Later in her testimony, when she was pressed further about how she had repaid Mr. Wade, she said that she had taken “a large amount of money on my first campaign,” and that she had “kept some of the cash of that.” Neither the judge nor defense lawyers asked at the time what exactly she meant.

Campaign finance records from Ms. Willis’s judicial campaign show loans of $49,000, and that the campaign reimbursed her roughly $8,500 in 2018.

After the Senate hearing, a spokesman for Ms. Willis’s office said Ms. Merchant had “misstated the D.A.’s testimony.” The spokesman, Jeff DiSantis, said Ms. Willis “testified that she took money out of her retirement to fund her unsuccessful 2018 campaign for Superior Court judge.”

“She did not testify that she took money out of her campaign for herself, other than the repayment of the loan that is detailed in her campaign report,” he added.

Ms. Merchant, in an email, said that her testimony “was based on Ms. Willis’s statements under oath.”

The Senate committee is planning to meet again in the next few weeks."

President Macky Sall of Senegal on Wednesday dissolved his cabinet, replaced the prime minister and rescheduled the country’s presidential election to March 24, according to a government statement. The move came weeks after Mr. Sall postponed the ballot indefinitely, throwing the country into one of its deepest political crises in recent history as many feared he might try to stay in power past his term limit.","The election, which is likely to be one of the most closely watched in Africa this year, was initially set for Feb. 25, but Mr. Sall unexpectedly put it off, with no announcement of a new date. He cited an inquiry into allegations of corruption at the Constitutional Court, but political opponents and some analysts called the maneuver a constitutional coup. His decision Wednesday to set a date may allay some of the fears that he was trying to remain in office.

The political deadlock prompted alarm among Senegal’s international allies, including the United States and European countries, which have long considered the coastal West African nation of 17 million people a reliable diplomatic partner. It is also a favored recipient of aid in a part of Africa that has been convulsed by coups and where aging leaders have kept their hold on power despite constitutional limits.

The Constitutional Court, Senegal’s highest tribunal, promptly overturned Mr. Sall’s attempt to delay the election last month. Shortly after the court’s decision, the president said he would leave power on April 2, when his term will expire.

But who will lead the country between the April deadline and the swearing in of a new president remains unclear. Senegal may require a runoff election after results come in for the voting on March 24, but the government did not set a date for a runoff, nor did it specify who would govern the country in the interim.

Mr. Sall also dismissed his prime minister, Amadou Ba, according to the statement. Mr. Ba is the presidential candidate of Mr. Sall’s party, and the dismissal on Wednesday added confusion as to whether Mr. Sall still supported him.

Sidiki Kaba, the interior minister, will serve as prime minister, according to Yoro Dia, Mr. Sall’s spokesman. With the cabinet dissolved, Mr. Kaba will form one of his own.

Mr. Sall has been in office for two terms and is barred by Senegal’s Constitution from seeking a third. The country has faced years of political upheaval and uncertainty. Over the past three years, during Mr. Sall’s second term, the government jailed hundreds of protesters and political opponents, repeatedly forbade protests and cut off the internet.

Over the past few weeks, however, Mr. Sall’s government has softened its stance against the opposition and civil-society groups, allowing demonstrations again and adopting an amnesty law that benefits political prisoners. It has also reopened Cheikh Anta Diop university, one of West Africa’s most prestigious and a hot spot for demonstrations. The university was closed last June after antigovernment riots erupted in the capital, Dakar.

Mr. Sall has also said that he is ready to pardon Ousmane Sonko, his biggest political opponent, who is in jail and barred from running in the coming election.

Some analysts said that, despite signs over the past two years that Mr. Sall might try to cling to power, he had backtracked to preserve his, and Senegal’s, global image.

“Macky Sall had for a while been the spoiled child of the international community — from France to the United States, but also Russia and Arab countries,” said Alioune Tine, a well-known Senegalese human rights defender who has played an informal mediating role between the president and the opposition in recent weeks.

“That capital was at risk of collapsing when he postponed the election,” Mr. Tine said, but he added that Mr. Sall “now wants to exit in an honorable way.”

Nineteen candidates are scheduled to compete in the presidential balloting now set for March 24, including Mr. Ba, the now former prime minister, and Bassirou Diomaye Faye, the candidate for the leading opposition party. Whether Mr. Sonko could participate in the election if Mr. Sall were to pardon him is unclear. Mr. Faye is his replacement.

Despite Mr. Sall’s recent softening toward the opposition, critics argue that during his 12 years in power, he significantly weakened Senegal’s democracy. Dozens of protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces, and Mr. Sall is set to leave the presidency amid deep unpopularity.

Mr. Sall’s defenders have argued that he never crossed the line into authoritarianism and that Senegal’s young democracy has experienced the kinds of challenges many other such democracies often face.

But his opponents have not been mollified. Sixteen of the 19 candidates taking part in the election refused to participate in a dialogue organized by Mr. Sall last week to find a solution to the ongoing political crisis."
NYTFEED020240322ek3m0058x,Biden’s Big Bet on Chips Helps Jobs in the U.S. (and Costa Rica),"President Biden’s announcement on Wednesday of $20 billion in grants and loans to Intel, the computer chip maker, understandably focused on the tens of thousands of American jobs he said would be created in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio.

But it would be more accurate to talk about the North American jobs that will be created. Other countries in this hemisphere also stand to gain from the bid to bring the manufacturing of computer chips — the oil of the 21st century — closer to home.","For years, computer chip companies around the world have relied on factories in China and Taiwan to assemble and test the tiny electronic brains that run smartphones and supercomputers. As competition with China heats up, this dependency is causing alarm, a feeling that helped push the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act across the finish line in 2022.

The big subsidies pushed by Biden are aimed at restoring American leadership in this critical technology. But it’s not practical to manufacture everything here, given how cheap production has gotten in Asia. Moving production closer and to U.S. allies might be the best we can do. That’s why Biden’s announcement is being celebrated in Costa Rica, the Central American country that is home to the only factory in this hemisphere outside the United States where Intel can assemble and test computer chips.

Intel built it in the 1990s — an investment that transformed the Costa Rican economy by enabling an advanced manufacturing boom. Today, Costa Rica’s biggest export is medical devices, not bananas.

In 2014, Intel sent much of the work it was doing in Costa Rica to Asia, where testing and packaging were cheaper. But Intel kept a skeleton crew in Costa Rica to do research and development. In 2020 the pandemic caused a chip shortage so acute that Intel has fired up its Costa Rican factory again.

I toured that factory recently and can report that it is expanding so fast that a cafeteria has been turned into a new part of the factory floor. If Americans want to quickly reduce their dependency on Asia for computer chips, this place is crucial.

Its importance is underscored by a visit on Thursday by the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo. It shows the administration understands reality: Semiconductor supply chains are global, and the United States can’t go it alone."
NYTFEED020240312ek3c00231,‘Jamming’: How Electronic Warfare Is Reshaping Ukraine’s Battlefields,"Drones have become a critical weapon for both sides, but a lack of coordination among troops has put Ukraine at a disadvantage.

The Ukrainian soldier swore and tore off his headset. His video monitor had gone blurry at first, the landscape of shattered trees and shell craters barely visible, before blacking out completely. The Russians had jammed the signal of his drone as it was flying outside the town of Kreminna in eastern Ukraine.","“Some days everything goes smoothly, other days the equipment breaks, the drones are fragile and there is jamming,” said the soldier, who goes by the call sign DJ and was speaking from his underground outpost a few miles from the front line.

For a while, the Ukrainians enjoyed a honeymoon period with their self-detonating drones that were used like homemade missiles. The weapons seemed like an effective alternative to artillery shells for striking Russian forces.

Now, the bad days are starting to outweigh the good ones: electronic countermeasures have become one of the Russian military’s most formidable weapons after years of honing their capabilities.

Electronic warfare remains a hidden hand in much of the war, and like Ukraine’s disadvantage in troop numbers and ammunition supplies, Ukraine suffers in this area as well in comparison to Russia. Russia has more jamming equipment capable of overpowering Ukrainian signals by broadcasting on the same frequencies at higher power. It also exhibits better coordination among their units.

With western military aid looking far from certain and artillery ammunition running low, the pressure on Ukraine’s unmanned air capacity has only grown, leaving Kyiv’s forces in an increasingly perilous position.

Interviews with Ukrainian soldiers, commanders and military analysts say that Russia’s jamming capabilities are straining Ukraine’s limited supplies of off-the-shelf drones and threatening to sideline a key component of Ukraine’s arsenal as the Kremlin mass produces its own fleet of drones.

Ukrainian troops describe a back and forth dance where one side makes technological changes — such as using different frequencies or jamming devices for drones — then the other side catches up in a matter of weeks or months, undercutting any short-lived advantage.

“There is a constant arms race,” said Babay, a sergeant in charge of a drone platoon on Ukraine’s eastern front, who, like DJ and others interviewed for this article, went by his call sign, as is military protocol. “We are improving our technology to counter these new realities on the battlefield, and in a while, the Russians will again have to invent something new to be able to defend themselves against our attacks.”

Small, cheap drones have been a staple of the conflict in Ukraine since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists attacked in the country’s east. But in 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the use of the unmanned vehicles over the battlefield ballooned.

In 2023, Ukraine gained the upper hand in the drone war by deploying the compact racing drones known as FPVs, for First Person Views, in large quantities.

“FPVs play a critical role for us, as these toys are essentially mobile artillery that compensate for the lack of artillery ammunition,” said Dyadya, a drone operator with the 63rd Mechanized Brigade. “We work at the same distance as a mortar, but our accuracy is much higher.”

Artillery’s strength often comes from its imprecision. By blanketing wide areas with high explosives and fragmentation, it can quickly disrupt battlefield operations by maiming troops and destroying vehicles. It’s a tactic that is near impossible to replicate with one or two drones.

As Ukraine’s artillery ammunition dwindled last fall and into the winter, the FPVs, used as guided projectiles, were effective in suppressing and harassing Russian trenches and vehicles. Precious artillery ammo was reserved to push back Russian ground attacks.

But the Russian military has since improved its jamming capabilities and also uses poor weather to its advantage, advancing in fog and rain when drones have difficulty flying.

“Both sides have quickly picked up on their adversary’s key FPV developments and tactics,” said Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russian military drones at the Center for Naval Analyses, a research organization based in Virginia. “And now these technologies are maturing very rapidly for both sides.”

Earlier this month, DJ’s small team, part of a national guard unit known as the Bureviy Brigade, set up their drone outpost among the ruins of a farmhouse near the frontline outside of Kreminna. They deployed the essentials needed to broadcast video and relay commands from the pilot to the cheap Chinese made FPV quadcopter: antennas, frequency relays, Starlink satellite internet and a laptop computer.

On the first two missions, DJ’s monitor showed the Ukrainian steppe below as his drone catapulted through the wilderness at upward of 60 miles per hour, strapped with roughly three pounds of high explosives and aimed at destroying Russian vehicles. But soon, the signal was lost, jammed by the Russians.

The third mission, targeting a grenade launcher in a Russian trench line, was partially successful: The $500 dollar drone detonated in a tree above the trench, but it had been jammed just a dozen or so yards away before it exploded.

Though potent, the Russian military’s jamming capabilities are deployed unevenly across the more than 600 miles of frontline, and their armored vehicles are often easy targets because they usually don’t have jamming systems installed, Ukrainian soldiers said.

Ukraine’s approach to drones and electronic warfare has been funded and supplied in part by disparate groups outside of the military, including the country’s well-known IT sector. Each drone unit on the battlefield serves as a sort of test lab for new technologies, procurement and combat missions.

Russia’s approach has been far more top down, with heavy military oversight. This has made the country’s drone fleet more predictable, with less variation in tactics and type. But it has also allowed the Russian military to jam Ukrainian drones on the battlefield without having to jam their own, by coordinating between flight paths and the jammers.

“There is nothing like that on the Ukrainian side,” said one drone operator flying for Ukraine.

The lack of a broader command structure capable of coordinating drone units across the frontline often translates to confusion among Ukrainian troops. Drone operators can sometimes lose connection with their craft and end up looking through the camera of another drone.

FPV drones fly on an analog frequency, and since many are store bought, they come out of the box set to the same frequency. Ukrainian drone units often need soldiers who are skilled in coding to change the frequency on a drone’s software.

Dev, a Ukrainian drone technician, rated this issue second in significance to Russian jamming capabilities.

“There are many FPV groups operating at the front. The front is saturated with FPV groups, and there are no more frequency channels,” he said.

Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a new part of the armed forces that, among other things, should improve the interaction of FPV units with one another.

But Russia’s ability to mass produce its drones on an industrial scale is also a pressing problem. Ukrainian troops said they are often forced to scrounge for their drones, despite pledges from the government to produce thousands of them.

Chef, a drone company commander in Ukraine’s east, said his unit flies about 20-30 FPV missions a day, depending on their supply of the drones, which comes almost entirely from volunteer donations. The government has barely supplied his unit, he said. Last July, they received a handful of them, and then again in December.

“We launch as many as we produce,” he said. But “you can’t just use FPVs to win this war.”

NYTFEED020240325ek3p003s5,Ukrainians Dismiss Kremlin Suggestions Their Country Was Behind Moscow Attack,"Officials and ordinary citizens say Russia is blaming Ukraine in order to shore up support for its war in Ukraine and escalate the fighting there.

Ukrainians have reacted with a mixture of concern and mockery to the narrative pushed by the Kremlin and Russian state media that Ukraine was behind the terrorist attack Friday on a Moscow concert hall, a claim made despite the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility.","For some Ukrainians — officials and citizens alike — the accusations were typical of a Kremlin playbook, blaming Ukraine to justify Moscow’s violence against their country. That includes the false claim that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia used to begin the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, stating that the country was run by neo-Nazi leaders and that the aim of the war was to denazify the country.

“It’s typical for Russia,” Iryna Blakyta, 24, a resident of Kyiv, said on Monday, adding that she expected Mr. Putin to use the attack on the concert hall to rally Russians after more than two years of war. “He needs to mobilize people,” Ms. Blakyta said; “he needs to show who the enemy is.”

But worries about Mr. Putin’s next steps intensified on Monday morning in Kyiv, which was targeted by two ballistic missiles in broad daylight, the third air assault against the Ukrainian capital in five days. A university building in a central part of the city was reduced to rubble, and officials said at least 10 people had been injured.

The United States has confirmed the claim of responsibility by ISIS. And, on Monday night, Mr. Putin acknowledged that “radical Islamists” had executed the attack, but he also said Ukraine, backed by the West, could have masterminded the assault. Ukraine denied any involvement.

Ukrainian officials said Mr. Putin’s hints that Ukraine was involved were in line with the Kremlin’s longstanding practice of sowing disinformation to cover up the failings of its security services.

“Putin is a pathological liar,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, wrote on X on Sunday, listing a series of bombings, murders and aggressive actions by Russia that he said were all cloaked in lies, including Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and the downing of an airliner over Ukraine by Kremlin-backed fighters the same year.

“Do not let Putin and his henchmen dupe you,” Mr. Kuleba said.

Mr. Putin had earlier claimed in a statement about Friday’s attack, which killed at least 139 people, that the suspects “were heading toward Ukraine” after rampaging through the concert hall and that “according to preliminary information, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border.” He stuck to this claim on Monday.

But Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, ridiculed that claim over the weekend, saying that the Ukrainian-Russian border is an active combat zone that is heavily mined and guarded by both sides — making any crossing extremely complicated and dangerous.

“You don’t need to be a security expert” to understand this, Mr. Yusov said on Ukrainian television on Saturday.

He and other officials have pointed to Russia’s use of previous terror attacks to pursue political goals, including Mr. Putin using a deadly school siege in 2004 to consolidate political control over the country’s regions, abolishing direct governor elections until their restoration in 2012.

Some Ukrainian officials and analysts have said that Russia’s attempts to shift the blame to Ukraine could be used to lay the groundwork for expanding conscription. Russia has captured several cities and villages in Ukraine in recent months, but at considerable human cost, making it crucial to replenish its forces.

“Their only goal is to motivate more Russians to die in their senseless and criminal war against Ukraine,” Mr. Kuleba said.

Mykola Davidiuk, a Ukrainian political analyst, said Mr. Putin wanted to portray Ukraine as “a cruel enemy” linked to terrorism in order to stir up “aggressive attitudes toward Ukraine among Russian people.”

But he added that Ukrainians “don’t care” about this narrative because they have long been used to the Kremlin’s spurious portrayal of the conflict.

For now, people in Ukraine were left wondering whether Mr. Putin would use the terrorist attack to justify more deadly strikes against Ukraine. “He needs to constantly create some reasons, to keep things in control,” Ms. Blakyta said.

On Monday at around 10:30 a.m., residents of Kyiv were startled by a series of loud bangs that came less than a minute after air raid alerts blared across the capital, prompting people to run in the streets to get to shelter.

The Ukrainian Air Force said it had intercepted two ballistic missiles launched from Crimea, but falling debris destroyed a university gym. “Fortunately, there was nobody inside because it was closed,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko of Kyiv said as he visited the site of the strike.

Nearby, investigators were busy collecting and marking missile debris to analyze and determine exactly what kind of weapon was used. Because the missiles streaked into Kyiv quickly after the alarm sounded, there has been speculation that Russia used one of its powerful hypersonic missiles, which fly at several times the speed of sound.

All that remained of the university building that was hit was a huge pile of bricks, twisted metal structures and broken concrete slabs. Cars nearby were covered in a thick layer of dust, and local people watched as rescuers and firefighters cleared away the rubble, still in shock at what had happened.

“A column of smoke and dust rose, just like in a fog. Then, sirens, rescue vehicles, emergency services,” said Evelina Korzhova, 30, standing in her flower shop, which faced the destroyed building. The shop’s glass window had been shattered by the blast.

In his evening address on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that over the past week Russia had launched some 190 missiles, 140 attack drones and 700 aerial bombs at Ukraine.

Según los bomberos y los residentes, la falta de agua en los hidrantes agravó las cosas.

A medida que un incendio forestal arrasó con rapidez las ciudades de Viña del Mar y Quilpué en la costa del Pacífico de Chile el mes pasado, las llamas rodearon a los residentes en la calle, destruyeron casas y sobrepasaron la red de servicios públicos. Se cortó la electricidad, se interrumpieron las comunicaciones y no llegó el agua necesaria para una línea de defensa crítica: los hidrantes.","En este reportaje en video, varios bomberos y residentes de Quilpué y Viña del Mar dijeron a los reporteros de The New York Times que la escasez de agua obstaculizó los esfuerzos para salvar casas y detener el avance del fuego, lo que los obligó a tener que salir de algunos sectores de ambas ciudades.

El incendio forestal —el más mortífero de la historia de Chile, con 134 muertos y miles de casas destruidas— ardió fuera de control casi desde el principio, impulsado por unas condiciones climáticas extremas, fuertes vientos y árboles inflamables.

Según los bomberos y los residentes, la falta de agua empeoró las cosas.

Chile, un país inmerso en una prolongada sequía, se enfrenta a continuos problemas de abastecimiento de agua para combatir los incendios forestales en zonas urbanas.

En la región de Valparaíso, que incluye Viña del Mar y Quilpué, los expertos en incendios forestales afirman que el desarrollo desordenado ha hecho que las ciudades y pueblos sean especialmente vulnerables a los incendios forestales.

“Es un problema de oferta y demanda”, dijo Miguel Castillo, profesor del Laboratorio de Incendios Forestales de la Universidad de Chile, quien trabaja con las ciudades en medidas de prevención de incendios forestales.

“Esta agua muchas veces no está disponible para el combate”, dijo y agregó que el problema había persistido durante años en la región. “Ese problema ahora aumentó”.

Esval, la empresa privada que suministra agua a la región de Valparaíso, negó que hubieran problemas con los hidrantes en la zona del incendio y afirmó que el sistema local de agua trabajó a plena capacidad.

Mientras el fuego hacía estragos, Esval dijo que había reducido el suministro de agua fuera de la zona del incendio para reforzar la presión del sistema.

Daniel Garín, un funcionario con experiencia, quien ha trabajado durante 13 años en el cuerpo de bomberos de Quilpué, le dijo al Times que los problemas de presión del agua y los hidrantes fuera de servicio ya existían antes del incendio de febrero.

A principios de enero, después de que un supermercado se incendiara en Viña del Mar, el jefe de bomberos de la ciudad, Patricio Brito, declaró a una estación de televisión local que no había agua en los hidrantes, diciendo: “La verdad es que el agua en este sector es nulo, nulo”.

Un diputado local, Andrés Celis Montt, dijo que era necesario investigar y solucionar el “grave problema” con los hidrantes antes de la temporada alta de incendios forestales, que en Chile suele durar hasta abril.

El 2 de febrero, en el barrio El Olivar de Viña del Mar, Yanet Alarcón dijo que vio con impotencia cómo el fuego se acercaba y la manguera de agua que estaba usando para rociar su casa de dos pisos se secó. Tuvo que huir, y su casa fue consumida por el fuego.

“Cuando yo pasé todavía había una llama aquí. Había llamas adentro, de hecho focos de llamas dentro”, dijo Alarcón entre lágrimas.

En Quilpué, Mauricio Miranda dijo que los bomberos no habían podido encontrar agua en los hidrantes cercanos y se quedaron detenidos esperando a que llegaran suministros mientras su casa ardía.

“Cuando llegamos después del incendio, la casa estaba consumida y no había nada de agua dentro. Eso significaba que los bomberos no tiraron agua”, dijo.

Miranda y una decena de familias del barrio de Canal Chacao dijeron que tenían previsto reunirse con Esval para solicitar una indemnización, alegando que el hecho de que la empresa no suministrara suficiente agua a los hidrantes provocó la destrucción de sus hogares.

APRS000020250819el8j007pt, Shubman Gill named vice-captain as India announces Asia Cup squad ,"MUMBAI, India (AP) — Shubman Gill has been named vice-captain as India’s Asia Cup squad was announced on Tuesday.

Gill, who is India’s test captain, scored 754 runs across five tests in England where a thrilling series ended in a 2-2 tie.","He had last played a T20 against Sri Lanka in July 2024, when coach Gautam Gambhir took up the job. Since then, India has experimented in the T20 arena with Suryakumar Yadav as skipper.

Gill, who leads Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League, scored 650 runs in the 2025 season and couldn’t be ignored further after his success in England.

“He was the vice-captain when we last played in Sri Lanka and the new T20 cycle had begun. However, we got busy with test cricket and he didn’t get opportunities (in T20s). We are happy to have him back,” said Yadav, who has been retained as skipper.

India and Pakistan resume cricket ties

The 2025 Asia Cup will be played in the United Arab Emirates from Sept. 9. Dubai and Abu Dhabi will host the 19 matches, with the Dubai International Stadium hosting the final on Sept. 28.

The tournament will also mark a resumption of cricket ties between India and Pakistan – after escalating military tensions earlier this year with both the IPL and the Pakistan Super League halted briefly.

India and Pakistan will first meet in Group A on Sept. 14, with another game slated for the next round – Super Four – potentially on Sept. 21. Both matches will be played in Dubai. There could be a third possible clash in the final, if both sides make it that far in the tournament.

Bumrah back, Iyer and Jaiswal miss out

Pacer Jasprit Bumrah returns to the T20 squad for the first time since the 2024 World Cup. He played only three tests on the English tour because of fitness and workload management.

Shreyas Iyer, who led Punjab Kings to the 2025 IPL final and scored 604 runs in 17 games, is one of the two big names to miss out. Iyer had played a stellar role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy win in March.

Yashasvi Jaiswal also missed out – the left-handed opener had scored 411 runs in five tests against England and 559 runs for Rajasthan Royals in the 2025 IPL. However, there was no place for a fourth opening option in the Indian squad after Gill’s inclusion.

“It is unfortunate (to leave Jaiswal out). With what Abhishek Sharma has done over the last year or so with the bat, and he gives us a bowling option as well, one of these guys was always going to miss out,"" chief selector Ajit Agarkar said. ""It’s the same with Iyer – no fault of his, but who will he replace?”

Tilak Varma, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Rinku Singh will form the middle order for India, leaving Iyer out. Jitesh Sharma is included as the second keeper-batter option after Sanju Samson, but it isn’t clear who will open the innings for India given Gill’s inclusion.

“The captain and the coach will take a call on the best balance for the team,"" Agarkar said. ""Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity on the conditions. There are more options available to us – Shubman is in great form, as is Sanju. So we have two good options along with Abhishek.”

Spinners Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy, along with pacers Bumrah, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh complete the bowling core for India.

Neutral venue

The 2025 Asia Cup is officially hosted by India. Under an Asian Cricket Council decision, the tournament is held in a neutral venue whenever India or Pakistan is the host.

The 2023 Asia Cup (played in ODI format) was split between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with the latter hosting all Indian games along with the final.

India squad: Suryakumar Yadav (captain), Shubman Gill (vice-captain), Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah.

NYTFEED020240216ek2g003ju,Takeaways From Day 2 of the Hearing in the Georgia Trump Case,"In questioning a key witness, defense lawyers failed to undercut assertions by the prosecutors whom they are trying to get disqualified from the election interference case.

Defense lawyers for Donald J. Trump and his co-defendants in Georgia found themselves frustrated in efforts to extract damaging information from a key witness on Friday, as they sought to disqualify the lead prosecutors accusing Mr. Trump and his allies of a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.","The defense is arguing that Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, and her office should be disqualified and removed from the prosecution, accusing her of benefiting financially from a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired for the case, Nathan J. Wade.

If the judge removes them, it would delay and potentially derail a proceeding that has major implications for the 2024 presidential election. Here are takeaways from the second day of the misconduct hearing:

The ‘star witness’ for the defense shed no new light on the relationship.

Defense lawyers had high hopes for drawing out damaging testimony from Terrence Bradley, a former law partner of Mr. Wade who also served as his divorce lawyer.

But they were frustrated twice: Mr. Bradley didn’t show up to testify in the morning. Then, once he took the stand in the afternoon, he continued to assert attorney-client privilege over many matters.

That led to repeated sparring between defense lawyers and the district attorney’s office over what questions he could be asked, and — at points — exasperation from a calm but clearly frustrated presiding judge, Scott McAfee.

A defense lawyer used her own cellphone messages to question the key witness.

Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for one of Mr. Trump’s co-defendants, took the unusual tactic of referring to text messages from her own cellphone that she had exchanged with Mr. Bradley after learning that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade were dating.

Ms. Merchant was hoping to establish that the relationship started before Mr. Wade was hired to manage the Trump prosecution for Ms. Willis, which defense lawyers have asserted would benefit her financially if they were dating and taking expensive trips together.

But after more than two hours of questioning, Ms. Merchant and her fellow defense lawyers were unable to draw anything out of Mr. Bradley establishing that Mr. Wade was dating Ms. Willis when she hired him.

Judge McAfee did say, however, that he would review two text messages from Mr. Bradley to determine whether they are subject to attorney-client privilege, and thus cannot be disclosed.

The district attorney did not retake the stand as expected — but her father did.

After her heated exchanges with the defense attorneys while testifying on Thursday, Ms. Willis was expected to return to the stand on Friday. But in a surprise move, her office said they did not have additional questions for her.

Instead, Ms. Willis’s father, John Floyd III, testified about the death threats his daughter has faced in recent years, including when people showed up outside her house at 5:30 a.m. one morning yelling the “the b-word” and “the n-word.”

Mr. Floyd also backed up Ms. Willis’s testimony that she keeps money in her house, describing it as “a Black thing.” Ms. Willis said Thursday that she had paid back Mr. Wade in cash for the trips they took together.

“I’ve always told my daughter, you keep six months worth of cash, always,” Mr. Floyd said, adding that he gave his daughter her first cash box.

A former governor also testified.

The district attorney’s office called former Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia, who testified that Ms. Willis had also tried to hire him to manage the Trump case. The prosecution was trying to show that Mr. Wade was not Ms. Willis’s first choice, to establish that she didn’t hire him for personal gain.

Mr. Barnes, a prominent Georgia lawyer who represented a Michael Jordan-like figure to the other lawyers in the courtroom, said he turned Ms. Willis down because the money wasn’t good enough, and he didn’t want to deal with hate and vitriol for prosecuting Mr. Trump. “I wasn’t going to live with bodyguards for the rest of my life,” he said.

It could be a while before the judge rules.

After adjourning, Judge McAfee said he would meet in private with Mr. Bradley and his attorney to discuss questions regarding attorney-client privilege and an accusation of sexual assault against Mr. Bradley while he worked with Mr. Wade. Mr. Bradley emphatically denied the allegation, and the judge did not allow further testimony about it from other witnesses.

The judge said he would then determine a date for lawyers to make their closing arguments on the conflict-of-interest question. It could happen late next week, or the following week, he said, meaning that there will be no quick resolution to the attempt to disqualify the lead prosecutors.

Ms. Willis’s office charged Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies in August 2023 with plotting to subvert the 2020 election results. Four of the defendants have pleaded guilty."
NYTFEED020240312ek3c00899,"After Ukrainian Strikes, Russia Fires Top Naval Commander","American officials estimated that Ukraine, a country without a traditional navy, has sunk 15 Russian ships in the past six months.

The Kremlin has fired its top naval commander, the biggest fallout yet from a series of devastating attacks by Ukraine on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, according to a Ukrainian and a Western official.","Adm. Nikolai Yevmenov, the head of the Russian Navy for the past five years, was removed from command and replaced by the head of the Russia’s Northern Fleet.

Russian publications, citing anonymous sources, reported on Sunday that Admiral Yevmenov had been fired. The Financial Times, citing Ukrainian officials, reported the development on Monday. The Russian government, however, has declined to confirm any of the personnel changes.

U.S. officials have assessed that while Kyiv’s counteroffensive last year in eastern and southern Ukraine largely failed, its strikes on the Crimean Peninsula and attacks on the Black Sea Fleet were unexpectedly effective.

The victories have been all the more surprising because Ukraine does not have a traditional navy or a fleet of warships. Instead, Ukraine has used sea drones and missiles to attack Russian ships.

U.S. officials believe Ukraine has sunk 15 Russian ships in the past six months. European officials have said the naval victories have reopened the western Black Sea, allowing Ukraine to again ship grain from Odesa.

A Ukrainian military intelligence official said that Admiral Yevmenov’s removal from command was directly related to the loss of Russian ships.

Ukraine estimates that a third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which once numbered 80 ships, has been destroyed since the war began two years ago. The April 2022 sinking of the Moskva, the Russian flagship, with a Ukrainian-built missile was one of Kyiv’s great symbolic victories.

But the more recent campaign has been as important for practical gains. As a result of the attacks, Russia has moved its fleet back from Ukraine’s coast and out of the western Black Sea.

The Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said on Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had “basically won the war over the control of the western half of the Black Sea.”

“And Ukrainian grain is now again flowing through the Bosporus to Africa and China, which are Ukraine’s traditional markets,” Mr. Sikorski told reporters in Washington at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.

At a Senate hearing on Monday, William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said Ukraine would be able to conduct more strikes against Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet if the United States provided additional military assistance.

“Ukraine can continue to exact costs against Russia, not only with deep penetration strikes in Crimea, but also against its Black Sea Fleet, continuing this success, which has resulted in 15 Russian ships sunk over the course of the last six months,” said Mr. Burns, who wrote in an article this year that Ukraine should double down on such tactics.

Ukrainian military analysts said the decision to replace the top naval commander was logical, given that Russian efforts to defend its fleet from attacks have failed.

“What did the Russians do to increase the effectiveness of countering our strikes?” Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, told the Ukrainian news media. “Nothing. They currently have no effective solution to increase the security of their warships. The only viable solution they managed to implement was to flee from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk.”

Russian publications have reported that Admiral Yevmenov will be replaced by the head of Russia’s Northern Fleet, Adm. Aleksandr A. Moiseyev. Admiral Yevmenov, however, is still listed as the naval commander in chief on the Russian military’s official website.

“There are decrees classified as secret,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Monday. “I cannot comment on them. There were no open decrees published about this.”

Instead, Russia’s military put out statements regarding naval operations, including one on Tuesday about Russian naval ships participating in joint exercises with Iran and China in the Gulf of Oman.

It is not the first time that questions about the leadership of the Russian Navy have gone unanswered in public.

In February, Russian Telegram channels that follow the country’s military reported that the Black Sea Fleet’s top officer had been removed, but he is still listed as the commander of the fleet on the Russian military’s website.

Last year, Ukrainian authorities claimed to have killed the same commander, but Russia quickly rolled out footage of him giving an interview to prove he was alive."
NYTFEED020240215ek2f005h9,"Losing Ground, Ukraine Seeks New Positions Around Avdiivka","As Russian forces breach a supply line and seek to encircle opposing soldiers, Ukraine’s commanders maneuver to “more advantageous positions.”

Ukrainian soldiers are withdrawing from positions in the shattered town of Avdiivka after advancing Russian forces breached a critical supply line and threatened to encircle scores of Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian military officials and soldiers said on Thursday.","Dmytro Lykhovii, a spokesman for Ukrainian forces fighting in the area, said the Ukrainians were “maneuvering” and “sometimes withdrawing to more advantageous positions and sometimes repelling enemy advances.”

He also said military commanders had set up a backup logistical route to the town to transport much needed supplies to Ukraine’s beleaguered troops.

The battle, Mr. Lykhovii said, was dynamic and changing by the hour as the two sides engaged in fierce urban combat. But his comments suggested the fighting had taken another ominous turn for Kyiv’s forces, potentially presaging their withdrawal from a town reduced to ruins by months of horrendous bombardment.

In a war of mostly small territorial gains, the capture of Avdiivka would be the Russians’ most significant battlefield achievement since taking Bakhmut last May.

Signs of Ukraine’s deteriorating hold on Avdiivka have been evident for several weeks. Ukraine recently rotated out soldiers from the 110th Brigade, which had played a vital role in the defense of the city for two years but were exhausted and severely depleted after months of brutal combat. Soldiers from the elite Third Assault Brigade were sent in to shore up Ukraine’s forces but noted that they were being sent into a situation that was already “extremely critical.”

“Avdiivka is hell,” the brigade’s commander, Andrii Biletskyi, said in a statement. The situation in the city was “ precarious and unstable,” he said, with the Russians able to rotate troops and deploy more resources to the fight.

“We are forced to fight 360 degrees against new brigades that the enemy is deploying,” he said.

Avdiivka, which is less than 10 miles from the Russian occupied city of Donetsk, has withstood months of relentless Russian assaults aimed at encircling the stronghold.

However, as U.S. military assistance stopped flowing and commanders were forced to start rationing ammunition, the Russians managed to gain two footholds within the town itself.

As Russian warplanes pounded Avdiivka with powerful guided bombs, its small assault units stormed through the ruins. The Ukrainians have turned to drones to help thwart Russian advances. But a recent stretch of foggy and rainy weather has limited the use of drones by both sides.

With the Ukrainians forced to conserve ammunition, small bands of Russian assault units were able to amass within the city itself.

“The Russians are throwing everything they have left just to symbolically take the city,” a Ukrainian soldier said when reached by phone, insisting on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “From a strategic point of view, the city no longer matters. And it’s only advantageous for us to hold it to make the losses for the Russkies as high as possible.

Another soldier fighting in the city said it was “just horrible” and the “only thing to do is pray.”

The Russian units are now advancing from the south, threatening to cut off Ukrainian forces in the southern part of city, and the north, where they have now crossed a key supply line in several places.

“The supply and evacuation of Avdiivka has become challenging, but an alternative logistics route, prepared in advance, has been activated,” Mr. Lykhovii said.

The Russians’ ultimate goal, he said, is to encircle the hulking Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, which could be used by Ukrainian forces to mount a last stand in the city should they be forced to pull out of residential areas entirely.

Ukraine’s new top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, is under close scrutiny for how he handles Avdiivka. While military analysts agree that Ukraine has inflicted far steeper losses on the Russians than it suffered during months of fighting, the urban combat that typifies the endgame can be far more costly for both sides.

In the nine-month long fight for Bakhmut, it was the final bloody months of fighting across a bombed-out city that took the heaviest toll on both sides. General Syrsky was widely criticized for ordering his soldiers to fight inside the city long after it was clear Bakhmut would be lost. The fight for Avdiivka, a small city of 30,000 before the war but now just lifeless ruins spread across 12 square miles, has only recently descended into street fighting.

At the same time as General Syrsky has to establish trust at home, he has to plan for the future unsure what assistance his forces will get from their chief military backer, the United States.

A bill that would provide $60 billion in urgently needed military assistance is facing stiff resistance from Republicans in the House of Representatives.

“Avdiivka is at risk of falling under Russian control,” John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters on Thursday. “In very large part, this is happening because the Ukrainian forces on the ground are running out of artillery ammunition.”

The failure of Congress to deliver a new $60 billion aid package, he said, was being paid for by Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield.

“The cost of inaction by the Congress is stark,” he said. “Russian forces are now reaching the Ukrainian trenches actually in Avdiivka and are beginning to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses.”

Russia launched another wave of 26 ballistic and cruise missiles at cities across Ukraine early Thursday. Ukrainian air defense teams were only able to shoot down 50 percent of the barrage, a sign that decreased air defense capabilities were taking a toll.

“We need additional missiles or systems to continue conducting effective air defense battles,” Yuri Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said after the attack. “We need missiles not only to destroy Russia’s cruise or ballistic missiles but also to deter Russian aviation from approaching Ukrainian-controlled territory.”

NYTFEED020240311ek3b009c5,"Haiti’s Leader, Under Growing Pressure, Says He Will Resign","With violence overrunning his country, Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he would step down once a transitional council was established. But it was unclear when that would happen.

Haiti’s prime minister, who has come under growing pressure to resign as gangs have overrun the country, said late Monday that he would step down once a transitional council had been established, to pave the way for the election of a new president and help restore stability.","“The government that I lead will withdraw immediately after the installation of this council,” Prime Minister Ariel Henry said in a speech posted on social media. Referring to the chaos in Haiti, he said, “It hurts us and it revolts us to see all these people dying. The government that I lead cannot remain insensitive to this situation.”

But it was far from clear when Mr. Henry, who had been under growing pressure to step down both in Haiti and abroad, would actually do so.

Leaders from Caribbean nations, who have led the push to create a transitional council, met for discussions in Jamaica on Monday but said no plan had been finalized. Guyana’s president, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, who leads Caricom, a union of 15 Caribbean countries, said that “we still have a long way to go.”

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who attended the meeting in Kingston, Jamaica’s capital, announcedthat the United States would provide an additional $100 million in aid toward a United Nations-backed multinational security mission planned to deploy to Haiti. He also pledged an additional $33 million in humanitarian aid, bringing the U.S. commitments to $333 million.

“We can help. We can help restore a foundation of security,” Mr. Blinken said. “Only the Haitian people can, and only the Haitian people should determine their own future, not anyone else.”

Mr. Henry left Haiti for Kenya in early March to finalize an agreement for the multinational force, led by the East African nation, to deploy and take on the gangs. Since then, he has been stranded outside his country while gang members wreak havoc and demand his resignation.

Mr. Henry, who has been staying in Puerto Rico, did not attend Monday’s meeting, and it was unclear if he had taken part remotely in the discussion.

After months of delays, Haiti and Kenya signed an agreement this month to move forward with the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to the Caribbean nation. President William Ruto of Kenya said his country had a “historic duty” to press ahead because “peace in Haiti is good for the world as a whole.”

Kenya’s interior minister, Kithure Kindiki, announced Monday that the mission was in the “predeployment stage” and that all other programs and enforcement measures related to the deployment were already in place.

So far, however, there is no clear timeline for when the multinational force will deploy.

“We are deeply distressed that it is already too late for too many who have lost far too much at the hands of criminal gangs,” said Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica. “The fear of the situation in Haiti worsening to become a civil war is now a real one. We are all agreed that this cannot be allowed to happen, not in our hemisphere.”

Haiti has spiraled into a state of extreme unrest since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 led to widespread gang violence. To date, the country has no president nor any other elected national officials.

Mr. Henry was sworn in as prime minister only two weeks after Mr. Moïse’s killing. But Haitians have not yet been able to choose a democratically elected successor.

The current unrest is on a scale not seen in decades. The recent escalation of violence, gang attacks on police stations and even coordinated assaults on two prisons have left Haitians to deal with a humanitarian disaster as access to food, water and health care has been severely curtailed.

Over the weekend, U.S. forces evacuated nonessential U.S. citizen workers from the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and added more security personnel, according to a statement from the Defense Department’s Southern Command. It said no Haitians were included in the airlift."
NYTFEED020240323ek3n000gp,Modi’s Party Doesn’t Control All of India. But He’s Working on It.,"As an election nears, political strife between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition-held states is straining the federal formula that holds India together.

It is the final frontier for India’s most powerful leader in decades.","Narendra Modi, over his 10 years as prime minister, has made it his mission to turn a complex and diverse country of 1.4 billion people into something approaching a monolith dominated by his sweeping Hindu nationalist vision.

The news media, the national legislature, civil society, sometimes even the courts — all have largely been bent to his will. But one critical group of holdouts remains: some of India’s richest states, the engine of its rapid growth.

The future shape of the world’s largest democracy — and its economic trajectory — may rest on the power struggle that has ensued.

Mr. Modi, who is well placed to win a third term in a national election that will begin on April 19, is wielding an increasingly heavy hand in what his opponents call an unfair effort to drive out the governments of the states his party does not control.

They accuse Mr. Modi’s administration of delaying federal money for major projects; of jailing or hounding opposition leaders while shielding anyone who joins the prime minister’s party; of obstructing the delivery of basic services; and of throwing state politics into chaos.

The tensions are tearing at India’s delicate federal formula of power sharing and political competition, the glue holding the country together across 28 states and eight territories.

Regional leaders have described the behavior of the central government, which holds more power than in federal systems like the United States’, as that of a colonial overlord. In the south, the most developed and innovative part of India, officials have spoken of a “separate nation” for their region if the “patterns of injustice” continue.

Mr. Modi and his lieutenants have in turn accused the state leaders of harboring a “separatist mind-set” and pursuing politics that could “break the nation.”

India’s move toward more centralized governance could hurt its overall growth, analysts say, as such efforts have done in the past. Big national spending programs focus on basic development problems that the south mostly solved decades ago. If that region’s freedom to make investments based on its own needs is restricted, the effects could be far-reaching.

“It is ultimately self-destructive,” said P. Thiaga Rajan, a cabinet minister in the government of the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Modi offers a simple solution: for the states governed by parties other than his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., to come on board.

He often draws on automotive terminology to make his pitch. Those states, he says, could benefit from what he calls a “double engine” government, with one party — his own — working in sync at both the national and state levels.

If they do not comply, the states get wrench after wrench thrown into the works of their governments, officials say, making it difficult for them to deliver on election promises. The B.J.P., relentlessly expanding its base, waits in the wings.

Last month, the chief ministers of about a half-dozen states staged a dramatic demonstration near the seat of federal power in New Delhi.

With posters reading, “Our Blood, Our Sweat, Our Tax,” hanging behind them, they complained that Mr. Modi was using his outsize control over the distribution of revenues collected across India to entrench his party and hobble their own state governments.

At the same time, Mr. Modi was on a final lap of the country before the announcement of the election dates. In opposition states, he combined promises of billions of dollars in infrastructure and welfare projects with scathing criticism of the local parties.

They are scathing of him, too. They have repeatedly sued state governors appointed by New Delhi, who hold largely ceremonial roles, over complaints that they are stalling the work of elected governments.

“You’re playing with fire,” India’s chief justice, Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud, told the central government after the governor in the opposition-controlled state of Punjab repeatedly prevented legislative work. “Will we continue to be a parliamentary democracy?”

In Tamil Nadu, officials said they were struggling to expand a subway line in the capital city, Chennai, because Mr. Modi’s administration was dragging its feet on New Delhi’s share of the funding.

In Kerala, on India’s southwestern coast, the state government is suing the Modi administration over what it says are arbitrary borrowing limits that have thrown the state’s budget into disarray and delayed payments.

In the western state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, India’s financial and entertainment capital, Mr. Modi’s officials have splintered the state’s two largest parties through a mix of pressure from investigative agencies and offers of incentives. Such “smash and grab” politics, as critics have branded it, has paved the way for the B.J.P. to emerge as a kingmaker in a coalition government.

In the Delhi capital region, the B.J.P. appears hellbent on destroying a smaller party that swept to power promising to improve basic services. The territory’s elected government has been stripped of important powers, and federal agencies have bogged down the top leaders of the party, Aam Aadmi, in corruption cases.

The party’s deputy leader and a key cabinet minister have been in jail for over a year. On Thursday, in a dramatic nighttime raid, government agents arrested Arvind Kejriwal, the party’s leader and Delhi’s chief minister, whom they have accused of financial crimes. He is the first serving chief minister to be arrested.

The bitter political dispute in Delhi is evident in overflowing sewage in parts of the city and long lines outside government hospitals.

Aam Aadmi sought to improve hospitals in part by relying on outside contractors to enter patient data. But the plan has been caught in the crossfire between Mr. Modi’s officials and the territory’s elected government, and the contractors pulled their staff from many hospitals after salaries were delayed for months.

“In their political fighting, it is the public that suffers,” said Adit Kumar, a cloth-seller who has diabetes, who, along with his wife, was waiting outside a crowded hospital in New Delhi one recent day.

Saurabh Bhardwaj, an Aam Aadmi official in Delhi, said Mr. Modi’s intention was clear: to push the country toward one-party rule.

“You reduced the state government’s work so much that people start saying that it’s better to bring the B.J.P. and only they can deliver,” Mr. Bhardwaj said. “That means the federal structure will collapse.”

The biggest federal-state fault line pits the more prosperous south against Mr. Modi’s support base in the north.

Except for a brief period in the state of Karnataka when the B.J.P. took control by orchestrating defections, the party has been unable to win power in the five southern states.

Officials there say that Mr. Modi is trying to hold them back for their refusal to buy in to his brand of politics, including his party’s stirring of Hindu-Muslim tensions and its push to make Hindi — which is not widely spoken in the south — a national language.

The resentment is amplified by complaints that the south gets proportionally less in return for the tax money it sends to New Delhi. Because the northern states have large populations and are far behind in basic development, they get a larger share of the revenues.

There are also serious concerns in the south that the redistribution of parliamentary seats once a long-delayed national census is finally held will punish the south for its success in reducing birthrates, a key to its relative affluence.

With its earlier investments in infrastructure, education and public health — the result of a unique mix of political, cultural and historical differences in the south — the region is better placed to propel India’s ambition for high-end manufacturing. Mr. Modi’s politics-driven approach, his opponents say, could undercut his ambitions for building India into a major economic power.

The federal finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, rejected claims that revenues were being unfairly distributed, saying the central government was “releasing, and releasing on time,” the states’ share.

“We want every part of the country to prosper,” Mr. Modi said in Parliament after the state leaders’ protest in New Delhi, casting himself as a strong proponent of “competitive, cooperative federalism.”

In pressuring state governments, analysts say, Mr. Modi is simply exploiting structural flaws in India’s Constitution, which created a republic — a quasi-federal union of states — after the British left in 1947.

The Indian National Congress party, which ruled over India uncontested in the first decades after independence, abused the outsize constitutional powers given to the central government over fiscal matters to quash the rise of competitors.

Starting in the late 1980s, however, the decline of Congress ushered in an era of coalition politics, with regional parties finding representation in New Delhi.

This was also the period when India opened its heavily centralized economy to the free market. As growth followed, the distribution of resources was subject to more push and pull between the central and state governments.

“The emergence of regional powers made the center commit to certain principles,” said Kalaiyarasan A., an assistant professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies. “The 1990s was a golden period of federalism.”

Today, Mr. Modi is seeking to remake Indian federalism with his “double engine” push.

In opposition-held states, Mr. Modi has offered infrastructure and welfare projects, branded with his name or that of his office, to pitch himself as India’s only driver of development and growth.

In engaging in joint projects, the state parties face a political cost: They will get the money only if they agree to the Modi branding.

And if they resist?

In 2022, Ms. Sitharaman, the finance minister, stopped at a shop in the southern state of Telangana that distributed rice rations as part of a joint program in which the central government provided the larger share of the funding. Mr. Modi’s picture was not displayed there. Ms. Sitharaman lashed out at state officials.

“This is the work that our prime minister is doing for his people,” Ms. Sitharaman said. “Our people will come and install the prime minister’s photo, and you will, as district administrator, ensure that shall not be removed, that shall not be torn, that shall not be affected.”"
NYTFEED020240304ek34001rx,South Korea Moves to Suspend Licenses of Thousands of Protesting Doctors,"The drastic step came after weeks of protests from interns and residents opposed to a government plan to increase medical school admissions.

The South Korean government on Monday said that it was moving to suspend the licenses of thousands of doctors who walked off the job nearly two weeks ago, threatening to escalate a dispute that has shaken the nation’s health care system.","The announcement came after thousands of physicians, nurses and other medical professionals took to the streets on Sunday, rallying with banners that read: “Doctors are not criminals!”

For more than a month, young doctors have been in a high-stakes dispute with the government over the future of health care in the country. Nearly 10,000 interns and residents, about a tenth of all doctors in the nation, have walked off the job, with most ignoring a Thursday deadline to return to work. On Monday, the government said it would begin to suspend the licenses of around 7,000 of those doctors.

But two weeks after the walkout, it remains unclear how the disagreement will be resolved.

“Why would we want to go back after the government has treated us like the bad guys and has not addressed our demands?” said Lee Haeju, 32, who until recently was a resident at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.

Dr. Lee — who said that she was so sleep deprived during her first year of residency that she felt like she operated on a 48-hour cycle instead of 24 — and her cohort have long complained about the pressures they face.

They say some of them do not even make minimum wage, their work conditions are Dickensian and that they are overburdened by complaints from litigation-happy patients. The authorities, they say, have long ignored systemic issues that made specializations like dermatology and cosmetic surgery more lucrative than essential services like emergency care.

Last month, the government issued a new health care policy that it said would address a longstanding shortage of doctors by increasing medical school admissions by about 65 percent a year. But interns and residents, known as trainee doctors, said the government was continuing to ignore the real issues facing doctors.

“How many people would actually work in our department?” said Dr. Lee, who specializes in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery.

Surveys show widespread public support for increasing medical school admissions, the quota for which was last raised in 2006. The government points to statistics that show South Korea has one of the fewest doctors per capita in the developed world. And it says that increasing the number of doctors is crucial in a country with a rapidly aging society.

Facing legal threats, hundreds of trainee doctors have returned to work, but the vast majority of them continue to protest.

The orders were issued to “prevent serious hazards posed by the collective actions of trainee doctors,” Cho Kyoo-hong, the health minister, said in a written reply to questions.

Under South Korean law, the government can force some doctors back to work to avoid a disruption of care. Violators may face a fine of up to 30 million won ($22,000) or jail time of up to three years.

For now, patients have been directed to smaller hospitals and clinics. Major hospitals have had up to half of their operations delayed, and nurses have been allowed to assume some of the duties of doctors. The government has opened military hospitals and increased operating times for public clinics, and while there have been disruptions, the health system has not buckled.

Trainee doctors are a crucial cog in the medical system in South Korea. In major hospitals, they often make up a third of staff and often are the first caregivers to attend to patients.

Park Dan, 33, said he wanted to be an emergency room doctor to save lives. As a resident at Severance Hospital in Seoul, one of South Korea’s biggest hospitals, he said he worked 100-hour weeks, often saw 20 patients every 60 minutes, and had to hold off going to the bathroom for hours on end.

“I thought my own life might be cut short in my effort to save others,” said Mr. Park, who is also the head of the Korean Intern Resident Association.

South Korea has a universal health care system that provides care for all citizens. But doctors argue that the government has underinvested in essential services, making specializations like emergency care and pediatrics less financially appealing to physicians. The government has said it would spend about 10 trillion won, or $7.5 billion, on essential health services over the next five years.

Early-career doctors in South Korea typically work longer weeks and earn less than their counterparts in the United States. Interns and residents make about $3,000 a month, which is less than minimum wage, considering their long workweeks, according to Lee Jaehee, a lawyer who is representing some of the doctors who have walked out. Their shifts cap out at 36 hours, and their workweek can stretch to 88 hours.

For trainee doctors, the situation is “similar to the Industrial Revolution when young boys and girls were forced to work in factories,” said Dr. Lim Hyun Taek, the president of the Korean Pediatric Association.

This is not the first time doctors have protested a government plan to increase the medical school admissions quota. In 2020, a monthlong strike by doctors forced the authorities to shelve a similar plan. But this time, the government has so far remained steadfast in its position and criticism, arguing that the walkout has compromised the health and safety of the public.

The doctors reject that notion.

“We’ve cried with patients and have held their hands along the way to their recovery,” Dr. Lee said. “We’re not criminals.”"
NYTFEED020240327ek3r000ul,"Happy-Go-Lucky Australia Is Feeling Neither Happy, Nor Lucky","After enjoying decades of prosperity, the country has hit stubborn economic turbulence.

For nearly three decades, Australia seemed to have a sort of get-out-of-jail card that allowed it to glide through the dot-com bust and the global financial crisis without a recession, while its citizens mostly enjoyed high wages, affordable housing and golden prospects.","When a recession did arrive, in 2020, it was because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

But four years later, Australia has been unable to shake off some of the headwinds, including a high cost of living — the price of bread has risen 24 percent since 2021 — a choppy labor market and rising inequality. While these and similar issues are also troubling nations like Britain and the United States, they are particularly stinging to many in Australia, which has long seen itself as the “lucky country.”

Australia is among the wealthiest, most resource-rich and stable countries in the world. But millions of residents are experiencing levels of hardship not seen in many decades. They say they are struggling to put food on the table, pay for housing and health care and cover their utility bills. And many young Australians are confronting a reality that their ancestors never had to: that they will be worse off than their parents or grandparents.

Robyn Northam, 28, once dreamed of becoming a hairdresser. But rising rent and exorbitant child care costs for her two children have put training out of reach. Just two generations ago, she said, her grandmother raised a family in her own home as a single parent, while working part-time as a nurse.

“If you’re an average Australian, that’s virtually impossible,” said Ms. Northam, a content creator in Cairns who, with her partner, pays 600 Australian dollars, or about $400, a week in rent. “It’s a totally different world now.”

Australians are paying more for almost everything. The pandemic ushered in soaring inflation, which has since softened, though at 3.4 percent it remains relatively high. Rents in some Melbourne neighborhoods are up almost 50 percent year-over-year, and rental affordability is at its lowest in at least 17 years. Consumer sentiment has barely budged since tumbling in 2020.

Homeowners are also under pressure. Australian mortgages are generally fixed for a few years at a time, and as the central bank has tried to rein in prices by raising interest rates, rates have tripled to 6.7 percent in recent years.

This strain has resulted in a spike in working families seeking support. Over 16 years, said Dave McNamara, the chief executive of Foodbank Victoria, “through bush fires and pandemics, I have not seen anything on the scale that we’re currently experiencing of people from all walks of life needing food relief.”

“Things are a lot worse than they were prepandemic, and there’s little inspiration for us to be optimistic,” said Nikki Hutley, an independent economist in Sydney. “Everyone’s doing it really tough.”

Economists have long argued that too much Australian wealth is tied up in the housing market, even as shoddy policy, construction shortages and high immigration have brought an already low housing supply to a crunch point.

Polling by the think tank Per Capita last year found that fewer than one in four Australians who did not own a home expected to be able to do so. “That’s not necessarily the be-all and end-all, if you’ve got a really stable rental system,” said Ms. Hutley, “but we have terrible laws in this country.”

Australian renters have fewer protections than in most other wealthy nations. Though laws vary between states, landlords have relatively few constraints on how much they can raise rent; renters face regular “inspections” of their homes; and the government offers large tax concessions for landlords.

A shortage of rentals has also sent rents skyrocketing in some neighborhoods, pushing young people farther and farther out of cities. In Sydney, the exodus of young families, one recent report warned, risks creating a “city with no grandchildren.”

Talitha Vermeulen, 25, has been looking to move within that city with her partner for the last four months. Often, available properties are leased before viewings can even occur, she said. “It’s just been frustrating to not even get a chance to see the place.”

With its wealth, stability and natural resources, Australia has more advantages than most other nations — life expectancy rates and wages are still among the world’s highest, with wage growth outstripping inflation last year. The stock market is trading near record levels.

Yet it is not evident that it is living up to its ample potential, said Julianne Schultz, an academic and the author of “The Idea of Australia.” “The thing that I keep coming back to is: It could be so much better,” she said, adding: “It’s a sort of lack of ambition.”

Though Australians often proudly refer to “the lucky country,” the comment by the academic and writer Donald Horne was originally intended as one of reproach to the country’s leaders, whom he saw as incurious and unimaginative.

And despite the country’s plentiful bounty and its oft-stated love of egalitarian values, Australia’s wealth is increasingly unevenly distributed, as the nation joins the ranks of others confronting rising inequality and economic and generational strains.

Economic unhappiness has translated to the lowest levels of “life satisfaction” since records began 22 years ago, according to the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index. The high cost of living, troubling global politics and rising inequality are all contributing factors, said Kate Lycett, the lead researcher. “It’s a huge number of people who are struggling to make ends meet,” she said.

On a recent Monday morning, people waited outside a food bank at a church in Richmond, a neighborhood of Melbourne. The food bank helps more than 100 households, and demand has increased sharply over the last six months, said Francis Flood, the coordinator.

“We’ve seen a lot of people who work but can’t make it through to the end of the month,” he said. “We’re definitely helping people who, if you saw them on the street, you wouldn’t think would be using a food bank.”

Even some who own their homes outright are struggling. Tracey Shepherd, 60, lives a short walk from the beach, in picture-perfect Surfers Paradise, Queensland. A former public servant, she has health issues that have made finding permanent work a struggle, and she is surviving on her retirement savings while she awaits a decision on a disability benefit.

With the high price of groceries and increases in maintenance fees on her apartment, life feels precarious, she said. “When I was younger, they’d say we’re the lucky country. It’s not like that now.”"
NYTFEED020240324ek3o0008d,Senegal Votes in an Election That Almost Didn’t Happen,"The top opposition politician, Ousmane Sonko, is barred from running. So Sunday’s vote is widely seen as a choice between his handpicked candidate and the departing president’s designated successor.

She had badgered her friends and family to persuade them to vote for a major change of government. And on Friday, Aminata Faye, 22, stood at the front of a stadium in Senegal, in the city of Mbour, waiting to hear the opposition politician who had inspired her — and his presidential candidate — in the last stop in a breakneck campaign.","“They’re the only ones saying they’re going to change the system,” said Ms. Faye, a college student.

The West African nation of Senegal votes for a new president Sunday, in an election that many young people see as a chance to overhaul the political and economic order. And it has been a nail-biting run-up.

Last month, the incumbent president, Macky Sall, had called off the election with only three weeks to go. Then he agreed to hold it after all. And suddenly, last week, he released from jail the pugnacious opposition figure many see as his nemesis — Ousmane Sonko — along with the man Mr. Sonko is backing for president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye.

The whiplash-inducing twists and turns have left many Senegalese relieved that the election is happening at all, and that so far their widely lauded democracy appears to be still intact.

People arrived early Sunday morning at polling stations across the country, forming orderly queues and waiting their turns to cast their ballots, the tranquil scenes in schoolyards and under trees standing in contrast to the drama of the previous month.

The initial turnout appeared to be high, with women, young people and older people represented. Many posted photographs on social media of their fingers stained with pink ink, indicating that they had voted.

While there are 19 candidates in all, many experts think the election will go to a runoff between Mr. Faye and the governing party candidate, Prime Minister Amadou Ba. It is prohibited to publish opinion polls in Senegal during election season, so there is nothing concrete to indicate who is favored to win.

But ask most young people who they are supporting, and they will mention Mr. Sonko, whose name is not even on the ballot.

Thousands of young people flowed into the Mbour stadium to see him on Friday evening, the air filling with the honk of vuvuzelas. Binta Cissé, a 30-year-old cleaner, looked around at the sea of T-shirts bearing the faces of Mr. Sonko and his candidate, Mr. Faye, a 43-year-old former tax inspector.

“We can see ourselves in them,” Ms. Cissé said.

The campaigning has happened at a breakneck pace, and during Ramadan, when most people in this predominantly Muslim country fast during the day. At night, political convoys rushed through the sandy alleyways of Dakar, the coastal capital, pumping out music and slogans and distributing fliers. Posters bearing politicians’ beaming faces were hastily pasted up on roadside billboards.

The prime minister, Mr. Ba, hurriedly quit his position to go on the campaign trail. Mr. Sonko’s protégée, Mr. Faye, immediately hit the road after getting out of jail. He had been held on defamation charges and contempt of court, after he accused magistrates of persecuting Mr. Sonko.

A country on the African continent’s westernmost tip, Senegal has watched as some of its neighbors — like Mali, to the east, and Guinea, to the south — have been overtaken by coups in recent years.

But Senegal, observers say, is different.

It has never had a coup d’état. The country’s powerful Sufi brotherhoods — Muslim communities guided by revered spiritual leaders — are seen as a stabilizing force. Its military prides itself on staying out of politics.

Experts say that while Senegal has been badly damaged by Mr. Sall’s authoritarian turn, the country’s reputation as a democratic outpost in a crisis-hit region has held.

But Senegal faces many of the same problems that have bedeviled its neighbors in West Africa — such as persistent poverty, an education deficit and a lack of jobs, particularly for young people. These are the issues this election is likely to turn on — and a major reason Mr. Sonko has garnered such a strong youth following.

Over the last decade, 35-year-old Lamine Ndao has watched Senegal’s economy grow under Mr. Sall’s administration — large oil and gas fields have recently been discovered, and major infrastructure projects completed. But he has been left behind, he said.

For 10 years, ever since he received a degree in tourism from a university in Dakar, he’s been looking for a job. And most of his friends are in the same situation, he said — except the ones who joined the political party in power.

“If you have political connections, you can work,” he said as he watched gleaming SUV’s drive by on one of Dakar’s busiest roads a few days before the election. “Do you find that fair? It’s not.”

Young people like Mr. Ndao were pivotal in assuring Mr. Sall’s ascent to the presidency.

Mr. Sall’s predecessor, Abdoulaye Wade, began as a stalwart defender of democracy who promised change and ran for president four times before he was elected — twice. Then he ran for a third term in 2012, arguing that the constitutional two-term limit did not apply to him. But a lively youth movement persuaded hundreds of thousands of young Senegalese to head to the polls, and Mr. Wade lost to Mr. Sall.

Twelve years later, this February, many Senegalese said they were astounded to see Mr. Sall try to call off the election. They were also stunned to see the scenes from Parliament, where the police threw out opposition lawmakers so that the bill confirming the cancellation could be pushed through.

Mr. Ndao, the unemployed college graduate, voted for Mr. Sall in 2012. In 2019, he said he felt so disillusioned that he didn’t bother to vote. He said that while he wants to build his life in Senegal, he has been considering risking his life on a rickety boat to Europe, or following the thousands of West Africans now trying to migrate to the United States on circuitous routes via Nicaragua.

He hoped it wouldn’t come to that, he said: He and all his friends are pinning their hopes on the man who has made a career out of excoriating elites, accusing prominent politicians of corruption and promising change: Mr. Sonko.

Nobody can vote for Mr. Sonko, who was barred from running after being convicted of defamation and of corrupting a minor, after a young massage parlor employee accused him of rape. So they will vote for Mr. Faye instead, Mr. Ndao said.

As the light faded over Ouakam, a Dakar suburb, on Tuesday evening, young volunteers from Mr. Sonko’s party handed out free dates and coffee to Muslims breaking the fast.

Bassirou Faye, a 24-year-old bus driver who coincidentally shares the name of the presidential candidate for Mr. Sonko’s party, said that he wasn’t interested in Mr. Sonko at all in the 2019 election. Mr. Sonko came in third, with 16 percent of the vote.

But this time, Mr. Faye said, he will travel the 100 miles to his home city of Bambey just to vote for Mr. Sonko’s candidate.

“Because of all the injustice he has faced, I started following and supporting him,” he said.

Mr. Faye and Mr. Sonko have promised major economic changes, like renegotiating oil and gas contracts, and reforming or leaving the regional currency, which is pegged to the euro.

Analysts say this may scare Senegal’s foreign investors and stall economic progress.

Supporters of Mr. Ba said he was a safe pair of hands who would continue on the same steady trajectory as Mr. Sall, whom many perceive as having overseen orderly progress.

“He’s calm and serene,” said Valéry Kalidou Bonang, 35, an entrepreneur from Kedougou, in Senegal’s east. He said he wanted to see the continuation of Mr. Sall’s program of building infrastructure and improving living conditions, known as Emerging Senegal. “But it’s not a question of the person. It’s a question of the project.”

Mr. Ndao, the tourism graduate, said his father was voting for Mr. Ba, along with many older people who would get up early and go vote, he said, while many young people did not even have voters’ cards.

“Young people are the ones who need change,” he said. “The old ones are on their way out.”"
NYTFEED020240325ek3p002mh,Young Opposition Candidate Set to Become Senegal’s President,"Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who turned 44 on Monday, was little known until he received the backing of Ousmane Sonko, Senegal’s most formidable opposition politician. Both men were released from jail only 10 days ago.

With the concession of his main rival, a young political outsider backed by a powerful opposition figure has won a surprise outright victory in Senegal’s presidential election only 10 days after being released from jail.","Bassirou Diomaye Faye is the anointed candidate of Senegal’s popular and controversial opposition politician Ousmane Sonko. Mr. Faye’s main rival, the governing party candidate Amadou Ba, conceded in a statement congratulating his rival on Monday for winning in the first round.

Mr. Faye, who celebrated his 44th birthday on Monday, will become the West African country’s youngest ever president, and the youngest elected president currently serving in Africa. (There are younger leaders, but they came to power by force.) He had been jailed on charges of defamation and contempt of court, and was awaiting trial.

“I wish him a lot of success, for the well-being of the Senegalese people,” Mr. Ba said in a statement released Monday afternoon that addressed Mr. Faye as president.

The national electoral commission has not yet announced the tally, but Mr. Ba’s concession followed reports by local media that Mr. Faye had won more than 50 percent of the vote, ruling out a runoff.

Mr. Faye and Mr. Sonko have captivated young people by excoriating political elites, pledging to renegotiate contracts with oil and gas companies, and promising “monetary sovereignty” — Senegal is one of 14 countries that use the CFA, a currency pegged to the euro and backed by France.

Mr. Ba, who stepped down as prime minister in order to campaign, was backed by Senegal’s president, Macky Sall. Mr. Sall had served two terms, and for years refused to say whether he would try for a third. He threw the country into chaos when he suddenly called off the election, which was supposed to happen in February, and then, almost as suddenly, changed course.

On Monday, Mr. Sall also congratulated Mr. Faye, saying that the smooth election was a “victory for Senegalese democracy” — a democracy that the outgoing president’s critics had accused him of trying to subvert.

Senegal, a mainly Muslim country of 17 million people, has a history of peaceful transfers of power since gaining independence from France in 1960.

Residents of Dakar, Senegal’s coastal capital, began celebrating at 8 p.m. on Sunday, before many polling stations had even had a chance to count the contents of their ballot boxes. People danced, waved flags, and piled into cars and onto motorcycles, sounding a cacophony of horns and shouting “Get out, Amadou Ba!” as they raced through the streets.

And at midnight, supporters began to sing “Happy Birthday” to Mr. Faye, who has gone from obscurity to winning the presidency in a few short months.

But Mr. Faye was not the only winner. Many Senegalese casting their ballots for him saw him merely as a proxy for Mr. Sonko, 49, a fiery orator who was jailed and barred from running, and who tapped Mr. Faye to run in his place.

Mr. Faye is a former tax collector who was jailed on charges of defamation and contempt of court, after he accused magistrates of persecuting Mr. Sonko, who was himself convicted of defamation and, separately, of corrupting a minor, after he was accused of raping a young massage parlor employee.

Mr. Sonko has been eager to emphasize that a vote for Mr. Faye, known to many as Diomaye, was a vote for him.

“Diomaye is Sonko,” read ubiquitous posters bearing the two men’s youthful, glowing faces.

The two men have very different styles. In contrast with Mr. Sonko’s bombast, Mr. Faye is soft-spoken and serious, some who know him say. He is a keen soccer player who grew up in his family village near the city of Mbour and has two wives. He worked for 15 years in Senegal’s civil service.

“Many young Senegalese identify with him,” said Babacar Ndiaye, a political analyst at the West Africa Think Tank. He said that Mr. Faye had worked extensively on the party’s political program, and had earned a reputation for being ethical and hard-working. When Mr. Sonko chose him to be the presidential candidate in his place, Mr. Ndiaye said, “Everyone thought it was the right choice.”

Mr. Faye has pledged to reduce presidential powers, to make the judiciary more independent, and to reform land ownership. He has also said he will “change the CFA” — the regional currency — though it is unclear whether he and Mr. Sonko intend to reform or replace it.

The election Sunday unspooled peacefully, with many voters arriving early at polling stations and lining up quietly to cast their ballots.

It was in stark contrast to the previous two months, during which it was often unclear whether the poll would take place at all.

In early February, Mr. Sall stunned the nation when he called off the election, saying that there were allegations of corruption that needed investigation at the constitutional council, the country’s highest court.

Then the police occupied Parliament, throwing out opposition lawmakers so that legislation confirming Mr. Sall’s decision could be pushed through. The presidential election was postponed until December.

In the uproar that followed, the constitutional council ruled the delay unlawful, and Mr. Sall performed a U-turn. He agreed to hold the election quickly, and even released Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye from jail, allowing them a quick-fire 10-day campaign.

Many observers saw the turn of events as proof of the resilience of democracy in Senegal, a country in a tough neighborhood. A string of West African countries — like Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali — have experienced coups in recent years, and Senegal has been held up as an outpost of democracy and relative political stability.

Opposition candidates conceded one by one Sunday night through to Monday, congratulating Mr. Faye.

Over the past five years Mr. Sonko has grown his following significantly by excoriating Senegal’s political elites and evoking the vague but charged concept of “sovereignty,” aiming his rhetoric at Senegal’s abundant youth — half of the population is under 19.

And the youth have responded. Thousands have taken to the streets in support of Mr. Sonko, dozens of them losing their lives at the hands of the police.

Despite the crackdowns, young people have continued to show their support for what many simply call “the project” — Mr. Faye’s and Mr. Sonko’s plan for the country.

“I know with the project, many things will change,” said Abalaye Diop, 27, a motorcycle taxi driver who lives in Medina, a busy Dakar neighborhood, on Monday afternoon. “It will be different from the power of Macky Sall.”

Mr. Ba’s camp initially insisted that the result would at worst be a runoff. But by Monday afternoon, in his concession, he wished Mr. Faye the “energy and strength required” to do the job.

His comments echoed some of Mr. Sonko’s, made during a briefing shortly after getting out of jail.

“Once we are in power there will be a lot of challenges,” he said. “People will demand a lot from us, and we owe them a lot.”

NYTFEED020240316ek3g001up,India’s 2024 General Election: What to Know,"* Why does this election matter?

* How does India vote?","* Who is running and who is likely to win?

* When will we find out the results?

* Where can I find out more information?

Why does this election matter?

India is holding its multiphase general elections from April 19 to June 1, in a vote that will determine the political direction of the world’s most populous nation for the next five years.

The usually high-turnout affair, which was formally set on Saturday, is a mammoth undertaking described as the biggest peacetime logistical exercise anywhere.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose power is well entrenched, is seeking a third term. In his decade at the helm, he has projected himself as a champion of India’s development, trying to address some of the basic failures — like antiquated infrastructure and a lack of clean water and toilets — holding the country back from reaching its potential as a major power. But his push to reshape India’s secular democracy as a Hindu-first nation has aggravated the religious and ethnic fault lines in the hugely diverse country.

In a region of frequent political turmoil, India is deeply proud of its nearly undisrupted electoral democracy since its founding as a republic more than 75 years ago. Although independent institutions have come under assault from Mr. Modi’s efforts to centralize power and the ruling party is seen as having an unfair advantage over political fund-raising, voting in India is still seen as free and fair, and results are accepted by candidates.

How does India vote?

India has a parliamentary system of governance. The party leading the majority of the 543 seats in the lower house of the Parliament gets to form the government and appoint as prime minister one of its winning candidates.

The country has over 960 million eligible voters, with about 470 million of them women. Turnout in Indian elections is usually high, with the parliamentary elections in 2019 drawing a 67 percent turnout.

The votes are cast electronically across more than a million polling stations that require about 15 million employees during balloting. To reach every possible voter in Himalayan hamlets and isolated islands, election officials will travel by any means possible, in railroads and helicopters, on horseback and boats.

India’s elections are the most expensive in the world, with political parties spending more than $7 billion in the 2019 parliamentary elections, according to studies. That spending is expected to double in the current elections. In a sign of how much of a factor money is, Indian authorities seized the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars before the last parliamentary election — in cash, gold, liquor and drugs — that they said was meant for bribing voters.

Who is running, and who is likely to win?

Prime Minister Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party holds a strong majority in the 543-seat Parliament. The B.J.P. won 303 seats in 2019, and along with its coalition partners enjoyed a majority of 352 seats.

Although Indian elections are known to throw surprises, Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is well placed to return to power. His party, relentless in trying to expand its base, is rich in cash and has a strong election machinery. Mr. Modi has built on it a multipronged approach that offers everyone something: There is the wider emotional appeal of his Hindu majoritarian ideology for his main base, coupled with a broad range of welfare and infrastructure programs that tries to win new constituencies to the B.J.P.

The opposition has struggled to match Mr. Modi’s appeal.

The Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, ruled India for decades, but it has been reduced to shadow of its former glory in two consecutive national elections. In 2019, it won only 52 seats.

In the lead-up to this parliamentary election, the opposition has tried to unite as one bloc. They are brought together by fears that a third term for Mr. Modi, who has jailed many opposition party leaders and bogged down others in investigations, would further marginalize them.

But the opposition has struggled to pitch a cohesive ideological alternative beyond a criticism of Mr. Modi’s divisive politics, and its bickering over seat-sharing in constituencies often spills out in messy public fights.

When will we find out the results?

Because of India’s vast geography, the voting for the parliamentary election happens over seven phases, and it takes nearly six weeks to complete, from the first region casting its vote to the last. Scheduling is a tricky task, entailing trying to find a sweet spot that factors in climate extremes and is considerate of the frequent cultural and religious festivals across India.

The last stage of voting will be completed on June 1. All results are tallied and announced by end of day on June 4.

NYTFEED020240304ek34004bl,"London Bids Farewell, for Now, to a Beloved, Overstuffed Walrus","A taxidermy gallery known for its bulky centerpiece is closing for a two-year renovation.

Southeast London has temporarily lost one of its most famous residents: a giant taxidermy walrus that has been on display for more than a century.","For most of the past 120 years, the walrus has sat in the middle of the Natural History Gallery at the Horniman Museum and Gardens. The museum displays the collection of Frederick Horniman, a wealthy tea trader who lived in Victorian England.

The gallery, which in addition to the walrus holds other taxidermy animals, skeletons and insects, is being shuttered while the museum redevelops the space, with a focus on “environmental sustainability and a commitment to fighting the climate emergency,” according to the museum’s website. (The rest of the museum, which also includes a large collection of musical instruments and an aquarium, will remain open.)

When the gallery reopens, in 2026, visitors will be able to see the walrus in the same spot where they left him — sitting prominently in the middle of the room atop a fake iceberg, said Louis Buckley, a senior curator at the museum. The collection will include more context about how Mr. Horniman came to own the walrus. The museum’s website notes that Mr. Horniman’s wealth was “reliant on the exploitation of people living in the British Empire.”

“It’s an expression in many ways of the British Empire and its relationship with the colonies and Canada in particular,” Mr. Buckley said.

During his lifetime, Mr. Horniman amassed a collection of ethnographic objects, natural history specimens and musical instruments. When his collection grew too large to fit in his home, he commissioned architects to build a museum, which opened in 1901.

In the renovated gallery, the walrus will “encapsulate a lot of different themes we are exploring,” Mr. Buckley said. Other than a closer look at how Mr. Horniman’s objects arrived in the museum, climate change and humans’ relationship to nature will also be explored.

The walrus is the undeniable showstopper of the collection. It’s the only item in the gallery that’s not in a glass case.

Looking at it, however, might make a visitor feel a bit odd — as though something’s off.

“People describe it as a bit too large,” Mr. Buckley said.

Live walruses have skin folds and wrinkles. The one at the museum does not, though the marks of where those skin folds would be are visible. The walrus, Mr. Buckley said, “is fully plumped up, quite a bit larger than it would have been in life.”

Whoever originally stuffed the animal probably had never seen a walrus, Mr. Buckley said. After all, he added, “they’re difficult animals to observe up close.”

Mr. Horniman bought the walrus around 1886 from an exhibition in London. The walrus itself is probably from the Hudson Bay area of Canada, Mr. Buckley said, although it’s unknown who hunted and killed it.

On Sunday, the overriding mood at the museum was one of enthusiasm and walrus appreciation. Against the sounds of squealing — and sometimes crying — children on a rare sunny March day, visitors said they had made a pilgrimage that day specifically to say goodbye.

“We came to greet the walrus,” said Julia King, one of the visitors. It was her first time seeing the walrus in person. “He’s magnificent,” she said.

Ms. King said she enjoyed looking at the absurd things in life, and the walrus lived up to her expectations.

“He’s obviously the star of Southeast London,” said Sian Thomas, another visitor, who said she found the overstuffed animal important as a way to understand how we look at the world differently than people did in Victorian times, and how our scientific understanding has evolved.

As visitors passed by the walrus on Sunday, many of them took photos, explained the animal to their children and marveled at its size. The walrus’s total weight is unknown, but it takes at least five people to move him, Mr. Buckley said.

“I did not expect it to be so big,” said Kasia Kaniuka, a Londoner who was visiting the museum with her boyfriend because they had heard the gallery was closing. “It’s quite overwhelming.”

For Josh Alford, the gallery’s closure was also the main reason to visit on Sunday. He came to see the walrus from East London. “I expected it to be like a seal size,” Mr. Alford said. “That looks like a horse, to be honest.” (He was quick to add that the animal did look “cute enough to hug.”)

Some said they were sad the walrus would be going away for a while, many of them citing it as a family favorite. Others, who had no idea of the impending closure, were pleased with their serendipitous timing.

“I’m gutted,” said Kara Tritton, who grew up in the area and still lives there. She said she remembered seeing the walrus for the first time as a child, and the impression it made on her. Through the museum, she said, she also felt connected to her great-grandparents, who were local residents and who had most likely visited the walrus as well.

“I absolutely had to come today,” she said. “I’ll miss him. Two years will be a long time.”"
NYTFEED020240322ek3m00001,Giant Neon Eggs and Other Outdoor Art to See in Hong Kong This Spring,"Eye-popping pieces are cropping up around Victoria Harbor this month, just in time for Art Basel Hong Kong.

This month, just before Art Basel Hong Kong begins, an array of artworks — some towering, some glowing, another harking back to old Hong Kong — will pop up outside the walls of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.","Five of these new, large-scale works were commissioned by a department of Hong Kong’s government for its outdoor art project, “Art@Harbour,” the harbor being Victoria Harbor, which separates Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon Peninsula.

Another piece was jointly commissioned by M+, Hong Kong’s contemporary art museum, and Art Basel Hong Kong. That work, a new black-and-white film by the Chinese artist and filmmaker Yang Fudong, “Sparrow on the Sea,” will be projected on the museum’s facade nightly.

One of the “Art@Harbour” projects, “Schrödinger’s Bed,” is by the Hong Kong artist Dylan Kwok.

Mr. Kwok’s work is named after Schrödinger’s cat, the famous thought experiment by the theoretical physicist Erwin Schrödinger.

That experiment, which the scientist proposed as a commentary on quantum mechanics, suggests that, if a cat is inside a sealed box with something which may kill it, it is impossible to know whether the cat is alive or dead until you observe the cat. So, until you open the box, the cat is at once both dead and alive.

Mr. Kwok explained by email that his installation, in Tamar Park, a waterfront green space in the Admiralty district, “consists of nine futuristic daybeds that are placed in a tic-tac-toe alignment. Six inflatable cats in checkerboard patterns are (randomly) seated or lay on six daybeds out of the total of nine.” These outdoor couches are programmed to glow in differing patterns from 6 p.m. to midnight, he added, to surprise visitors sitting on them.

“Laying down on a bench seems to be a taboo in any public park, needless to say,” Mr. Kwok added. “Having a bed as urban furniture is only a daydream.” So, he said, the pieces are meant to provoke conversations about public space.

Mr. Kwok also said the experiment “made us think differently about the nature of reality.”

“The cat in the box can be both dead and alive, at the same time, before observations,” he said. “We can only know if the person sitting on the bench is truly sleeping (or awake) only when trying to wake them up.” The installation, he added, asks observers, “How do we want our public life to be? Can we introduce daybeds in our parks?”

Another piece of the “Art@Harbour” exhibition, also in Tamar Park, is by teamLab, a Tokyo international art collective.

That two-work exhibition, “teamLab: Continuous,” consists of giant glowing ovoids and trees arrayed across land and sea.

The collective explained in a news release that the egg-shaped forms in “Resonating Life which Continues to Stand,” the first of the two works, stand resolutely, no matter where they are.

“The ovoids continue to stand even if they are pushed over by waves, blown by the wind, or pushed by people,” the artists said. “When an ovoid is pushed over, it rises back up on its own and shines brightly.” That light, and the sound the ovoid produces, resonates with other ovoids and trees nearby.

The team added: “When it is quiet and the wind is not blowing and the people nearby are not interacting with the ovoids, their lights begin to flicker slowly.”

According to teamLab, in the second work, “Resonating Trees,” the light of the trees responds to the light of the ovoids. As they respond, the trees may change color.

Another installation in Tamar Park, “Harbour Cup,” by the Hong Kong firm Laab Architects, consists of foosball-inspired sculptures.

Asked about the inspiration for the work, Laab Architects said by email, “When we looked for inspiration at the site, we noticed that a lot of people actually came here to exercise. That’s how the sports theme came about. We want to create an artwork that blends in with people’s daily lives, but with a little something off that breaks people’s habit, or makes people rethink the ways of doing things.”

The firm took the sports theme as a jumping-off point, but then played with it. “‘Harbour Cup’ has no goals on either end and no clear definition of teams, people have to negotiate with each other on how to play,” the architects explained. “Through play, we hope that people can get to talk to each other more, no matter they are family, friends, acquaintances, or strangers.”

The “Art@Harbour” works will be on display from Monday, just before Art Basel opens, through June 2.

“Sparrow on the Sea,” which Mr. Yang filmed in Hong Kong, features what M+ described in a news release as scenes from “picturesque seaside villages” and “nocturnal city streets.”

Mr. Yang said by email that his film was inspired by beloved movies set in Hong Kong, such as “In the Mood for Love,” and that its soundtrack will be provided by the city’s “ambient sounds, of seawater, boats, cars, people and those inside the buildings.”

“Each viewer can have their own unique imagination, combining the sounds that they hear in this city and the visual they see from the work,” he said.

The film will be projected on the museum’s facade from Friday to June 9.

Angelle Siyang-Le, director of Art Basel Hong Kong, said by email that the fair hopes the outdoor art will “attract a diverse range of audiences, both local and international, who are interested in engaging with the vibrant art scenes of Asia.”

“By offering an immersive experience that highlights diverse artistic perspectives, the goal is to connect guests from around the world in Hong Kong,” she said. “This includes art enthusiasts, collectors, curators, scholars and individuals interested in exploring and appreciating contemporary art from Asia and beyond.”

Asked about the importance of interactive art today, Laab Architects said, “We are so used to looking at our phone these days and become unaware of each other’s presence. This is where interactive art comes into play, to disrupt this kind of presence-non-presence situation, to break a little routine, to create genuine connections, even though the connection may just be a fleeting moment.”"
NYTFEED020240315ek3f003s5,Highlights of the Judge’s Decision in the Georgia Trump Case,"The district attorney, Fani T. Willis, was given two choices: have her ex-boyfriend withdraw from the prosecution team or step aside herself.

A judge overseeing the criminal election interference case against former President Donald J. Trump in Georgia declined on Friday to disqualify the district attorney leading the prosecution, Fani T. Willis, over a romantic relationship she had with the lawyer she hired to manage the case, Nathan J. Wade.","But even as the judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, rejected the claim by one of Mr. Trump’s co-defendants, Mike Roman, that the relationship raised an actual conflict of interest by giving Ms. Willis a financial stake in the case, the judge also ruled that it raised “a significant appearance of impropriety.”

The judge gave her two choices: either Mr. Wade leaves her prosecution team, or she and her office must step aside from the case.

Here are highlights from the 23-page ruling:

A combination of factors raises a legitimate question.

Alone, each of the two main issues raised by the defense — that Mr. Wade is being paid by the hour, and that two members of the prosecution team were having a relationship — would not be a problem. But combined, they raise an deeper issue, the judge wrote.

Financial gain was neither proven nor shown to be a motivating factor.

The judge wrote that Willis’s claim that she had reimbursed Mr. Wade in cash for trips they took together was “unusual” and “understandably concerning” but was “not so incredible as to be inherently unbelievable,” and the evidence did not establish that she had received any material benefit as a result of her decision to hire and engage in a romantic relationship with Mr. Wade.

And, more important, the judge found, the evidence demonstrated that financial gain was “not a motivating factor” on Willis’s part in indicting and prosecuting the case.

Willis showed a “tremendous lapse in judgment” and acted unprofessionally.

While deciding that the evidence did not show there was an actual conflict of interest, the judge nevertheless suggested that the prosecutor’s conduct was problematic in a way that others — including an ethics commission and voters — may wish to address.

The situation still raises an “appearance of impropriety.”

Even when no actual conflict exists, the judge wrote, “a perceived conflict in the reasonable eyes of the public threatens confidence in the legal system itself.” The combination of factors that made the question of whether Ms. Willis had a conflict legitimate, he wrote, means such an appearance of impropriety persists in the case.

The judge also wrote that “reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued resulting in some form of benefit to the District Attorney, or even whether the romantic relationship has resumed,” adding that, “As long as Wade remains on the case, this unnecessary perception will persist.”

A lingering “odor of mendacity” means the two cannot continue together on the case.

Expressing skepticism about testimony regarding when the relationship between Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade evolved into a romantic one, the judge portrayed the continued commingling of professional and personal relationships as untenable.

There has been no showing that the two prosecutors’ relationship violated the defendants’ rights or hurt them in any way, the judge wrote, and disqualifying Ms. Willis is unnecessary when there is a less drastic remedy available: Mr. Wade can leave the prosecution team.

A gag order may be coming.

The defense had also asked the judge to disqualify Ms. Willis over public remarks she has made, including at a church in Atlanta on Jan. 14 in which she complained vaguely about her detractors and accused them of playing “the race card.” While finding that her comments did not amount to improperly trying the case in public, the judge nevertheless scolded her and suggested that he may soon issue a gag order to prevent further public comments.

The relationship is an unacceptable distraction.

Summing up, the judge wrote that regardless of the outcome of the case, it is important that how it unfolds instills public confidence in the fairness and legitimacy of the process. While there is not a legal basis to support a finding that the district attorney has an actual conflict of interest, he found that the appearance of impropriety must nevertheless be addressed — signaling that Mr. Wade needs to leave the prosecution team in one manner or another."
NYTFEED020240125ek1p00a6p,An Unlikely New Threat to Haiti’s Stability: An Armed Environmental Group,"The country’s political crisis grew more volatile this week after an armed environmental brigade allied with a former coup leader began demanding the prime minister’s ouster.

In Haiti, as the number of murders soar and kidnappings rise, even the police are fleeing.","With no elected president in office and a prime minister widely seen as illegitimate, calls for the government’s ouster are now being heard from an unlikely source: a brigade of armed officers ostensibly responsible for protecting environmentally sensitive areas.

Armed uniformed members of the brigade clashed with government forces in northern Haiti this week, heightening tensions in an already volatile nation where gangs have seized control over large swaths of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and are wreaking havoc in rural areas.

The environmental group, the Brigade for the Security of Protected Areas (known as B-SAP), became angry after the prime minister fired its leader. On Wednesday, the group’s officers attempted to invade the local customs office, and Haitian National Police units repelled them using tear gas.

Just as worrisome to analysts is the allegiance some of the group’s leaders have publicly declared to Guy Philippe, a former police commander and coup-plotter who recently returned to Haiti after serving six years in a U.S. federal prison.

In the less than 60 days since Mr. Philippe returned home, he has been traveling the country, shoring up support for his so-called revolution.

“We’re talking about a revolution, but not a revolution in blood,” Mr. Philippe said in an interview. “We haven’t killed anyone. It’s all about peaceful demonstrations.”

Mr. Philippe was a leader of the 2004 coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Wanted for years by the United States for drug trafficking, Mr. Philippe lived freely in southern Haiti as a fugitive.

He was arrested in 2017, just before taking office as an elected senator, sentenced in U.S. federal court to nine years for money laundering and was deported to Haiti in November, which many experts saw as an astonishing move bound to inflame a troubled political landscape.

“This is a guy who has been maneuvering and plotting for 20 years to seize power in Haiti,” said James B. Foley, who was the U.S. ambassador there during the 2004 coup. “We indicted him, extradited him and sidelined him, and now we have sent him back into a Haiti that is in total anarchy, and the result is obvious and predictable and horrible.”

Mr. Philippe, who has been living in his home base, Pestel, Haiti, since his return, said he planned to go to Port-au-Prince in the coming days to stage protests, and expected that the vast majority of the population would support him in demanding the resignation of the prime minister, Ariel Henry.

Because many Haitians are disappointed in the National Police’s inability to tackle the gangs, Mr. Philippe may be right, analysts said.

“If it was a coup, it would be a legitimate coup, but we’re not making any coup,” Mr. Philippe said. “We’re not here to seize power with force.”

In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Henry said he was alarmed by the inappropriate actions of many members of B-SAP, which he noted had no legal or administrative framework. News coverage of the rogue officers risked creating confusion about the environmental surveillance group’s legitimate work, he said. On Tuesday, he added, the government created a commission to review the agency’s work.

As for Mr. Philippe, the prime minister’s office said, “Ariel Henry is responsible for applying the law.”

The United States has strongly pushed for a planned security mission to Haiti led by Kenya, which some analysts view as a tacit endorsement of Mr. Henry’s leadership.

Mr. Philippe said he “has friends” in the environmental group in the north, an alliance that could prove dangerous. Haiti, once home to a secret police force known as the tonton macoutes, has a long history of paramilitary forces that commit atrocities.

Mr. Philippe said he considered the head of the environmental brigade “an ally” with the same aim of getting the prime minister to step down.

According to a local newspaper, Mr. Philippe and the brigade are coordinating efforts aimed at opposing the current government.

“B-SAP is not the armed wing of the opposition,” said Jeantel Joseph, who was fired this week as the head of the agency, and led the group’s protests this week.

Mr. Joseph said he and Mr. Philippe belong to a larger consortium of political parties, trade unions and grass roots organizations committed to ending Mr. Henry’s time in office — peacefully, he added. With their two movements — Mr. Joseph in the north and Mr. Philippe in the south – the prime minister will have to back down, he said.

The environmental brigade he led, he said, is not a threat and simply provided security for demonstrations.

“There was never any question of taking power by force of arms,” Mr. Joseph said.

Haiti’s condition could not be more dire. Out of a force of about 15,000 officers, nearly 3,000 police officers have abandoned their posts in the past two years, according to police figures.

The United Nations reported this week that more than 4,700 people were killed in Haiti last year — more than double the number in 2022 — and nearly 2,500 were kidnapped. A group of local nuns was held for nearly a week, before being released on Wednesday.

More than 150,000 people fled last year to the United States.

Security worsened after the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. It has not been safe enough to hold elections, and the appointed prime minister, Mr. Henry, has called for international intervention.

Last fall, the United Nations approved a multinational security mission to be led by Kenya, but it has been delayed by domestic court rulings. Kenya has pledged at least 1,000 security personnel, and several other nations are expected to offer resources.

The deployment has been delayed by objections over whether the Kenyan government followed proper protocols to authorize the mission. A court decision is expected on Friday.

Mr. Philippe has publicly denounced the Kenya mission, saying it would support Mr. Henry’s administration and support “imperialism.” Mr. Philippe released a video calling the Kenyans “African brothers” but warning that if they accepted the deployment, they would be viewed as “enemies.”

The B-SAP group is supposed to work to protect environmentally sensitive areas, but it often operates independently and far from such regions, a recent United Nations report said, calling into question the scope of the group’s mission.

It was started in 2018 under Mr. Moïse with 100 people, though Mr. Henry’s government seems to have little control over its actions or a sense of how many members it has.

On Tuesday, Mr. Henry fired the man in charge of the agency that runs B-SAP, which angered the group’s members. Videos shared on social media showed hundreds of them chanting in the streets of Ouanaminthe, in northeast Haiti, demanding the return of their boss and the ouster of Mr. Henry.

In the Northeast, near the border with the Dominican Republic, B-SAP agents fired into the air and ordered citizens to return home.

B-SAP has been accused of participating in crimes, said Gédéon Jean, the head of the Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights, a Haitian organization that suspended operations in November because of rising levels of violence.

The risk is even more serious if the group allies itself with local gangs, he said.

“What you have is a very disruptive figure in this region,” Robert Muggah, who led a study on Haiti’s criminal syndicates for the United Nations, said, referring to Mr. Philippe.

It’s unclear whether Mr. Philippe plans to run for office — or to try to lead a revolt, seizing control by mobilizing former military personnel and current and former police officers who support him, Mr. Muggah said.

“I think everybody expects that he has presidential ambitions, but the path to the presidency for him is not yet clear,” he said.

Mr. Philippe is operating in a power vacuum where no one has stood up to the prime minister because they are powerless or profiting from the dysfunction, said Nicole Phillips, a California lawyer who is a close follower of Haitian politics and human rights.

“Philippe,” she said, “is all about power.”

Mr. Philippe insisted that he would “let the people decide” who should assume Haiti’s presidency. He blamed the United States for backing Mr. Henry and said the goal was to end gangs, hunger and poverty.

“We’re fighting for a better Haiti,” he said. “We’re tired. Everyone is tired.”

NYTFEED020240304ek340083p,Lawyers Offer New Witness in Effort to Disqualify Trump Prosecutors in Georgia,"The potential witness, an assistant district attorney outside Atlanta, suggested in a statement that the judge had heard misleading testimony about the prosecutors’ romance.

Defense lawyers in the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald J. Trump say they want to put someone on the stand whose testimony could back up their assertion that Terrence Bradley, a witness in their effort to disqualify the prosecutors running the case, gave misleading testimony.","The new information comes from Cindi Lee Yeager, a deputy district attorney in neighboring Cobb County, Ga., whom the defense lawyers said they spoke to on Friday about conversations she has had with Mr. Bradley.

At issue is a key matter in the disqualification effort: the timing of the romantic relationship that developed between Fani T. Willis, who as the Fulton County district attorney is leading the prosecution of Mr. Trump, and Nathan Wade, the Atlanta-area lawyer she hired to manage the case.

Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade have said that a romance developed between them after she hired him in November 2021. But the defense lawyers have tried to prove the romantic relationship started earlier.

If they are correct that Ms. Willis hired a boyfriend for a lucrative, high-profile job, it might bolster their argument that she engaged in “self-dealing” when she took a number of vacations with Mr. Wade, and thus created a conflict of interest that should result in her removal from the case.

Defense lawyers thought that Mr. Bradley, a former law partner of Mr. Wade who also served for a time as Mr. Wade’s divorce lawyer, might offer some clarity as to when the romance began. But that did not happen. In a text exchange in January, he told one of the defense lawyers in the case that he “absolutely” thought the romance began before Ms. Willis hired Mr. Wade.

But when called to the stand last week, Mr. Bradley said that he had been “speculating.”

In a filing on Monday, lawyers for David J. Shafer, a co-defendant in the case, said that they had spoken to Ms. Yeager, who said that Mr. Bradley had told her the prosecutors’ relationship began before Mr. Wade went to work for Ms. Willis.

The filing stated that according to Ms. Yeager, Mr. Bradley told her that “Mr. Wade had definitively begun a romantic relationship with Ms. Willis during the time that Ms. Willis was running for district attorney in 2019 through 2020.”

According to the filing, Ms. Yeager said she also overheard Ms. Willis call Mr. Bradley last September, prompted by a news article that mentioned how much her office was paying Mr. Wade and his law partners. (Mr. Bradley’s work for the office was not related to the Trump case.)

“They are coming after us,” Ms. Willis told Mr. Bradley during the call, according to the account offered by Ms. Yeager that is described in the defense filing. “You don’t need to talk to them about anything about us.”

The context of Ms. Willis’ alleged call to Mr. Bradley is not clear; In any case, it would have taken place before the disqualification effort began in January and before it was known that Mr. Bradley would be subpoenaed to testify.

On the stand last month, Mr. Bradley testified that he “did not personally know” Ms. Willis. “My interaction with Ms. Willis was never where I would pick up the phone and talk to her,” he said.

Also unclear is what impact, if any, Ms. Yeager’s statement could have on a judge’s decision whether to disqualify the prosecutors. The judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, has already wrapped up testimony on the disqualification question; on Friday, he said he would rule on the matter within two weeks.

In their filing on Monday, Mr. Shafer’s lawyers asked the judge to allow them to put Ms. Yeager on the stand “in the event that the court reopens the hearing to receive additional evidence.” They noted that Mr. Trump and Ms. Willis’s office have also asked the judge to allow for additional testimony.

At a hearing on Friday, Judge McAfee heard final legal arguments from both sides but said that he could hold another hearing if evidence emerged to require it.

A lawyer for Mr. Bradley did not return calls seeking comment. Ms. Yeager, who has run for local office previously as a Republican — but says she currently considers herself a Democrat — declined to comment on the filing on Monday. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office did not comment on Monday, but Ms. Willis and her office have described the disqualification effort as legally baseless and an effort to generate salacious headlines.

If successful, the effort to remove Ms. Willis would throw the criminal case against Mr. Trump into turmoil, forcing a state agency to find another prosecutor to take it on. A new prosecutor could move to keep, modify or drop the case against Mr. Trump, who was indicted in August with 18 allies on charges of conspiring to overturn the former president’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.

Since then, four defendants have pleaded guilty."
NYTFEED020240316ek3g0025t,"In Paris, the Olympics Clean Up Their Act","How do you produce a global sporting event, with millions of people swooping down on one city, in the age of global warming?

That is the test for the Paris Olympics this summer.","The organizers say they’re putting the games on a climate diet. These Olympics, they say, will generate no more than half the greenhouse gas emissions of recent Olympics. That means tightening the belt on everything that produces planet-warming emissions: electricity, food, buildings, and transportation, including the jet fuel that athletes and fans burn traveling the world to get there.

An event that attracts 10,500 athletes and an estimated 15 million spectators is, by definition, going to have an environmental toll. And that has led those who love the games but hate the pollution to suggest that the Olympics should be scattered around the world, in existing facilities, to eliminate the need for so much new construction and air travel. That’s why Paris is being watched so closely.

It is making more space for bikes and less for cars. It’s doing away with huge, diesel-powered generators, a fixture of big sporting events. It’s planning guest menus that are less polluting to grow and cook than typical French fare: more plants, less steak au poivre. Solar panels will float, temporarily, on the Seine.

But the organizers’ most significant act may be what they are not doing: They aren’t building. At least, not as much.

Instead of building new showpieces for the games (which generates lots of greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing of concrete and steel), the Paris Olympics are repurposing many of the city’s existing attractions, including the Grand Palais, the plaza known as the Concorde and even a swimming pool built for the 1924 Paris Olympics.

It’s not without controversy.

One notable emissions-reduction effort, a decision to forego conventional air-conditioning at the athletes’ village, has raised concerns. Instead, the buildings will rely on a cooling system that uses water pulled from underground. Several Olympic teams, are considering bringing their own air-conditioners.

Still the hope is that experiments like these will offer a template for other Olympics in the future, and other cities worldwide. The few new buildings that are being built, including the athletes’ housing, as well as a swimming complex and an arena, are using less cement and more wood. They have solar panels and greenery on their roofs.

The new buildings are also meant to have a life far beyond the Olympics. They’re designed to be used by local residents for decades to come and, the leaders of the Paris 2024 organizing committee say, revitalize the city’s suburbs. “We set for ourselves ambitions that have never been set for any event before, let alone have this scale,” said Georgina Grenon, who is in charge of the games’ environmental efforts.

Critics counter that, while much of what Paris is doing is commendable, particularly the limits on new construction, to truly address the climate crisis requires more than paring back emissions here and there. “We need to fundamentally rethink these huge mega events,” said Cesar Dugast, co-founder of a climate analysis group called Eclaircies. “Instead of concentrating all the events in a single city, it could be envisaged to distribute them around the world.”

‘It’s a big test’

There’s a more immediate risk facing the Olympics: climate change itself. Rising global temperatures are making Paris summers dangerously hot. That has heightened concerns about how to protect athletes and fans in late July and August.

City officials say they have planted thousands of trees in recent years to temper summer heat. They are erecting misting towers to spray the air. The search is on for wide umbrellas under which fans can wait. “We have solutions. We are preparing,” said Dan Lert, the deputy mayor in charge of preparing the city for heat. “It’s a big test.”

One major thing that sets the Paris games apart from previous Olympics is that it has imposed a limit on the total emissions it will produce. The target: Generate no more than half the greenhouse gas emissions of the 2012 Olympics, which were held in London.

London was chosen as a benchmark because the organizers there also sought to reduce emissions, and they measured them. Estimates like these are based on standard measures of, for instance, how much carbon dioxide is produced by the amount of cement used in new buildings.

The Paris organizers say they will offset those emissions by purchasing “carbon credits” to help fund emissions-reducing projects worldwide. The games organizers have not said what projects the games will fund and at what price. In any case, the market for carbon credits can be murky, with some projects not delivering on their promise.

Refashioning a historic city

What Paris is doing shows what can be done to remake an old city for a new global climate. It also shows what the limits are.

The Place de la Concorde, an 18th century plaza where guillotines were once erected during the French Revolution, this summer will be home to Olympic events like skateboarding.

The plaza is also now home to an unassuming metal box designed to spur an electricity revolution. It contains a high-powered electrical outlet connected to the national grid, enabling every big event on the plaza to throw off the shackles of diesel.

Diesel generators are the dirty secret of sports events. Typically they are trucked in to provide a stable source of power.

The Paris games have also cut a special deal with the electric utility stipulating that there be enough wind and solar energy in the grid to produce all the energy that the games consume.

When it comes to emissions, transportation is another headache. Paris has already been limiting space for cars and making space for bikes, and it’s using the games to accelerate that shift.

But the Olympics, with its huge crowds, threatens trouble for how Parisians get around their city, with many making plans to flee on vacation.

Pierre Rabadan, a former pro rugby player who is now Paris’ deputy mayor for sports, lifted his shoulders against a wind and walked briskly out of the tram stop in front of the city’s new basketball arena, at the top of Rue de la Chapelle. He pointed to an almost finished bike lane along the road, carved out of what had been a wide boulevard devoted to automobiles.

Since the election of Anne Hidalgo as mayor in 2014, Paris has added some 600 kilometers of bike lanes. Around 10 percent have been dubbed Olympistes, a play on “piste,” the French word for track.

“The problem is we built the city around cars,” Mr. Rabadan said.

Another problem is that the city’s metro system is bursting at the seams. Trains are already crowded, and workers are rushing to complete new extensions of two lines in time to serve the games.

To make room for Olympics visitors, the city has urged people to stay off the trains or work from home.

Tarzan and the old pool

Key to the organizers’ climate strategy is to build as little as possible, which is why it is tapping into a leftover from the 1924 Paris Olympics: the Georges Vallerey swimming pool.

It’s getting a new air filtration system, as well as a new roof that lets in light but keeps out heat and cold. Old wood roof beams have been repurposed as countertops. The wooden bleachers, installed at least 40 years ago, remain. Sturdy stucco walls reveal the pool’s age.

“We need not trash everything or destroy everything and put it in the bin,” said Mr. Rabadan.

The pool holds history. It is where Johnny Weissmuller, an American swimmer, won a gold medal in 1924. He went on to play Tarzan in a string of Hollywood movies, Mr. Rabadan is keen to point out.

Roughly 95 percent of the venues to be used in the 2024 games are old buildings or temporary structures. For example, several temporary pools will be built for the games, then taken apart and re-installed in communities that have a dearth of public pools.

‘A laboratory’

The Olympics, Ms. Grenon said, offer “a laboratory,” particularly when it comes to the buildings designed from scratch.

A new aquatic center, on the edge of a highway in the northern suburb of Saint-Denis, is a showpiece of Douglas fir and pine. Its 5,000 square meter roof curves like a wave: The architects designed it that way to shrink the size of the building, reducing the energy needed to heat the space.

The pool is 5 meters deep only where necessary to have greater depth for diving, and shallower where it’s not. That too saves water and energy it takes to heat the water. Some of that heat will come from a nearby data center. The venue’s 5,000 seats are made from recycled plastic.

The goal, said Cécilia Gross, one of the architects, was “to do better with less.”

Rising nearby is the biggest new Olympics project: the 128-acre Athletes Village complex that is to morph into a mixed neighborhood for 6,000 residents afterward. Its builders say its emissions are at least 30 percent less than a conventional project of its size.

Timber has a starring role here, too. The village is a cluster of mostly wood-frame buildings.

While timber has its own environmental costs depending on how it’s grown, it is considered far more sustainable than concrete.

In the village, a small patch of sidewalk is paved with oyster shells that can be watered from an underground reservoir and cool the sidewalk on hot days. One experimental building is to recycle all its water. To cool the grounds, 9,000 trees have been planted, including local varieties like oaks and elms that can survive in a hotter future.

Then there’s the unconventional air conditioning.

A network of pipes, using water cooled by first being sent underground, will cool the interiors of the buildings in a technology known as a geo-exchange system. In New York City, St. Patrick’s Cathedral uses something similar, but using air instead of water. A smattering of U.S. universities are also switching to geoexchange.

Along with shade trees, insulation and a breeze from the river, the builders say indoor temperatures can be kept cool enough for the Paris summers of the future. However, the games organizers say, Olympic teams are still free to bring their own air conditioners.

The United States, Canada and Norway said they would. Australia and Ireland have too, according to press reports. The mayor, Ms. Hidalgo, in an interview with Reuters, urged teams to “trust the science.”

Mr. Trump will hold a rally in Rome, a city of about 38,000 people in the state’s deeply conservative northwest. Mr. Biden will hold a campaign event in Atlanta, just a few miles from the Fulton County Jail, where Mr. Trump was booked last August on racketeering charges in the state’s election interference case against him and his allies.","Vice President Kamala Harris will also campaign on Saturday in Nevada, a battleground state that she and Mr. Biden won in 2020.

Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump in Georgia in 2020 by just 11,779 votes. In Mr. Trump’s vast effort to deny Mr. Biden his electoral victory, he devoted particular attention to the state. In January 2021, he pressured Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” the 11,780 votes that would allow him to overcome Mr. Biden’s margin of victory.

Now Mr. Trump will rally in the state while under indictment. It has been more than six months since the former president was booked in Fulton County, where he was fingerprinted and had his mug shot taken in a whirlwind media spectacle.

Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, who is prosecuting the case against Mr. Trump in Georgia, has said that a trial will probably “not conclude until the winter or the very early part of 2025,” which means that the case could very likely hang over the campaign in Georgia through Election Day in November.

The president and his predecessor are each likely to highlight the case in their campaign events on Saturday. Mr. Biden may seek to continue to sharpen the contrasts between himself and Mr. Trump, casting his opponent as a threat to American democracy and pointing to the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election as just one of many things that make Mr. Trump unfit for office.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has made the 91 felony counts he is facing across four different cases, including the one in Georgia, a central part of his campaign message, portraying — without evidence — his many legal troubles as a plot by the Biden administration to interfere with the 2024 election."
NYTFEED020240320ek3k0038p,Extreme Heat Wave Pushes South Sudan to Close Schools,"Climate change already worsened floods and droughts in the young nation. Now, soaring temperatures are forecast for two weeks.

South Sudan has long been hit by climate change-exacerbated disasters like recurring droughts and floods. Now, extreme heat is forcing the world’s youngest nation to close its schools.","The authorities have ordered schools across the country shuttered since Monday because of a wave of excessive heat that is expected to last at least two weeks. Temperatures are forecast to reach 113 degrees Fahrenheit, far above the 90-degree highs typically experienced in the dry season from December to March.

Officials did not say how long the schools would remain closed. But the health and education ministries said in a joint statement that “any school that will be found opened during this time will have its registration withdrawn.”

Parents have also been urged to stop their children from playing outside and to monitor them for signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.

The sweltering temperatures in South Sudan, whose tropical climate includes both dry and wet seasons, are interrupting the onset of the academic year. Most schools in the East African nation, especially those outside Juba, the capital, are congested and underfunded and lack infrastructure such as air-conditioners to help withstand such heat.

South Sudan is highly exposed to severe climatic events, including droughts, floods and rising temperatures. These changes have exacerbated displacement, food insecurity and communal conflict in the nation of 11 million people, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011.

The heat wave is also expected to put pressure on the country’s nascent health care system, which has long grappled with limited financing and worker shortages.

South Sudan is not the only African country where extreme weather events have precipitated school shutdowns. In 2022, Malawi’s government shortened the school day in the southern Shire Valley because of rising temperatures. And in Uganda, severe floods have repeatedly forced the government to close schools over the years.

Yet in South Sudan, conflict, a worsening humanitarian crisis and a tense political environment have made it even harder to mitigate the turmoil of climate change.

South Sudan’s civil war has claimed the lives of some 400,000 people and displaced millions more since 2013. And although a tenuous political agreement has held between the country’s feuding leaders over the past few years, a growing humanitarian crisis and deadly rifts among forces within the ruling alliance have added to the uncertainty over whether repeatedly postponed elections will take place this year.

At the same time, the war in neighboring Sudan has forced the return of nearly half a million South Sudanese who had fled the conflict in their own country. Many have come back to towns and villages where their homes and farms have been pillaged and are finding it hard to rebuild their lives.

Emmanuel Lokosang, the head teacher at Jada Jedid Nursery and Primary School in the capital, said he hoped the weather would cool down soon so that students could resume classes.

“Juba is really hot,” Mr. Lokosang, whose school has over 600 students, said in a telephone interview Wednesday morning.

He added: “We hope they don’t delay for long, because the more we delay, the more it affects the academic calendar and how we can recover the curriculum.”"

Two women argued about President Vladimir V. Putin outside the Russian Embassy in the Latvian capital on Sunday, waiting to cast their votes in a rubber-stamp election as a military helicopter hovered overhead.","One, an older Russian woman who has lived in Latvia for 50 years, came to cast her vote for Mr. Putin in Russia’s presidential election. The other, a woman in her fifties, came to show support for the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, who before his death in an Arctic prison last month urged supporters to show up at polling stations in protest.

“I think what happened to Navalny was murder,” said Alla, the younger woman, who would give only her first name.

“He deserved it,” retorted the older woman, who declined to provide her name.

Such tensions show Riga, the quaint capital of Latvia, as a microcosm of the complex dynamics of Russian politics and Russian speakers’ place in the world. Latvia — which was once annexed by the Soviet Union — has long distrusted its own, partly pro-Putin Russian minority. But it also has treated with suspicion the antiwar Russians who flocked over the border after the invasion of Ukraine.

About a third of Latvia’s 1.8 million residents are estimated to be ethnic Russians, most of whose ancestors came to the country after the Soviet occupation. Some of them have supported Mr. Putin’s nationalism out of nostalgia, or as a response to the perceived discrimination faced by Russian speakers in Latvia, where many were born. Many people in Latvia view the Russian-speaking minority as a fifth column for the Kremlin.

Mr. Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, however, has brought a new wave of thousands of Russians migrating west into Latvia. These have tended to be younger, more educated and more critical of Mr. Putin than the older diaspora.

But the Latvian government — which views the Kremlin with hostility — has been wary of fully welcoming the Russian exiles.

Those dynamics were on display Sunday outside the Russian Embassy, where protest posters depicting Mr. Putin as a warmonger surrounded the stately mansion.

“We must show that a great number of Russians don’t support Putin, and don’t support the war,” a former regional campaigner for Mr. Navalny, Sergei Bespalov, told supporters across the street from the embassy.

The Russian electoral commission said 11,000 people voted in Riga in 2018 during Russia’s last presidential vote. Fearing unrest this time, the Latvian police cordoned off the embassy and the border guard service deployed a helicopter above it.

Migration officers also checked the documents of people who came to vote, ostensibly to see their residence status. These checks come amid a wider, politically charged campaign to deport Russian citizens who fail a Latvian language test, regardless how long they have lived in the country.

The Russian Embassy called the document checks intimidation aimed at suppressing voter turnout, which was significantly lower than in the previous election.

Earlier in the voting line, the older pro-Putin voter was expounding about the hardships facing Russians in Latvia as younger, opposition-leaning voters around her rolled their eyes.

The verdict from the presidential primaries is already in, but the best data on what they mean for the general election is only now beginning to arrive.","That data is vote history: a person-by-person record of who voted and who did not. It offers a definitive account of the makeup of the electorate, and it will help answer some of the most important questions of the primary season, from whether the Nikki Haley voters already back President Biden to whether the primary results suggest Mr. Biden is better positioned than the polls suggest.

Last week, we got the first big tranche of vote history data from a place where we’ve done a recent state poll: Georgia.

At least here, it suggests that most Haley voters already supported Mr. Biden in 2020. It also implies that Mr. Biden’s strength in the primaries is not inconsistent with polls showing him struggling among young and Black voters.

The Haley vote in Georgia

In the Republican primary in Georgia, Ms. Haley received 13.2 percent of the vote. That may not have been anywhere near enough to win, but it could easily be enough to be a big headache for Donald J. Trump if those are Republicans who have soured on the former president.

The vote history data offers a few clues suggesting that Mr. Trump doesn’t have much to worry about here — or at least nothing new to worry about. Most of these voters already backed Mr. Biden in the 2020 election and continue to back him in 2024.

There are two pieces of evidence to support this idea.

The first comes from the vote history data from previous partisan primaries in Georgia. That data shows that about 10 percent of voters in this month’s Republican primary had voted in a Democratic primary in the last eight years — a good indication that they may have been Democrats voting in a Republican contest. These voters probably backed Ms. Haley by a wide margin.

A second comes from our October Times/Siena survey of Georgia, which we matched to the new vote history records. Respondents who voted in the recent Republican presidential primary said they had voted for Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden by a margin of 82 percent to 12 percent in 2020, a tally similar to what these voters say they’ll do in November. Both tallies mirror Mr. Trump’s 85-13 victory in the Georgia primary.

The similarity between the Republican primary results and the poll responses of Republican primary voters suggest that most of Mr. Trump’s weakness in the primary simply came from those already inclined to back Mr. Biden in 2020 and 2024.

Among solid Republicans, Mr. Trump remains on stronger footing. He held a 94-2 polling lead over Mr. Biden among Republican primary voters who identified as Republicans in the Times/Siena survey. Similarly, he had a 91-3 lead among Republican primary voters who had not voted in a recent Democratic primary.

What about Biden?

The Democratic primary has not been competitive this year, and Georgia was no exception. Overall, President Biden won 95 percent of the vote in Georgia, one of his best tallies anywhere in the country.

Not surprisingly, the Times/Siena poll last fall found no evidence of serious dissent among these voters: Mr. Biden had a 96-0 lead over Mr. Trump among Times/Siena respondents who went on to vote in the Democratic primary, four months later.

What’s interesting is that the Times/Siena poll found plenty of evidence of Democratic dissent among the broader group of registered voters. In the head-to-head polling matchup in Georgia in October, Mr. Trump led Mr. Biden by six points, including finding Mr. Biden at just 76-19 among Black voters overall. (In 2020, he won around 90 percent of the Black vote in Georgia.)

So why did Mr. Biden win a decisive victory when the polls showed him faring relatively poorly? The vote history data suggests the answer is simple: Those who voted in the Democratic primary and the broader group of registered voters are very different, with very different views of Mr. Biden.

Overall, just 4 percent of registered voters turned out in the Democratic primary. Nearly half were 65 and over; just 5 percent were under 30. It turns out that this old and highly engaged group of Democrats is very loyal to Mr. Biden.

This is particularly clear seeing Biden’s support among Black voters, who account for over one-fourth of the electorate in Georgia.

Remarkably, none of the Black voters who flirted with Mr. Trump in the October poll — those who said they would choose him in November 2024 — ended up voting in a primary, whether in the Republican primary or as Democratic dissenters. Mr. Biden led, 96-0, in the Times/Siena poll among self-identified Black voters who turned out in the March 12 primary, versus 74-21 among all other Black voters. Despite Mr. Trump’s support in the poll, only about 5 percent of Black primary voters decided to cast a ballot in the Republican primary, according to state voter records.

This is not the first time we’ve seen a big difference between primary voters and the rest of the electorate. In Times/Siena data, Mr. Biden is struggling badly among irregular young and nonwhite voters, helping to give Mr. Trump a narrow lead among registered voters nationwide. At the same time, Mr. Trump fares poorly among highly engaged voters, like those who vote in special elections.

Mr. Biden has major weaknesses in the polling, but his problems aren’t being put to the test in low-turnout primaries. The general election is when the irregular voters tend to show up, if they show up at all."
NYTFEED020240312ek3c002s1,"Citizenship Law That Excludes Muslims Takes Effect, India Says","The law sparked lethal riots when it was passed. Now, after a four-year delay, it has come into force on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election campaign.

Weeks before a national election, the Indian government has abruptly announced that it will begin enforcing a citizenship law that had remained dormant since late 2019 after inciting deadly riots by opponents who called it anti-Muslim.","The incendiary law grants Indian citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsees and Christians from a few nearby countries. Muslims are pointedly excluded.

With a characteristic thunderclap, the government of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, made a short declaration on Monday night that it had finalized the details that would bring the law, known as the Citizenship Amendment Act, into force.

The government’s action, coming just before India announces the dates for an election expected in April and May, shows Mr. Modi delivering on a promise, and could change the electoral math in districts with Hindu refugees who stand to benefit from the law.

Politics aside, the law is not expected to significantly change the demography of India’s diverse population of 1.4 billion, at least not on its own. But it makes plain the power that Mr. Modi wields to redefine the Indian republic, steamrolling any resistance to his vision of a Hindu-first state.

The law spent more than four years in hibernation after protests by hundreds of thousands of Muslims and other Indians who were outraged by the idea that citizenship would be defined with reference to religious identity.

In February 2020, while President Donald J. Trump was on a state visit, riots broke out in the capital, New Delhi. Whole neighborhoods were devastated in the northeastern part of the city, where gas cylinders were turned into makeshift bombs and tossed into mosques. At least 50 people were killed, most of them Muslims.

A high-profile protest camp at a place called Shaheen Bagh, operated mainly by female protesters from different religious groups, carried on until late March before being dispersed. And then Covid-19 intervened, helping to suppress further protest.

The government justified the new rules as a humanitarian response to the plight of minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, India’s three big Muslim-majority neighbors. Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk turned political ally of Mr. Modi, wrote on social media that rescuing communities “who are suffering from religious brutality” would bring “joy to humanity.”

It is hard for many to take this explanation at face value. For one thing, the inclusion of some countries and exclusion of others looks arbitrary. For another, Muslims persecuted because of their faith, for instance the Ahmadiyya and Shiites of Pakistan, do not make the cut for Indian citizenship. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called the law “fundamentally discriminatory.”

To critics, the Citizenship Amendment Act looks like one part of a pincer movement against Muslims. It was brought to life at the same time as a national citizenship registry that would allow the government to expel undocumented residents, even if their families had lived in India for generations.

As Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, Amit Shah, said at the time, “Please understand the ‘chronology’: first the C.A.A.,” and then the registry. In other words, first non-Muslim refugees would be allowed citizenship. Then the refugees who remained would be expelled. More than 1,000 “declared foreigners” have been detained in the northeastern state of Assam.

On Monday, protests erupted there and in several other states after the government announced enforcement of the citizenship law. Shaheen Ahmed, a doctoral student in Kerala, said that he and other students came out to protest across his state.

“We were demanding the rollback of the law when police came and started beating us,” Mr. Ahmed said.

One group that rejoiced at the news is a large community of lower-caste Hindus in West Bengal, whose ancestors came to India from Bangladesh. Their support for Mr. Modi in the upcoming election could tip several parliamentary seats into the majority that he is expected to achieve anyway.

Other Hindu refugees, from Pakistan, had already been acquiring citizenship. More than 1,100 have been granted that status in Mr. Modi’s home state, Gujarat, since 2016. The point of the Citizenship Amendment Act will be to make these naturalizations possible on a national level, and more visible."

Putin’s vision of Russia — successful, innovative and borderless — is on display at one of Moscow’s biggest tourist attractions, a Stalin-era exhibition center that houses a sleek showcase called Russia 2024. The exhibition promotes what the Kremlin portrays as Russia’s achievements in the past two decades, roughly the period Mr. Putin has been in power, and his promises for the future after he secures another six-year term in rubber-stamp elections this weekend.

The exhibition is in many ways a microcosm of a country whose people largely — at least in public — avert their gaze from the big and bloody war in Ukraine that Mr. Putin started more than two years ago.","The centerpiece is a grand hall housing pavilions featuring all the Russian regions, including five illegally annexed from Ukraine. Visitors to one pavilion are greeted by two LED screens displaying tulip fields that portray the region of Belgorod, which borders Ukraine, as calm and peaceful.

That is increasingly at odds with the reality of regular air raid sirens and deadly Ukrainian missile and drone strikes on the city, including one on Thursday that killed two people and injured 19.

At the Crimea pavilion, throngs of visitors pose with men dressed as Roman legionnaires next to a video boasting about the bridge connecting the peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to the Russian mainland. There is no mention of the Ukrainian attack in 2022 that blew a hole in the bridge, or the frequent threats that lead to the closing of the bridge for hours at a time.

It is a cognitive dissonance many Russians have adopted, celebrating the motherland and accepting the government’s triumphal narrative — even as Mr. Putin has become a pariah in much of the Western world, domestic prices rise and the Russian army suffers a staggering number of casualties in Ukraine."

NYTFEED020240316ek3g000p1,Was He Secretly Working for China? This Is What He Told Us.,"Di Sanh Duong openly said that some people might mistake him for a Chinese spy, but he maintained that he never did anything to hurt Australia.

Not long after we first met, the man said that if Australia was looking for Chinese spies, he was just the type of person they would be looking at — but the authorities would never “dare say I’m Chinese intelligence.”","Given the anti-China fervor in Australia, he acknowledged he could come off as suspicious. So why would he not get into trouble with the authorities? He believed that it would be embarrassing for Australia to accuse of him of spying because he had been an active member of a major political party.

His confidence was absolute, and utterly misplaced. Less than two years later, in 2020, he became the first person to be charged under Australia’s broad foreign interference laws. He was accused of acting on behalf of Beijing.

Who was the suspect?

Di Sanh “Sunny” Duong, 68, was born and raised in Vietnam. He was among the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Chinese who fled that country in the 1970s. He settled in Australia and grew a business making tombstones, secured a middle-class life and got enmeshed in local Chinese community groups.

I first interviewed him in 2019 and quickly realized that Mr. Duong was prone to boasting — about his travels, about his family and about his status in society, so much so that it was difficult to take him seriously.

What did he do?

The case against Mr. Duong was not about what he did, but what he was planning to do. Mr. Duong had ties with the Chinese Communist Party, prosecutors said. He had invited an Australian government minister to a charity event, they added, with the intention of someday trying to influence him on behalf of Beijing.

During the trial, the jury was presented with two versions of Mr. Duong: Was he a savvy operator pushing China’s agenda in Australia, as the prosecution would have it, or was he, as the defense claimed, a bombastic braggart?

What was the verdict?

Mr. Duong did not testify in court. But while the trial was underway, he met me, at a pub a stone’s throw from the courthouse, to share his story.

He gave outlandish and convoluted reasons for the actions that prosecutors built their case around. One head-spinning episode involved how Mr. Duong thought he was interacting with a Chinese intelligence officer but later concluded, thanks to a TV show, that the official was not a spy. One thing was clear: Mr. Duong remained adamant that he never did anything against Australian interests.

The jury disagreed. In December, he was found guilty of preparing for or planning an act of foreign interference. Late last month, a judge sentenced him to two years and nine months in prison. Mr. Duong is expected to serve a year behind bars."

Folding Screens Inspired by Pompeii and Elsa Schiaparelli","“They’re movable pieces of art,” says Budapest-born, London-based decorator Gergei Erdei of his new collection of hand-painted folding pinewood screens. Part of his Objects of Desires series, the six designs include trompe l’oeil columns, wing-footed mythological figures and interlinked geometric shapes. Erdei found inspiration for his pieces, which are over seven feet tall, in a recent retrospective of the Italian couturier Elsa Schiaparelli’s works at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs and in the lacquered screens of multimedia Art Deco creator Jean Dunand; Pompeii’s crumbling frescoes and ancient mosaics informed the mythological design’s soft, ocher hues, which were achieved through multiple coats of acrylic paint. “I keep coming back to Pompeii in my work,” Erdei says. “I find the layers faded by time so beautiful, like veils of history.”

Thought to have originated during China’s Han dynasty, screens became popular decorative pieces in Europe in the 17th century, when they were used for privacy and to divide rooms and block drafts. A couple of centuries later, Coco Chanel lined her Paris apartment with black-and-gold lacquer Coromandel screens. Erdei, who once worked as a women’s wear designer at Gucci in Rome, also wants his screens to stand out. “I see them used as a theatrical background behind a bed or a sofa, or either side of a fireplace,” he says. A bespoke screen will also make an appearance, alongside his signature acrylic murals, in his next project, the interior design of a private riad turned hotel called Le M, opening in Marrakech’s medina this summer.

The Chef Calum Franklin Brings His Savory Pies to Paris

English fare has rarely gotten its due in France, but the British chef Calum Franklin, nicknamed the “Pie King” from his years making artistically latticed savory pies at London’s Holborn Dining Room, is intent on changing that this month with the opening of Public House, his first project in Paris. Occupying what was previously an American bar-nightclub in the Opera district, the restaurant combines the brasserie format — broad and bustling dining rooms with deep booths — and the relaxed spirit of a British pub. Franklin wanted the menu to be an approachable mix featuring a selection of his signature pies (among them beef and bone marrow; Montgomery Cheddar, dauphinoise potato and caramelized onion; chicken and wild mushroom; and lobster for two) alongside pub classics like Scotch eggs, sausage rolls and sticky toffee pudding. “If we’re introducing Parisians to old-school British pies that are inspired by 600-year-old recipes and history, we have to do it gradually,” says Franklin. For the interiors, the architect and designer Laura Gonzalez wove in hand-finished oak furnishings, tartan fabrics that vary on each of the three floors and a patchwork of bright tiles. On the lower level, there’s a bar with its own entrance, while on the top floor, diners can sit in a spacious winter garden and play a round of darts or chess in the game room. It all makes for something fresh for Paris and an adventure for Franklin. “When I was young, a lot of my chef friends came to work in Paris but I was too shy; I didn’t speak French and it was all too easy to stay in London,” he says. “I’ve always regretted it because I saw how Paris changed them. Now, it’s my turn.” Public House opens March 26, publichouseparis.fr.

A Cookbook — and Seder Plates — to Celebrate Passover

Passover, the Jewish holiday that marks the Exodus from Egypt, is built around a meal — the Seder — and the story of the flight to the Promised Land that’s told with it. On the same night, everywhere in the world where there are Jews, the ritual meal takes place, though the food and flavors differ according to the local culture. “The Jewish Holiday Table,” a new collection of recipes curated by the Jewish Food Society, covers all the Jewish holidays and Shabbat, the Friday night Sabbath dinner. The recipes — and family histories — come from cooks with roots in Iran, India, Iraq and Israel, Morocco, Hungary, Denmark and the former Soviet Union. Many of the contributors’ families settled in New York, among them the Ethiopian-born chef Beejhy Barhany, who owns Harlem’s Tsion Café and contributed Shabbat dishes from her family village in Tigray. These include dabo, an Ethiopian honey bread, and messer wot, a red lentil stew. Fany Gerson, whose family migrated from Ukraine to Mexico City, where she was born, and who now makes doughnuts at her bakery Fan Fan in Brooklyn, spices up her Passover Seder, adding chiles and cilantro to the matzo ball soup and spicy tomato sauce to the gefilte fish. Her brisket is cooked in tamales. Serve the food you end up making on a Seder plate from Hayom, a Brooklyn-based company that collaborates with artists on Judaica. The conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas has created a plate featuring a photograph of “Reach” (2023), his work with the artist Coby Kennedy that’s on display at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, while the ceramist Frankie Aziz has designed one with her signature cobalt drawings.

A Cafe and Art Space in a Former Berlin Amusement Park

For more than two decades, the amusement park Spreepark, located along Berlin’s River Spree, was left abandoned. Its retro rides were engulfed by grass and vines, and its owner was eventually jailed for drug smuggling. In 2014, Spreepark was bought by the city of Berlin and handed over to the state-owned park management company Grün Berlin with the remit that they enliven it with culture and food. Now, the first project within the revitalized complex is open and ready for visitors: The Eierhäuschen, a recently renovated 19th-century building just outside the amusement park, contains Ei 12437, a cafe run by the restaurateur Jessica-Joyce Sidon and the chef Alexandra Strödel that began service in February, as well as the multidisciplinary Spreepark Art Space, which opens on Friday. (Its inaugural exhibition is a group show of artists — Marcus Maeder, Sabine Scho, Sissel Tolaas and Annett Zinsmeister — who were asked to research the park and present their findings.) For lunch, the beer garden serves elevated German pub dishes such as a hearty potato salad, pretzels and pickled herring and onion sandwiches. In the evenings it gets a bit more formal, with a small but sophisticated menu served in a dining room featuring parquet floors and carmine walls. The latest seasonal dishes include an Onsen tamago-style egg served with potato foam, and cabbage stuffed with Jerusalem artichoke and hazelnuts. ei-12437.berlin.

Decadent Home Textiles From the Fashion Designer Giles Deacon

Sanderson, the British company that’s been producing wallpaper since the Victorian era, draws upon a deep well of design legacy with each new collection they release — and their latest collaboration, with the London-based fashion designer Giles Deacon, is no different. Deacon looked to Sanderson’s archive of British countryside florals and added his own flourishes to fabrics and wall coverings in a soothing palette of pastels and pale earth tones. Faraday velvet takes the humble concept of chicken wire and transforms it into a twisting pattern that would feel at home within the walls of an elegant estate. Andromeda’s Cup turns its titular subject into a wallpaper motif framed by acanthus leaves and sweeping drapery. Perhaps fittingly for a couturier, many of Deacon’s prints have a handcrafted look — the Aperignon Parade wallpaper features saw-toothed stripes that appear to have been freshly made with pinking shears, while artfully rumpled bows and Deacon’s own calligraphy add an unexpected element of whimsy to the botanical Cupid’s Beau print. The designer wanted the collection to be “surprising yet classic,” he says, “always tethered to an unwavering sense of Britishness.” From $196 per wallpaper roll and $220 per fabric yard, sanderson.sandersondesigngroup.com.

A Healthy Dose of Color Renews a Hotel on the Finnish Coast

In the early 1930s, the Finnish architects Alvar and Aino Aalto completed Paimio Sanatorium, a modernist masterpiece dedicated to the treatment of tuberculosis. At Paimio, patients could recover in rooms with mint-green ceilings, take fresh air on curved balconies and walk banana-yellow stairs leading to bright communal areas. The idea of a building that might influence human well-being resonated with Aino Brandt, a founding partner and interior architect at the Helsinki-based design firm KOKO3. Tasked with renovating Original Sokos Hotel Royal in Vaasa, a maritime city said to be Finland’s sunniest, Brandt drew on the Aaltos’ “ingenious use of bold colors,” she says. The two-story lobby of the hotel’s 1980s tower — which reopened last month and now holds a lively multi-panel commissioned work by the Finnish artist Jenni Rope — is the nexus around which the hotel’s social spaces, including a cinema, a rooftop pool area with no less than three saunas, and a trio of restaurants, are organized. Above dining tables, lamps by Muller Van Severen for Valerie Objects reference the Aaltos’ preference for functional, indirect lighting. In the hotel’s 139 bedrooms (121 more rooms will be added once the second part of the hotel opens across the street in 2026), shades of yellow, deep orange and blue feature on walls, while textile patterns designed by KOKO3 and manufactured by the Finnish weaving mill Annala make carpets and cushions pop.

Two Artists Make a Home for Their Family, and Their Collection"
NYTFEED020240322ek3m005pl,A Rock Fell From Space Into Sweden. Who Owns It on Earth?,"Sweden’s courts have been debating claims to a meteorite that fell north of Stockholm, including whether the right to move around in nature, including on private property, extends to claiming a meteorite.

The iron rock’s journey from the depths of space ended with a thud in a dense pine forest, about an hour north of Stockholm, around 10 on a November night four years ago.","Unusually, its trajectory was caught on several cameras in the region used to track meteoroids. That led to a weekslong hunt and an even longer court battle over an unusual question: Who owns an unearthly object that falls to Earth?

The legal case took another turn on Thursday, when an appeals court ruled in favor of the landowner, overturning a decision that had sided with the two men who had recovered the meteorite.

Days after the rock landed, Anders Zetterqvist, a geologist, found the site where it first hit the ground. After several weeks of searching, his friend, Andreas Forsberg, a fellow geologist, found the 30-pound chunk sticking out of the moss where it had ricocheted, about 230 feet away.

“It was the find of a lifetime for me,” he said. “It was so spectacular. And to know that it was just a couple of weeks old.”

Most meteoroids that make it to the Earth’s atmosphere burn up on entry, leaving only a trace of light, called a meteor, in the sky. The meteorite north of Stockholm, made of iron, was the 10th fresh-fall meteorite — newly landed, rather than older and buried in the ground — to have been found in Sweden, and one of only a handful of fresh-fall iron meteorites found in the world, Mr. Forsberg said.

After a few weeks, the men took the rock to the Swedish Museum of Natural History, where it has been held since 2020.

“We were afraid that hundreds of people from all over would show up to search for more,” Mr. Forsberg added. “Better and bigger pieces could leave the country before we knew it.”

Dan Holtstam, a senior researcher in the museum’s department of geosciences, said, “It’s a textbook example of an iron meteorite.”

“Falls of iron meteorites are rare globally — this is the only observed fall of an iron meteorite in Sweden,” Dr. Holtstam added. “In almost 40 years in geoscience, it was the first time I laid my hands on a newly fallen meteorite.”

In addition to their scientific value, meteorites are prized by collectors. In the global market of private collectors, one like this could garner tens of thousands of dollars, Dr. Holtstam said.

About a week after the geologists went public with their find, the owner of the estate where the meteorite had been found, Johan Benzelstierna von Engestrom, sent a letter to the museum claiming ownership.

The legal battle ensued.

Laws regulating the ownership of found meteorites vary from country to country. In Sweden, there are none. In France and Morocco, on the other hand, “the first to put his or her hands on it has ownership of it,” Dr. Holtstam said. In Denmark, they are state property.

In December 2022, the Uppsala District Court ruled in favor of the geologists, deeming the meteorite movable property. “A newly fallen meteorite is not part of the property on which it has landed,” the judge wrote in a statement.

The landowner appealed. On Thursday, the appeals court in Stockholm ruled in his favor.

Judge Robert Green, one of four judges on the case, said the appeals court’s ruling turned on two questions: whether meteorites could be considered “immovable” property and the extent of a Swedish customary law, known as “Allemansrätten,” that provides the right of public access.

Laws applying to immovable property — houses and land — are clear, the judge said.

“The point of departure regarding immovable property is that the landowner has the right to it,” he said in an interview Friday. “But we have no specific law regarding meteorites, which made this case special.”

Allemansrätten entitles everyone in Sweden to move around in nature, including to hike, bike or camp, even on private property.

“That includes some right to take berries and even small rocks from other people’s property,” Judge Green said.

The plaintiffs argued that the right to pick up small things could include amber and more valuable items. But Judge Green said in the ruling, “We have made the assessment that the closest thing to hand is to consider meteorites or space rocks as part of immovable property just like other stones, even though it may intuitively feel like a meteorite is something foreign to the earth.”

One judge dissented, arguing that while the meteorite should be regarded as immovable property, in this case, the customary law also applied, and should be interpreted to include the right to take a meteorite from private property.

“Allemansratt has far-reaching implications for everyone so it was interesting and important for us to try this,” Judge Green said.

Mr. Benzelstierna von Engestrom praised the ruling, saying in an interview, “I want to retain ownership of it but give it to a Swedish museum on permanent loan.”

He did not specify which museum, but said that he wanted it to benefit the public.

The geologists have not decided whether to appeal to Sweden’s Supreme Court.

Mr. Forsberg said they were disappointed by the appellate decision.

“It’s very sad for me and my friend,” he said. “I’ve been passionate about collecting rocks and fossils my whole life.” He added: “It’s sad for all of the enthusiasts that are interested in finding new meteorites. If people don’t think they’ll get a reward, how are we going to get people out searching?”"

The authorities were battling another round of dangerous wildfires along Chile’s Pacific Coast early Thursday morning, several weeks after blazes there killed more than 100 people.","The national disaster agency said on Wednesday night that several communities in the Valparaíso region were being evacuated. That part of the coast is dotted with towns that rise steeply from the ocean.

Fire crews were fighting three fast-moving blazes overnight that were contained but still burning, Carolina Tohá Morales, Chile’s interior minister, told reporters. She said one challenge was that the crew could not send planes to drop water at night.

While the extent of the damage was unclear, she added, the authorities estimated that it affected 15 to 40 homes.

Devastating wildfires swept through the region last month after erupting in Viña del Mar, a coastal resort city about 80 miles by road northwest of Santiago, the capital. They ravaged entire neighborhoods, trapped people fleeing in cars and destroyed thousands of homes.

President Gabriel Boric called those fires Chile’s worst disaster since a cataclysmic 2010 earthquake killed more than 400 people and displaced about 1.5 million more.

* What are the big election issues?","* How do they select the Assembly?

* When will we learn the result?

* Where can I find out more?

Why does this election matter?

South Korea​ns go to the polls on April 10 to select a new 300-member National Assembly. The parliamentary elections are widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol. They will also serve as a vote of confidence on the opposition Democratic Party, which has held majority control in the Assembly for the past four years.

Mr. Yoon won the presidential election in March 2022 by a razor-thin margin, and three months later, his People Power Party won the most big-city mayor and provincial governor races. But two major handicaps have hobbled his presidency: his party’s lack of control in the single-chamber Assembly and Mr. Yoon’s low approval ratings.

​An electoral victory by his party could add momentum to Mr. Yoon’s four major reform programs involving the country’s health care, education, labor and national pension systems, as well as his promise to abolish the nation’s ministry of gender equality. Mr. Yoon will also see it as lending political legitimacy to his policy of aligning South Korea more closely with the United States.

But if the opposition scores a decisive win, it will further weaken Mr. Yoon’s leadership and may turn him into an early lame duck, political analysts say.

What are the big election issues?

South Korea faces a host of issues with no easy solution: a slowing economy, runaway housing prices, a rapidly aging population, a widening income gap, a gender divide especially among its young generation and a growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea.

But South Korea’s worsening political polarization means that practically every sensitive issue is seen through a partisan lens. And political analysts say that it also means that this election is run not on any sustained policy debate but more on stoking and playing to voters’ fears and resentments of the other side.

Surveys in recent weeks showed that a majority of South Koreans disapproved of Mr. Yoon’s performance, which has emerged as a key election issue. He was unpopular especially among voters in their 50s and younger. But the same surveys also found respondents distrustful of the opposition Democratic Party, with its leader, Lee Jae-myung, standing trial on bribery and other criminal charges.

Mr. Yoon’s party appeals to conservative voters by arguing that its election victory would propel his campaign to drive out what he calls corrupt “anti-state” progressives from the center of South Korean politics.

The liberal opposition’s main catchphrase is to “punish” the Yoon government for everything from rising consumer prices to its veto of a parliamentary bill that would have launched an independent investigation into allegations of corruption against the first lady, Kim Keon Hee.

How do they select the Assembly?

Of the 300 parliamentary seats up for grabs, 254 are elected through voting at as many electoral districts across the country. Those races will largely be a contest between the two main parties: Mr. Yoon’s People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party. The other 46 seats, not attached to any voting districts, are distributed among smaller political parties, roughly according to the numbers of votes they win in a parallel nationwide polling.

Political parties did not finish nominating their candidates until less than a month before election day, giving voters little time to study them and the issues they stand for. But in South Korea, parliamentary elections are often decided more by the popularity of political parties and the sitting president than by the individual candidates.

When will we learn the result?

Voting begins at 6 a.m. local time, and, unless there’s an extremely tight race, it should be clear by early the next day which party has won.

NYTFEED020240310ek3a000ul,Trump Vilifies Migrants and Mocks Biden’s Stutter in Georgia Speech,"The former president also attacked Mr. Biden in harsh terms in a combative speech that signaled the beginning of the general election campaign.

Early in his remarks in Rome, Ga., at what was effectively his first campaign rally of the general election, former President Donald J. Trump on Saturday blasted President Biden’s State of the Union address as an “angry, dark, hate-filled rant” that was more divisive than unifying.","He then mocked Mr. Biden’s lifelong stutter, a jab that set the tone for the lengthy speech that followed.

Over nearly two hours, Mr. Trump lobbed sharp personal attacks at Mr. Biden’s mental and physical health and revived a litany of grievances against political opponents, prosecutors and television executives. He used inflammatory language to stoke fears about immigration, called the press “criminals” and repeated his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

Mr. Trump told thousands of his supporters gathered at the rally that “everything Joe Biden touches” turns to filth, though he used an expletive to describe the result. “Everything. I tried finding a different word, but there are some words that cannot be duplicated.” (He used the word, or a variant, at least four times in his speech.)

The speech that Mr. Trump gave on Saturday was his first since Mr. Biden repeatedly attacked him and his policies in his State of the Union address. “Joe Biden should not be shouting angrily at America,” Mr. Trump said. “America should be shouting angrily at Joe Biden.”

But his critiques moved toward personal insults. At one point, Mr. Trump slurred his words and pretended to stutter in a mocking imitation of the president, who has dealt with a stutter since childhood.

A Biden campaign spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, responded to Mr. Trump’s insults in a statement Sunday, contrasting the former president’s speech with Mr. Biden’s State of the Union address.

“Thursday night President Biden spoke about the kind of America he wants for our future — one based on the core values of honesty, decency, dignity, and respect for everyone — values that are unrecognizable to Donald Trump. Trump thinks mocking people and taking away their rights makes him look strong. But it just reveals how weak and insecure he is.”

The former president’s speech in Georgia, a key battleground state that he narrowly lost in 2020, underscored that Mr. Trump is not likely to temper the ominous and at times apocalyptic vision that has animated his campaign, even as his last remaining Republican rival has dropped out and the general election has come into focus.

As he has in the past, Mr. Trump insisted that the biggest danger facing the United States was his political opponents, whom he labeled “the threat from within,” a turn inward that has alarmed experts for its similarity to language used by totalitarian leaders.

But in a speech replete with digressive rants, Mr. Trump reserved some of his most incendiary rhetoric to vilify migrants crossing the border illegally. Much of his speech was focused on immigration, an issue that he and his advisers have signaled will be central to his efforts to defeat Mr. Biden and return to the White House.

While vowing to expand his crackdown on immigration, Mr. Trump described the continuing surge of migrants across the southern border as “the agony of our people, the plunder of our cities, the sacking of our towns, the violation of our citizens and the conquest of our country.”

Mr. Trump also took aim at Mr. Biden’s policies on immigration, in part by using the Georgia setting to blame his rival for the death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed in the state last month by, according to the authorities, a Venezuelan migrant who had entered the country illegally and had been released on parole.

Mr. Trump met with Ms. Riley’s parents before taking the stage, and the Trump campaign distributed signs at the rally with Ms. Riley’s photograph. During his speech, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Biden of neglecting the surge of migrants at the border, which he called a “deadly invasion that stole precious Laken’s beautiful American life.”

Mr. Trump often broadly casts those crossing the border illegally as violent criminals. “The migrants are hurting people,” Mr. Trump said. “They talk about the beautiful dream of migrants. It sounds so nice, you know, like in a fairy-tale book. But some of these people are monsters.”

Border authorities, including some who worked for Mr. Trump, have said that most of the migrants who cross the border are members of families fleeing violence and poverty.

But Ms. Riley’s death has become a flashpoint in the nation’s heated debate over immigration policy, in part because it seems to adhere to Mr. Trump’s long-stated belief that violent men from South America are flooding across the border to harm Americans.

“He was an illegal migrant, and he shouldn’t have been in our country, and he never would have been under the Trump policy,” Mr. Trump said of the man accused of killing Ms. Riley.

Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Biden for expressing regret that he used the word “illegal” to describe the man accused in Ms. Riley’s death during an exchange at the State of the Union address on Thursday.

Mr. Trump also lobbed several ad hominem attacks during the event. Of the former television anchor Megyn Kelly, with whom Mr. Trump sparred during his first presidential run, he said “may she rest in peace.” While talking about the success that his time on “The Apprentice” had brought NBC, he called Jeff Zucker, the network’s former chief executive, an “idiot.”

Mr. Trump also denigrated a number of prosecutors and judges involved in the criminal cases and multiple civil lawsuits in which he is entangled. He spent a considerable amount of time attacking Fani T. Willis, the district attorney prosecuting him over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia.

Mr. Trump called Ms. Willis “corrupt,” referring to allegations that she benefited financially after becoming romantically involved with a lawyer whom she hired on the case. (Ms. Willis has pushed back against those claims, calling them full of “wild and reckless speculation.”)

He also repeated his false contention that he won in Georgia in 2020, maintaining that he had done nothing wrong when he called state elections officials, insisted that he had won Georgia and asked Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” the votes he needed to win.

“Perfect phone call,” Mr. Trump said, “other than we challenged the honesty of this election. This election was rigged.”

NYTFEED020240321ek3l000ul,Russia Targets Kyiv With Biggest Missile Attack in Weeks,"Ukraine said it had intercepted all 31 missiles fired at the capital. But debris injured at least 13 people and damaged several buildings.

Russian missiles streaked into Kyiv early Thursday in the biggest assault on the Ukrainian capital in weeks, injuring at least 13 people and damaging several residential buildings and industrial facilities, according to local officials.","The Ukrainian Air Force said that air defense systems had intercepted all 31 of the Russian missiles that targeted Kyiv. Still, debris from the downed missiles fell in various parts of the city, causing the injuries and damage. No deaths have been reported so far.

“Such terror continues every day and night,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a social media post that included a video of firefighters dousing burning buildings with water.

The attack began in the early morning with loud blasts jolting residents awake around 5 a.m. as air defense systems went into action. Many people rushed to take shelter in subway stations. Several orange fireballs lit up the sky, apparently the result of missile interceptions.

Air-raid alerts ended at 6:10 a.m. just as sun rose, revealing the damage.

Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, said on Telegram that missile debris had caused fires in at least three residential buildings and in parking lots. He said emergency responders had been deployed to help victims. Four people were hospitalized, the city’s military administration said.

Photos of the aftermath of the attack released by Oleksiy Kuleba, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, and the local authorities showed burned-out cars in front of a building with a facade blackened by fire, a large hole at the foot of a pink building with all of its windows shattered, and a destroyed house on charred ground.

In the Podilskyi district, which is home to industrial facilities that Russia has targeted in the past, a plume of black smoke was rising early in the morning, suggesting a hit. Mr. Klitschko said a fire had broken out at a power substation in the area.

In the past, the targets of Russian air assaults have sometimes been unclear, and Ukrainian officials rarely confirm strikes on strategic industrial and military targets.

On Thursday, however, an official from Ukraine’s military intelligence services said most of the missiles had targeted the agency’s offices in the capital, but had been shot down before reaching their destination. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, and his claim could not be independently verified.

The assault Thursday came at a difficult time for Ukraine’s military, with Russian forces pressing ahead with ground attacks at several locations along the front line of more than 600 miles.

Faced with a shortfall of troops and ammunition, Ukraine has struggled to contain Russian assaults in its east and south. Ukrainian officials have vowed to launch a counteroffensive this year, but experts say the military has yet to receive the kinds of weapons that would let it regain the initiative on the battlefield, with American aid held up in Congress.

On Wednesday, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, made an unannounced trip to Kyiv in an effort to show the White House’s continued commitment to Ukraine’s defense. He urged Republican lawmakers to pass the stalled package of billions of dollars in aid.

“It has already taken too long,” Mr. Sullivan told reporters in a briefing at Ukraine’s presidential office. “And I know that — you know that.”

Thursday’s attack on Kyiv echoed a strategy used by Russia during air assaults in late December that consisted of overwhelming Ukraine’s air defenses with multiple launches of various types of missiles, including ballistic and hypersonic ones.

Russia has launched relatively few large-scale missile attacks in recent months, despite a capacity to produce more than 115 long-range missiles per month, according to Ukrainian officials.

Mr. Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukraine urgently needed more air defense systems from Western allies. He pointed to recent missile attacks on the cities of Kharkiv, Odesa and Kherson that claimed many lives.

“We need the support of our partners,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We must prove that terror is always the loser.”

NYTFEED020240318ek3i0073l,Trump Seeks to Appeal Ruling Allowing Prosecutor to Keep Georgia Case,"Because the defendants want to pursue an appeal now, ahead of any trial, Georgia law requires them to get permission from the judge who wrote the ruling.

Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and seven of his co-defendants in Georgia told a judge on Monday that they want to appeal his ruling allowing Fani T. Willis to continue prosecuting the election interference case against them.","Because the defendants want to pursue an appeal now, ahead of any trial, Georgia law requires them to get permission from the presiding judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton Superior Court. Even if Judge McAfee allows an appeal to go forward, the Georgia Court of Appeals would have to agree to take the case.

The judge’s ruling last Friday followed weeks of public hearings delving into a romantic relationship between Ms. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, and Nathan J. Wade, the lawyer she hired to run the Trump case. The defendants had argued that the relationship created an untenable conflict of interest for Ms. Willis.

Judge McAfee disagreed, but found that it had raised “a significant appearance of impropriety” that could be addressed by Mr. Wade withdrawing from the case.

In their filing on Monday, the defendants said that Mr. Wade’s resignation was “insufficient to cure the appearance of impropriety the court has determined exists.” If an appeal is not allowed now, they wrote, any eventual convictions could be subject to retrial if the judge’s decision is overturned later.

“The court’s order is ripe for pretrial appellate review,” Steven H. Sadow, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer in Georgia, said in a statement.

Ms. Willis’s office had no immediate comment. Neither she nor Mr. Wade have spoken publicly since the ruling, beyond releasing his resignation letter and her response to it. This weekend, the NBC show “Meet the Press” announced that Mr. Wade had agreed to come on the Sunday morning program for an interview. But hours later, it said that Mr. Wade had backed out.

The defendants’ motion on Monday also noted a speech that Ms. Willis gave at a church in Atlanta on Jan. 14, in which she suggested that criticism of her and Mr. Wade was prompted by racism. Mr. Sadow had argued that the speech itself was grounds for disqualifying Ms. Willis.

Judge McAfee, in his ruling last Friday, said that the speech was “legally improper,” but also that there was not enough legal precedent in Georgia to guide him on whether he should disqualify Ms. Willis for it.

In seeking the judge’s permission to pursue an appeal, the defendants argued that this lack of precedent was another reason for the appellate court to weigh in.

Mr. Trump and 14 others are charged with racketeering and a number of other crimes related to accusations that they conspired to overturn the former president’s 2020 election loss in the state. Four other defendants have already pleaded guilty.

Shortly after the indictments last summer, Ms. Willis asked for a trial to start this August. But the odds are low that it will happen that soon."
NYTFEED020240315ek3f003ux,"Russian Missile Strikes Kill at Least 20 in Odesa, Ukraine Says","Two missiles hit the same spot, Ukrainian authorities said, killing some rescuers who had responded to the first attack.

A Russian missile attack on Odesa killed at least 20 people and injured 73 others, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday, the latest in a series of deadly air assaults on the southern Ukrainian port city.","Ukraine’s state emergency services said a first missile hit several houses late in the morning, prompting rescuers to rush to the scene. A second missile then landed on the same site, causing many fatalities, including at least one paramedic and a rescue worker. The reports could not be independently verified.

Oleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region, posted photos on social media showing rescue workers evacuating one of their colleagues on a stretcher and trying to put out a fire near a destroyed building. A photo released by the Odesa City Council showed what appeared to be a rescuer lying on the grass, his lifeless body covered by a foil blanket.

Ukrainian authorities said the attacks destroyed a three-story building, damaged 10 houses and a gas pipeline, and started a fire that spread to an area of about 1,300 square feet.

It was the third deadly assault on Odesa in two weeks, with a total of at least 38 people killed. It came as Russians began voting in a presidential election that President Vladimir V. Putin was all but certain to win, and while his country’s war in Ukraine had entered its third year and showed no sign of abating.

On the same day, Russian authorities said Ukrainian shelling of the western city of Belgorod, close to Ukraine, had killed one civilian and wounded two others. Their claims could not be independently verified.

The Belgorod region has been the scene of cross-border ground attacks by Ukraine-backed Russian groups this week, apparently aimed at disrupting Mr. Putin’s re-election campaign messaging that the war had turned in Moscow’s favor. Russian forces have had the advantage on the battlefield in recent months, attacking simultaneously in several places all along the front line.

The assault on Odesa on Friday appeared to be what military officials call a “double-tap attack,” hitting the same target twice with a time gap between the two strikes in order to kill emergency workers or firefighters responding to the first strike. Russian forces have used this tactic before in Ukraine and Syria.

Videos posted online by Ukrainian reporters in Odesa showed bodies lying in pools of blood on the pavement, covered with a foil blanket, a simple sheet or a body bag. Andrii Vahapov, a member of the Odesa City Council, said those killed included Odesa’s former deputy mayor, Serhii Tetiukhin, and Oleksandr Hostishchev, the commander of a police special forces unit.

Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Army in the south, said the attack had involved ballistic missiles fired from Crimea, the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula.

Odesa, a lifeline for the Ukrainian economy, is home to a vast port infrastructure vital to Ukraine’s Black Sea exports. Many vessels depart from the port to ship grain and other agricultural products across the Black Sea.

The city, which Mr. Putin has long claimed belongs to Russia, was relatively untouched by the fighting at the start of the war. But over the past six months, Russia has targeted grain silos and naval infrastructure there with drones and missiles in an attempt to undermine Ukraine’s relatively successful Black Sea export operations.

The attacks have also caused civilian casualties, either from direct targeting or falling debris. Earlier this month, a drone hit a residential building, killing 12 civilians. It took rescue workers several days to pull the bodies from the rubble, including those of babies and children.

And last week, a missile hit the city while President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece were visiting, killing five people. Mr. Zelensky later told an Italian television station that the missile hit less than half a mile from the place where he was standing with Mr. Mitsotakis.

“I don’t know who this hit was aimed at,” Mr. Zelensky said, adding that it was “incredible” that Russia could target the city while state leaders were visiting. The attack drew widespread condemnation from foreign leaders.

Reacting to Friday’s strikes on Odesa, Mr. Zelensky said in a video statement that the double-tap tactic made it “a very vile attack.” He added that rescuers were continuing to search for people under the rubble."
NYTFEED020240307ek37004ed,4 Children and 2 Adults Are Killed in Ottawa Home,"The police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killings on Wednesday of a Sri Lankan family, the city’s largest mass murder in at least 30 years.

A woman from Sri Lanka and her four children were stabbed to death in a home in Ottawa by a student who is also from Sri Lanka, the police said on Thursday. Another man living in the home was also killed, and the children’s father was hospitalized with injuries.","Investigators charged Febrio De-Zoysa, 19, a student who also lived in the home, with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. He was arrested shortly after the police received two emergency calls around 11 p.m. Wednesday requesting they come to the home, which is in a residential neighborhood, police officers said.

Ottawa’s police chief, Eric Stubbs, said at a news conference that the stabbings were the largest mass killing in the city, Canada’s capital, in at least three decades.

“I want to emphasize this was a senseless act of violence perpetrated on purely innocent people,” Chief Stubbs said. “I know our whole community is shocked and mourning this event.”

The victims were identified as Darshani Banbaranayake Gama Walwwe Darshani Dilanthika Ekanyake, 35, the mother of the four children; Inuka Wickramasinghe, a 7-year-old boy; Ashwini Wickramasinghe, a 4-year-old girl; Rinyana Wickramasinghe, a 2-year-old girl; and Kelly Wickramasinghe, a 2-month-old girl.

The children’s father and Ms. Ekanyake’s husband, identified as Dhanushka Wickramasinghe in court documents, was seriously injured in the attack and was in stable condition at an area hospital.

Bhante Suneetha, a monk at the The Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery, where the family were active members, said that he spoke by phone on Thursday with Mr. Wickramasinghe, who he said is being hospitalized for slash wounds to his eyes and one of his hands.

Mr. Wickramasinghe told the monk that he arrived home from work on Wednesday night and was attacked when he opened the door, Mr. Suneetha said. Mr. Wickramasinghe was able to subdue his attacker before he discovered the other victims, he said.

Police officers said Mr. Wickramasinghe was seen on the street shouting for someone to call 911.

The sixth person killed, Amarakoonmubiayansela Ge Gamini Amarakoon, 40, was an acquaintance who had recently arrived from Sri Lanka and was living with the family. Mr. Suneetha said that he leaves a wife and two young children in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.

The police said they believed the victims were attacked with “an edged weapon” but did not provide any more details.

According to Mr. Suneetha, Mr. Wickramasinghe arrived on his own in Canada as a student in 2020 and the rest of the family followed about a year ago. After his graduation from college, Mr. Wickramasinghe worked in a restaurant before starting his own cleaning business.

The family, Mr. Suneetha said, came to Canada with so many “dreams and plans.”

“That is why they brought their kids here,” he said.

While he was in school, Mr. Wickramasinghe lived in another Sri Lankan family’s home. Mr. De-Zoysa also boarded there, according to Mr. Suneetha. After that arrangement fell apart, Mr. Wickramasinghe invited Mr. De-Zoysa to live in the basement of his family’s home.

Mr. Suneetha said the family recently celebrated Mr. De-Zoysa’s 19th birthday.

The Wickramasinghe family regularly helped organize events at the temple, and Inuka, the 7-year-old, began his studies in meditation and Buddhism a week ago, Mr. Suneetha said.

Members of the temple were meeting on Wednesday to work out plans for the funerals and to support Mr. Wickramasinghe, as well as the family of Mr. Amarakoon.

Two police SUVs remained parked at the home nearly a full day after the killings. The police chief said it would take several days to process the scene.

Shanti Ramesh, a neighbor, said she saw about 15 police cruisers rush to the home on Wednesday night.

Ms. Ramesh watched as investigators began rolling out yellow crime-scene tape in front of the home. She went to bed thinking the scene would be cleared up overnight.

“But when I saw the news in the morning, it was a shock that such a big tragedy happened in our city and just across my house,” she said, adding that she did not know the family who lived in the home.

Mass killings are rare in Canada, where the homicide rate in 2022 was about 2.3 killings per 100,000 people, about one-third of the rate in the United States that year.

There were 874 murders in Canada in 2022, according to the latest data from the census agency. They represented an 8 percent rise in the country’s homicide rate and the fourth year of consecutive increases.

Mark Sutcliffe, the mayor of Ottawa, offered his condolences.

“We are fortunate to live in a safe city where these events are extremely rare,” he said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon. “Everyone, understandably, will react to this news today and feel less safe and secure.”

About 100 people gathered at a gazebo on the edge of Palmadeo Park, just two blocks from the crime scene, for a memorial vigil on Thursday evening. Some stayed for a while; others stopped only to leave teddy bears, letters or bouquets of flowers.

“They were so sweet, they were caring, they were kind. It was honestly very devastating,” Dayna Craigie, a former educational assistant at the children’s school, said. “I’m remembering them as innocent children who should not have had their lives taken away from them.”

Neela Singh looked on with her two children, ages 4 and 11. They went to school with the victims, she said. Through tears, Ms. Singh described that afternoon’s school pickup as somber.

“There were so many people around, yet no sound until the teacher came out,” she said.

After the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the temple began holding special counseling and mediation sessions for students from Sri Lanka who, Mr. Suneetha said, seemed to be under ever-increasing stress.

“After the pandemic, the society here in Canada is not so well,” he said.

Recovery, Mr. Suneetha added, will take time for the temple’s 120 members. The temple is a hub for many members of the Sri Lankan community, including several hundred people who are not members of the temple, he said.

“We will definitely need help from the society,” Mr. Suneetha said. “Not just from the Sri Lankan community, but the whole community.”"

The air base is named after the small town of Kucova, 85 kilometers (52 miles) south of the capital Tirana.","Officials said the new air base will serve as a modern hub of operations, for training and hosting an array of fighter jets.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama welcomed the reactivation of the air base, which was officially closed in 2005, as ""another element of security from our region of the Western Balkans, which we know well may be endangered from the neo-imperialist threats and ambitions of the Russian Federation.”

After the speeches at the ceremony, two U.S. F-16 and two F-35 fighter jets from Aviano Air Base in Italy flew over while two Eurofighters landed.

NATO funded the base upgrade with around 50 million euros. It included renovations to the control tower, runways, hangars and storage facilities.

“The makeover of Kucova air base is a strategic investment and shows that NATO continues to strengthen its presence in the Western Balkans, an area of strategic importance to the alliance,” said NATO's acting spokesperson, Dylan White.

Rama said that Tirana also offered and was discussing with NATO a naval base in western Albania.

Albania joined NATO in 2009 and is a candidate for EU membership.

APRS000020240309ek3900k51," Pope Francis: Ukraine should have the courage of the 'white flag,' negotiate end of war with Russia ","ROME (AP) — Pope Francis said in an interview that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should have the courage to negotiate an end to the war with Russia and not be ashamed to sit at the same table to carry out peace talks.

The pope made his appeal during an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, which was partially released on Saturday.","“I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers.

Ukraine remains firm on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said multiple times the initiative in peace negotiations must belong to the country which has been invaded.

Russia is gaining momentum on the battlefield in the war now in its third year and Ukraine is running low on ammunition. Meanwhile, some of Ukraine’s allies in the West are delicately raising the prospect of sending troops.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Saturday that Francis picked up the “white flag” term that had been used by the interviewer. He issued a statement of clarification after the pope’s “white flag” comments sparked criticism that he was siding with Russia in the conflict.

Throughout the war, Francis has tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality, but that has often been accompanied by apparent sympathy with the Russian rationale for invading Ukraine, such as when he noted that NATO was “barking at Russia’s door” with its eastward expansion.

Francis said in the RSI interview that “the word negotiate is a courageous word.”

""When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,” he said. “Negotiations are never a surrender.”

The pope also reminded people that some countries have offered to act as mediators in the conflict.

“Today, for example, in the war in Ukraine, there are many who want to mediate,” he said. “Turkey has offered itself for this. And others. Do not be ashamed to negotiate before things get worse.""

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — whose NATO-member country has sought to balance its close relations with both Ukraine and Russia — has offered during a visit Friday from Zelenskyy to host a peace summit between the two countries."
APRS000020240304ek34004mp," Newly enlarged NATO starts drill in Finland, Norway and Sweden in defense of its Nordic turf ","HELSINKI (AP) — NATO kicked off an exercise on Monday to defend its newly expanded Nordic territory when more than 20,000 soldiers from 13 nations take part in drills lasting nearly two weeks in the northern regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden.

With over 4,000 Finnish soldiers taking part, the Norway-led Nordic Response 2024 represents the NATO newcomer's largest ever participation in a foreign exercise, according to Finland's military.","“For the first time, Finland will participate as a NATO member nation in exercising collective defense of the alliance’s regions,” the Finnish Defense Forces said in a statement.

The Swedish Armed Forces said about 4,500 personnel from its air force, army and navy would take part in the drill, which is being conducted in demanding Arctic winter conditions.

Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, joined NATO in April 2023 in a historic move following decades of military non-alignment. With its bid now ratified by all NATO members, neighboring Sweden is currently finalizing formalities to enter the military alliance as its 32nd member — most likely in March.

Both Sweden and Finland had developed strong ties with NATO after the end of the Cold War, but public opinion remained firmly against full membership until Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Nonalignment was seen as the best way to avoid tensions with Russia, their powerful neighbor in the Baltic Sea region. But the Russian aggression caused a dramatic shift in public opinion in both countries, and they applied jointly for NATO membership in May 2022.

For years, the biannual NATO drill, which has been conducted in the Arctic extremes of northern Norway, was called “Cold Response.”

However, “thanks to the NATO expansion with Finland and eventually Sweden, we are now expanding the exercise to a Nordic Response,” the Norwegian Armed Forces said on its website. This year, the drill is hosted equally by Finland, Norway and Sweden.

The pan-Nordic drill is part of Steadfast Defender 24, NATO's biggest exercises in decades, with up to 90,000 troops involved over several months of drills that are aimed at showing that the alliance can defend all of its territory up to its border with Russia.

The participating nations in the current exercise that runs through March 15 are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

Roughly half of the participating troops will drill on land. The rest will train at sea, with over 50 participating submarines, frigates, corvettes, aircraft carriers, and various amphibious vessels, and in the air with more than 100 fighter jets, transport aircraft, maritime surveillance aircraft and helicopters, according to the Norwegian military.

The combined joint training will focus on the defense and protection of the Nordic region, Norwegian military officials said.

“We need to be able to fight back and stop anyone who tries to challenge our borders, values and democracy,” said Brigadier Tron Strand from the Royal Norwegian Air Force, Commander of the Norwegian Air Operations Center, in a statement. “With the current security situation in Europe, the exercise is extremely relevant and more important than ever before,” he added.

“The High North represents an important and strategically located area for NATO” and the Nordic Response 2024 exercise “increases Nordic preparedness and the capability to conduct large-scale joint operations in challenging weather and climate,"" NATO said on its website.

APRS000020240307ek3700kwt," Sweden officially joins NATO, ending decades of post-World War II neutrality ","WASHINGTON (AP) — Sweden on Thursday formally joined NATO as the 32nd member of the transatlantic military alliance, ending decades of post-World War II neutrality and centuries of broader non-alignment with major powers as security concerns in Europe have spiked following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

President Joe Biden congratulated Sweden on its admission and said it was a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intervention in Ukraine had united, rather than divided, the alliance.","“When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, he thought he could weaken Europe and divide NATO,” Biden said in a statement.

“Instead, in May 2022, Sweden and Finland — two of our close partners, with two highly capable militaries — made the historic decision to apply for full NATO membership,"" Biden said. ”With the addition of Sweden today, NATO stands more united, determined, and dynamic than ever — now 32 nations strong.""

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was a guest of honor Thursday evening at Biden's State of the Union address to Congress, where the president welcomed him to “the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen.”

Earlier Thursday, Kristersson and Secretary of State Antony Blinken presided at a ceremony in which Sweden’s “instrument of accession” to the alliance was officially deposited at the State Department.

“This is a historic moment for Sweden. It's historic for the alliance. It's historic for the transatlantic relationship,” Blinken said. “Our NATO alliance is now stronger, larger than it’s ever been.”

“Today is truly a historic day,” Kristersson said. “We are humbled, but we are also proud. We will live up to high expectations from all NATO allies. United we stand. Unity and solidarity will be Sweden’s guiding light.""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also described it as “a historic day.”

“Sweden will now take its rightful place at NATO’s table, with an equal say in shaping NATO policies and decisions,” he said in a statement.

The Swedish flag will be raised outside the military organization’s headquarters in Brussels on Monday. Stoltenberg underscored that the Nordic country “now enjoys the protection granted under Article 5, the ultimate guarantee of allies’ freedom and security.”

Article 5 of NATO’s treaty obliges all members to come to the aid of an ally whose territory or security is under threat. It has only been activated once – by the U.S. after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks – and is the collective security guarantee that Sweden has sought since Russia invaded Ukraine.

“Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer and the whole alliance more secure,” Stoltenberg said. He added that the move “demonstrates that NATO’s door remains open and that every nation has the right to choose its own path.”

Sweden, along with Finland, which joined NATO last year, both abandoned the long-standing military neutrality that was a hallmark of the Nordic states’ Cold War foreign policy after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.

Biden, in his speech to Congress, stepped up calls for reluctant Republicans to approve stalled military assistance to Ukraine as the war enters its third year.

“If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not,"" Biden said. “But Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons it needs to defend itself.”

Biden and his NATO counterparts have vowed that Ukraine will join NATO one day, too.

Sweden’s membership had been held up due to objections by NATO members Turkey and Hungary. Turkey expressed concern that Sweden was harboring and not taking enough action against Kurdish groups that it regards as terrorists, and Hungary's populist President Viktor Orban has shown pro-Russian sentiment and not shared the alliance’s determination to support Ukraine.

After months of delay, Turkey ratified Sweden’s admission earlier this year, and Hungary did so this week.

APRS000020240327ek3r009hp, Quran-burning Iraqi man who faces an expulsion order from Sweden plans to seek asylum in Norway ,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — An Iraqi man who carried out several Quran burnings in Sweden told a newspaper on Wednesday that he would seek asylum in neighboring Norway in the wake of a deportation order by authorities in Stockholm.

Salwan Momika, 37, has staged several burnings and desecrations of the sacred book of Islam in Sweden over the past few years.","“I am on my way to Norway,” Momika said in an interview published Wednesday by Swedish tabloid Expressen. “Sweden only accepts terrorists who are granted asylum and given protection, while philosophers and thinkers are expelled.”

Videos of Momika’s provocative Quran burnings got worldwide publicity and raised anger and criticism in several Muslim nations, leading to riots and unrest in many places. He is currently being investigated by Swedish authorities for incitement against ethnic groups in Sweden.

According to Expressen, Momika is one of the reasons why Sweden’s NATO membership, which was finalized earlier this month, got delayed by months. Among other countries, his actions got wide publicity in NATO member Turkey, which vetoed Stockholm's bid to join the military alliance for a lengthy period.

Sweden’s migration authorities revoked Momika’s residence permit in October, saying he had provided incorrect information on his application and he would be deported to Iraq. But his deportation has been on hold for security reasons, because according to Momika, his life could be in danger if he were returned to his native country.

Swedish media reported that Momika was granted a residence permit in 2021. In connection with last year's deportation decision, Momika was granted a new temporary residence permit that expires on April 16, according to Expressen.

“I am moving to a country that welcomes me and respects me. Sweden doesn't respect me,” Momika told the newspaper, adding that he had already entered Norway and was on his way to the capital, Oslo.

There was no immediate comment available from Norwegian authorities."
APRS000020240312ek3c007pt, An expanding NATO uses its diversity as strength. Member troops know Russia is watching ,"ABOARD THE FRENCH FRIGATE NORMANDIE (AP) — The French navy frigate, bristling with weaponry and powering through frigid Norwegian seas not so far from Russia, awoke at 7:30 a.m. sharp to what, in the circumstances, was a surreal sound.

The 1967 “ Summer of Love "" hippie anthem “San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)"" was playing over the warship's public address system. Singer Scott McKenzie's voice reverberated through the passageways starting to bustle with sailors clutching coffee mugs: “All across the nation, such a strange vibration, people in motion.""","It was a slice of Americana rousing one of France's most modern fighting vessels, beginning another day under Italian command, in war games involving 13 nations.

And that, in a nutshell, is NATO: a multinational alliance built around the idea that its 32 countries spread across three continents could turn their diversity into strength and fight as one if the need arose.

The Nordic Response 2024 exercises — bringing together more than 20,000 soldiers with different languages, equipment, habits and histories — are intended to foster the teamwork necessary for the alliance to function.

They are training with the knowledge that Russia and other potential adversaries are watching for any weaknesses in NATO defenses and unity.

Among the nations drilling is Sweden, NATO’s 32nd and newest member. Its induction last week and the addition of Finland last year dramatically illustrated how Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, shifted Europe’s post-Cold War security landscape.

From shunning military alliances, the two Nordic nations reached for NATO's security umbrella and its guarantee that an attack on any one member would be considered as an attack on them all.

In the frozen extremes of northern Finland, Norway and Sweden, the NATO drills are a test for troops and their fighting machines. Participating nations are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

The nearly two weeks of drills conclude this week. They are part of a months-long program of NATO maneuvers dubbed Steadfast Defender 24 that are its biggest since the Cold War, with 90,000 troops. The alliance says the intention is “to demonstrate NATO’s ability to defend every inch of its territory” — an unmistakable signal to Russia.

Certainly, participating troops suspect that Russia is watching.

Aboard the French frigate Normandie, the crew of 146 scrambled to battle stations when an unknown aircraft that came from the direction of Russia strayed too close for comfort last week, in international airspace north of the warship's Nordic Response patrol zone in Arctic waters.

The Normandie's commanding officer, Capt. Thomas Vuong, told Associated Press journalists aboard that the flight appeared to have been a Russian test of NATO readiness. Norway scrambled F-35 fighters to intercept the aircraft, which headed back in Russia's direction, he said.

NATO regularly scrambles jets to scope Russian flights, taking to the skies for more than 500 interceptions in 2022. The number dropped but was still more than 300 encounters in 2023, the Brussels-headquartered alliance says.

“These are maneuvers that are fairly standard, maneuvers where the Russians test the procedures,"" Vuong said, speaking exclusively to AP. Russia has “resources in the skies, at sea that are employed and which enable them to test the alliance's defenses.""

Listening to the NATO drills' radio traffic gives a flavor of the melting pot of nations and cultures in the transatlantic organization. Communications are in English but accents betray the array of nationalities: French, Italian, German, British, American and more.

“We have a technical vocabulary and everyone uses it,"" said Lt. Olivier, pilot of the Normandie's submarine-hunting NH90 helicopter. The French military withheld his family name for security reasons.

“As you can hear, it’s not perfect English,” he said. ""But since it’s always the same technical words, everyone is able to understand the picture, the situation, and to react if necessary.”

In the decades since its founding by 12 countries in 1949, NATO has worked to standardize procedures and equipment to enable troops to work and, if necessary, fight together more readily. The flight deck of the Normandie, for example, is equipped to receive other countries' helicopters.

The alliance “functions because there are military headquarters developing interoperability within NATO, which means we ensure that we have systems that function together, that communicate together,"" Vuong said. “This gives us the capability to operate together when we meet at sea.”

Vuong added that he senses “a real willingness” from alliance sailors “to make sure we raise our standard within NATO as high as possible.”

Lt. Sebastian, a German navy officer who hitched a ride aboard the Normandie to make a port call during the exercises, said working with and learning from other NATO nations helps alliance troops improve. He wouldn't give his family name.

“Of course you can do your job on your own, going to sea with just one ship,"" he said. But ""NATO means a whole group of abilities and that is what we train here, to use all the abilities combined together.”

APRS000020240328ek3s00i21, Central and Eastern European countries mark 20 years in NATO with focus on war in Ukraine ,"VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Several central and Eastern European countries began marking on Thursday the 20th anniversary of the largest expansion of the NATO military alliance when formerly socialist countries became members of the bloc.

Military aircraft roared over the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. At the main airbase hosting Spanish and Portuguese fighter jets tasked with NATO air policing missions in the Baltic region, officials gathered to commemorate the event.","“Russia’s new bloody terror in Europe is contributing to the growth of instability and threats around the world. However, we in Lithuania are calm because we know that we will never be alone again,” said President Gitanas Nauseda, standing near the runway where the first NATO jets landed back in 2004. “We will always have a strong, supportive Alliance family by our side, and we will face any challenges together.”

Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined NATO on March 29 in 2004, bringing the total membership of the Alliance to 26. The seven nations started accession negotiations soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and eventually were invited to join at the Prague Summit in November 2002. Another group of former Soviet satellites including Poland and the Czech Republic had been admitted several years earlier.

Since joining the alliance, these countries often warned about the threat of Russia, using their national trauma of Soviet occupation as proof of credibility. While Western nations often dismissed their sometimes hawkish attitude, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is seen as a vindication of those fears. They have given some of the most robust responses, helping Ukraine with equipment and money, and pushing for even greater sanctions on Russia.

Most of the former Soviet Republics that joined NATO at the turn of the millennium spend more than the required 2% of gross domestic product on defense. When Romania’s President Klaus Iohannis announced his bid earlier this month to become the next leader of the alliance, he emphasized the threat from Russia and said the alliance needs a “renewal of perspectives” that Eastern Europe could provide.

“Russia is proving to be a serious and long-term threat to our continent, to our Euro-Atlantic security,” the 65-year-old said when he announced his bid. “NATO’s borders become of paramount importance, and the strengthening of the eastern flank ... will remain a long-term priority.”

The seven countries are marking the anniversary with solemn events and shows of force, but also some levity, with open-air concerts and exhibitions.

“Twenty years ago the Bulgarian people made the right choice for our country to join NATO,” the country’s defense chief Adm. Emil Eftimov said. “Given today’s security situation, this is the most appropriate decision we have made in our recent history.”

NATO was established in the aftermath of World War II.

APRS000020240309ek3900ci1, Poland's foreign minister says the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine is 'not unthinkable' ,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's foreign minister says the presence of NATO forces “is not unthinkable” and that he appreciates the French president for not ruling out that idea.

Radek Sikorski made the observation during a discussion marking the 25th anniversary of Poland's NATO membership in the Polish parliament on Friday, and the Foreign Ministry tweeted the comments later in English.","Last month French President Emmanuel Macron said the possibility of Western troops being sent to Ukraine could not be ruled out, a comment that prompted an outcry from other leaders.

French officials later sought to clarify Macron’s remarks and tamp down the backlash, while insisting on the need to send a clear signal to Russia that it cannot win its war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin has warned that if NATO sends combat troops, a direct conflict between the alliance and Russia would be inevitable. Russian President Vladimir Putin said such a move would risk a global nuclear conflict.

Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk was among those European leaders who ruled out sending troops to Ukraine after Macron's remarks, saying: “Poland does not plan to send its troops to the territory of Ukraine.""

Sikorski did not speak of a plan to send Polish troops to Ukraine, but struck a different tone.

“The presence of #NATO forces in Ukraine is not unthinkable,"" he said, according to the Foreign Ministry. He said he appreciated Macron's initiative “because it is about Putin being afraid, not us being afraid of Putin.”

Polish President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Tusk will travel to Washington for a meeting at the White House next Tuesday. The Poles are hoping to spur the United States to do more to help Ukraine.

Poland is a member of NATO along the alliance's eastern flank, with Ukraine across its eastern border. The country has been under Russian control in the past, and fears run high that if Russia wins in Ukraine, it could next target other countries in a region that Moscow views as its sphere of interest."
APRS000020240312ek3c00id5, Senior US official travels to Kosovo to revive Kosovo-Serbia talks after tensions over currency ,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A senior U.S. official on Tuesday said he would be visiting Kosovo in the next days to put “back on track” talks on normalizing ties between Kosovo and Serbia, after tensions escalated over Kosovo's decision to ban the use of the Serbian dinar.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Gabriel Escobar said he would discuss with Kosovo authorities a possible resolution of the “uncoordinated decision"" to ban Serbia’s dinar and transfers from Serbia to citizens of Kosovo who depend on social services and payments.","The government of Kosovo banned banks and other financial institutions in ethnic Serbian-dominated areas, especially in Kosovo’s north, from using the dinar in local transactions starting Feb. 1, and imposed the euro. The dinar was widely used to pay pensions and salaries to staff in Serbian-run institutions, including schools and hospitals.

The ban angered both Kosovo Serbs and Serbia, and has fueled Western concerns about regional tensions as a full-scale war rages in Ukraine.

Escobar acknowledged that Washington and Brussels were struggling to get Pristina-Belgrade dialogue “back on track.”

“There is no other alternative than the EU facilitated dialogue,” Escobar told an online news conference from Brussels, urging Pristina and Belgrade “to show goodwill and prevent any provocations.”

Brussels has warned both that refusal to compromise jeopardizes Serbia and Kosovo's chances of joining the bloc, which is mediating a dialogue between the former foes. Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s formal declaration of independence in 2008.

In 1999, a 78-day NATO bombing campaign ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Serbian forces were pushed out but Belgrade still considers it a Serbian province.

In May last year, Kosovo Serbs clashed with security forces, including NATO-led KFOR peacekeepers, injuring 93 troops, in a dispute with Pristina over the validity of local elections in the Serbian minority-dominated part of northern Kosovo.

Kosovo has agreed to hold referendums in four Serb-majority municipalities on April 21 on whether to oust their ethnic Albanian mayors, whose election last year raised tensions between Serbia and Kosovo.

In September, a Kosovo police officer and three Serb gunmen were killed in a shootout after about 30 masked men opened fire on a police patrol near the Kosovo village of Banjska.

APRS000020240305ek3500gl9," Hungary's president formally signs the approval of Sweden's NATO bid, removing last obstacle ","BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary’s president on Tuesday formally signed a bill approving Sweden's NATO bid, removing the last obstacle after 18 months of delays that frustrated the alliance as it sought to expand in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.

President Tamás Sulyok's signature was needed to put into force a bill that was passed in Hungary's parliament last month in a culmination of months of wrangling by Hungary’s allies to convince its nationalist government to lift its block on Sweden’s membership.","“It is incredibly positive,” Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson said in Stockholm. He told his visiting German counterpart Boris Pistorius: “You really come at a historic time for Sweden as we are about to become full fledged members of NATO.""

""That decision will make Sweden safer and NATO’s stronger,” said Jonson.

Pistorius said he was “delighted because at last, good friends turn into allies as members of NATO, and we are welcoming you with open arms to this important alliance.”

The government of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán first submitted the protocols for approving Sweden’s entry into NATO in July 2022, but the matter stalled in parliament over opposition by governing party lawmakers.

Hungary’s decision paved the way for the second expansion of NATO’s ranks in a year after both Sweden and Finland applied to join the alliance in May 2022 following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — an assault that was purportedly intended to prevent further NATO expansion.

Unanimous support among NATO members is required to admit new countries, and Hungary was the last of the alliance’s 31 members to give its backing since Turkey ratified the request in January.

Orbán, a right-wing populist who has forged close ties with Russia, has said that criticism of Hungary’s democracy by Swedish politicians soured relations between the two countries and led to reluctance among lawmakers in his Fidesz party.

Sulyok took office on Tuesday, following the resignation of President Katalin Novák, who stepped down last month in a scandal over her decision to pardon to a man convicted of covering up a string of child sexual abuses.

Sulyok is a former president of Hungary’s Constitutional Court. The endorsement of Sweden's NATO bid was his first act as president.

APRS000020240327ek3r005v5, Chinese leader Xi tells Dutch PM that restricting technology access won't stop China's advance ,"BEIJING (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping told visiting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Wednesday that attempts to restrict China's access to technology will not stop the country's advance.

The Netherlands imposed export licensing requirements in 2023 on the sale of machinery that can make advanced processor chips. The move came after the United States blocked Chinese access to advanced chips and the equipment to make them, citing security concerns, and urged its allies to follow suit.","An online report from state broadcaster CCTV did not mention the chip machinery, but quoted Xi as saying that the creation of scientific and technological barriers and the fragmentation of the industrial and supply chains will lead to division and confrontation.

""The Chinese people also have the right to legitimate development, and no force can stop the pace of China’s scientific and technological development and progress,” Xi said, according to CCTV.

Dutch company ASML is the world’s only producer of machines that use extreme ultraviolet lithography to make advanced semiconductors. In 2023, China became ASML’s second-largest market, accounting for 29% of its revenue as Chinese companies bought up equipment before the licensing requirement took effect.

Rutte, speaking to journalists after his meeting, declined to go into specifics of the talks.

“What I can tell you is that ... when we have to take measures, that they are never aimed at one country specifically, that we always try to make sure that the impact is limited, is not impacting the supply chain, and therefore is not impacting the overall economic relationship,” he said.

The Dutch leader, who was accompanied by Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen on the trip, said the top issue for him in their meetings with Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang was the war in Ukraine.

China has taken a neutral position on the war, providing Russia with diplomatic cover and economic support through trade. That stance has angered and frustrated much of Europe, which sees Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim.

Rutte said it's important for China to understand that ""this is a direct security threat for us, because if Russia will be successful in Ukraine, it will be a threat to the whole of Europe. It will not end with Ukraine.”

He added that he had asked China's leaders “to put their considerable weight — and they can do that as far as I'm concerned in a very discreet way — but as much as possible on Russia to influence the course of events.”

ASML, the Netherlands’ largest company, recently threatened to leave the country over anti-immigration policies that may impact the company’s ability to hire talent, leaving government officials scrambling to ensure that the firm does not leave.

Van Leeuwen said this week in an interview with The FD, a Dutch business newspaper, that protecting the interests of ASML is a top priority but acknowledged that national security comes before economic interests.

Beijing has repeatedly accused the U.S. of trying to hold back China’s economic development by restricting access to technology. In response, Xi has launched a campaign to develop home-grown chips and other high-tech products.

“China always opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security and making various excuses to coerce other countries into imposing a technological blockade against China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in January.

Rutte said that NATO and its growing ties with Asia did not come up at Wednesday’s talks. He is a leading candidate to be the next head of the alliance, which China has criticized for provoking regional tensions and making diplomatic forays into the Asia-Pacific region.

APRS000020240313ek3d00etd," Germany's Scholz defends his refusal to send Ukraine Taurus missiles, says prudence is a virtue ","BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz defended his refusal to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, telling German lawmakers Wednesday that prudence is not a weakness while insisting that he trusts Kyiv.

Germany has become the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States, but Scholz has stalled for months on Ukraine’s desire for Taurus missiles, which have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles) and could in theory be used against targets far into Russian territory.","That position has frustrated the main center-right opposition bloc and parts of Scholz's three-party coalition. The criticism didn't diminish after Scholz finally offered a detailed explanation last month, pointing to his insistence that Germany must not become directly involved in the war.

The chancellor has long emphasized his determination to help Ukraine without escalating the war and drawing Germany and NATO into it, stressing that no German soldiers will go to Ukraine. Over the past two years, he has at times drawn criticism for appearing to hesitate before pledging new weapons systems, such as the Leopard 2 battle tanks, to Kyiv.

Scholz has dug in much harder on Taurus missiles, though he has stopped short of explicitly ruling out ever delivering them.

“From my point of view, this is a very long-range weapon,” he told parliament's lower house, the Bundestag. “Given the significance of not losing control over targets, this weapon could not be used without the deployment of German soldiers. I reject that.”

Highlighting Germany's extensive contributions to Ukraine's defense, Scholz said “it remains central that we weigh every individual decision carefully.”

“Prudence is not something that one can qualify as a weakness, as some do,” he said. “Prudence is something that the citizens of our country are entitled to.”

Critics reject Scholz's insistence that Taurus missiles could only be responsibly used with the involvement of German soldiers whether inside or outside Ukraine — which he said is “a line that I as chancellor do not want to cross.”

In a sometimes testy exchange with conservative lawmakers at a regular question-and-answer session, Scholz rejected the suggestion that he didn't trust Ukraine to use the missiles responsibly.

“We trust Ukraine — that's why Germany is by a long distance the biggest supplier of weapons among the European states,"" he said.

Britain and France have long since announced that they were sending Storm Shadow and Scalp long-range missiles, respectively, to Ukraine. But Scholz said last month that “what is being done in the way of target control and accompanying target control on the part of the British and the French can’t be done in Germany.” He didn't elaborate then or on Wednesday.

Conservative lawmaker Norbert Röttgen accused Scholz of “not explaining the real motives for your policy, (and) repeatedly finding new excuses that in part contradict each other and rule each other out.”

On Feb. 22, German lawmakers called on the government to deliver further long-range weapons to Ukraine but voted down an opposition call explicitly urging it to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles.

On Thursday, the center-right opposition is putting a new motion urging the government to send Taurus missiles to a vote in the Bundestag, hoping to exploit divisions in the governing coalition.

The embarrassing leak of a recording of four high-ranking German air force officers discussing hypothetically how Kyiv could use Taurus missiles against Russian forces was barely alluded to in Wednesday's session."

APRS000020240313ek3d00b41, Denmark plans to expand military draft to women for the first time and extend service terms ,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark wants to increase the number of young people doing military service by extending conscription to women and increasing the time of service from 4 months to 11 months for both genders, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Wednesday.

“We do not rearm because we want war. We are rearming because we want to avoid it,” Frederiksen told a press conference. She said the government wants ”full equality between the sexes.”","Denmark currently has up to 9,000 professional troops on top of the 4,700 conscripts undergoing basic training, according to official figures. The government wants to increase the number of conscripts by 300 to reach a total of 5,000.

The country is a member of the NATO alliance and a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia’s invasion.

Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen stressed that “Russia does not pose a threat to Denmark.”

“But we will not bring ourselves to a place where they could come to do that,” Løkke Rasmussen said.

All physically fit men over the age of 18 are called up for military service, which lasts roughly four months. However, because there are enough volunteers, there is a lottery system, meaning not all young men serve.

In 2023, there were 4,717 conscripts in Denmark. Women who volunteered for military service accounted for 25.1% of the cohort, according to official figures.

Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the new system would require a change in the law, which he said will happen in 2025 and take effect in 2026.

The security policy situation in Europe “has become more and more serious, and we have to take that into account when we look at future defense,” Lund Poulsen said. “A broader basis for recruiting that includes all genders is needed,"" he said, adding it will create ""a more versatile and more complete defense.”

Under the plan for which there likely is a majority in the Danish parliament, conscripts will first spend five months in basic training, followed by six months in operational service along with supplementary training.

In 2017, neighboring Sweden instituted a military draft for both men and women because the Swedish government spoke of a deteriorating security environment in Europe and around Sweden. The Scandinavian country had previously abolished compulsory military service for men in 2010 because there were enough volunteers to meet its military needs. It never had a military draft for women before.

Norway introduced a law in 2013 applying military conscription to both sexes."
APRS000020240312ek3c00d71, Vatican diplomats seek to defuse outrage over Pope Francis' Ukraine 'white flag' comments ,"ROME (AP) — The Vatican secretary of state is seeking to defuse outrage over Pope Francis' latest diplomatic foray, insisting in media interviews that a primary condition for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine is an end to Russia’s aggression and that any peace must be a “just peace.”

Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s chief diplomat, made the rounds with friendly Italian media the same day Kyiv summoned the Holy See ambassador to complain about Francis’ comments that Ukraine should have the “courage of the white flag” to negotiate an end to the war.","Francis’ remarks to Swiss broadcaster RSI, recorded in early February but only aired on Saturday, elicited immediate criticism from Ukraine and its allies, even after the Vatican press office tried to redirect attention to Francis’ other remarks in the interview that “negotiation is never a surrender.”

The ruckus once again put the Vatican’s diplomatic corps in the position of having to smooth over Francis’ informal, off-the-cuff way of speaking, providing a more articulated position in line with the Holy See’s tradition of calibrated diplomatic neutrality.

In an interview with leading Corriere della Sera published Tuesday, Parolin noted that Francis in another speech last month had called for a diplomatic solution in Ukraine and the search for a just and lasting peace.

“In that sense, it’s obvious that the creation of such conditions aren’t just for one side, but both sides, and the first condition would be that of putting an end to the aggression,” Parolin said in comments that also were reported by the Vatican’s in-house Vatican News portal.

Parolin noted that Francis’ “white flag” comments were in response to a question that used the term, and that the pontiff subsequently insisted that “negotiation is never a surrender.”

The cardinal made similar comments to Italy's state-run RAI, saying: ""Peace in Ukraine will have to be a just peace. It means recognizing mutual rights and also mutual duties, above all, taking into account the dignity of people.”

It’s not the first time Francis’ sometimes imprecise way of speaking, which is often appreciated in other contexts because of its simplicity, have created a diplomatic headache for the Holy See and angered one or the other side in the war.

He has repeatedly expressed solidarity with the “martyred” Ukrainian people but refused to call out Russia or President Vladimir Putin by name. He has seemingly expressed understanding for the invasion Putin ordered by saying NATO was “barking at Russia’s door” by expanding east, but then earned a formal protest from Moscow when he blamed most of the cruelty on Chechens and other minorities.

In September, Francis again courted the displeasure of Ukrainians, including its Greek Catholic bishops, when he praised Russia’s imperial past during a meeting with Russian youths. After Ukrainians voiced their sense of betrayal, Francis later acknowledged his words were “perhaps not happy” and that he in no way meant to justify Russia’s invasion.

Duda wants members of the NATO alliance to raise their spending on defense to 3% of their GDP as Russia puts its own economy on a war footing and pushes forward with its plans to conquer Ukraine. Poland already spends 4% of its own economic output on defense, double the current target of 2% for NATO nations.","The Polish leader made the call as he and Tusk visited Washington to mark their country's 25th anniversary of joining the now 32-member transatlantic military alliance. It was a historic step into the West after breaking free from Moscow’s sphere of influence after decades of communist rule.

“Russia's aggression against Ukraine really demonstrated that United States is and should remain the security leader,” Duda said. “But other allies must take more responsibility for the security of the alliance as a whole. Two percent was good 10 years ago. Now 3% is required in response for the full scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO's eastern border.”

Biden called the U.S. commitment to Poland ironclad and marveled at Poland's current defense spending and thanked the leaders for taking in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees after Russia launched the February 2022 invasion. But he did not directly address Duda's call for NATO members to ramp up spending.

“When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,” Biden said, recalling the words of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright upon Poland's accession into the alliance. ”I believed that then and I believe that now. And we see it with Polish and American troops serving side by side with NATO on the eastern flank, including in Poland.""

Biden administration officials, however, suggested ahead of the meeting that Duda’s call to raise the defense spending target for NATO countries may be, at least for the time being, overly ambitious.

""I think the first step is to get every country meeting the 2% threshold, and we’ve seen improvement of that,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. “But I think that’s the first step before we start talking about an additional proposal.”

The visit also comes amid a standoff in Washington between Biden, a Democrat, and House Republicans on Ukraine funding. House Republicans have blocked a $118 billion bipartisan package that includes $60 billion in Ukraine funding, as well as funds for Israel, Taiwan and U.S. border security.

The Pentagon announced Tuesday it will rush about $300 million in weapons to Ukraine after finding some cost savings in its contracts. It’s the Biden administration's first announced security package for Ukraine since December, when it acknowledged it was out of replenishment funds.

Biden said the funding is not nearly enough, and pointed to Poland's own history to argue for further further funding.

“We must act before it literally is too late.” Biden said. “Because as Poland remembers, Russia won’t stop at Ukraine. Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States and the entire free world at risk.”

Duda met with U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday before the White House meeting. and offered a blunt warning: If the U.S. does not deliver military aid to halt Russia’s advance, Poland will be on the frontlines of a conflict that involves European and American troops.

“Financial support for Ukraine is cheap if you take into account what other forms of support would be needed if it comes to war and to an attack on NATO countries,” Duda said.

Tusk after the White House meeting called on Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to pass Ukraine funding, warning him that inaction could “cost thousands of human lives in Ukraine.”

“This is not some political skirmish that has significance only here, on the American political stage,” Tusk said.

Johnson, who was among the lawmakers who met with Duda, said in a statement, that “America must remain united with our friends against those who threaten our security.”

Biden informed the leaders that the U.S. plans to move forward with a foreign military financing loan that will help Poland purchase 96 Apache helicopters. The State Department approved the sale last year.

The visit offered Biden another opportunity to showcase how his view of NATO contrasts with that of the likely 2024 Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.

Trump has said that when he was president, he warned NATO allies that he “would encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to countries that are “delinquent” in meeting the alliance's defense spending target. White House press secretary

Fear is deepening across Europe about Ukraine's fate as its ammunition stocks run low and as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in Ukraine, reversing its weak military performance at the start of a war launched in February 2022.

Tusk said that despite political divisions in Poland the country is unified on the issues of security, Russia and Ukraine and wishes the same were true for other allies.

“When we Poles started on our road to the West, Pope John Paul II said there could be no just Europe without an independent Poland,” Tusk said “And today, I would say there can be no safe Europe without a strong Poland. And of course I would also say there could be no just Europe without a free and independent Ukraine.”

It is the first time in a quarter-century for a Polish president and prime minister to be in Washington at the same time and the first for both leaders to be welcomed at the White House at the same time, according to Polish media. The gesture by the bitter political rivals is widely seen as an acknowledgment of the seriousness of this historical moment, with Russian strength growing as that of Ukraine wanes.

Duda, aligned with a national conservative party that lost power last year, used his power to delay the transition to a new government under Tusk by weeks.

Tusk won power after promising to restore democratic norms that eroded under the last government and Poland has been hailed by many across Europe as one of the only places where growing authoritarianism has been reversed in recent times.

“No matter matter who wins the election in our country we treat our obligation seriously, more than anyone else in Europe,” Tusk said.

Syria, Turkey sign military agreement","Syrian officials concluded a visit to Turkey yesterday, where the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on military training and consultation.

State news agency Sana reported yesterday that Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani, Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra, and intelligence chief Hussein Salameh had held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

Following the meeting, Shibani outlined the ""need for security and military coordination to control borders and combat terrorism"".

The Enab Baladi website said that the military agreement would focus on developing the capacities of the Syrian army and supporting security reforms. This included ""specialised skills training"" and technical assistance.

It also reported that the two sides had ""threatened to escalate"" with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in north-east Syria after negotiations had ""faltered"".

'Significant escalation' in north-east Syria

Coinciding with the talks in Ankara, Syrian media have reported clashes in north-east Syria between the SDF and forces affiliated to the Syrian army.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported early this morning a ""significant escalation"" on the ground between the SDF and ""Turkey-backed factions"" affiliated to the defence ministry, with the two sides sending ""military reinforcements"" to the eastern Aleppo province and eastern Raqqa.

Meanwhile, the pro-government Syria TV reported clashes between the Syrian army and the SDF in the city of Deir al-Zour, as well as ""violent clashes"" between Arab tribes and the SDF in the east of the province.

It said that the clashes had erupted after SDF fighters had targeted a Syrian army post, and that they had involved ""machine guns and rockets"".

According to a Syria TV correspondent, tribal fighters captured four SDF members during the fighting.

Lebanese media divided over Larijani's visit

Lebanon's media have provided contrasting coverage of Iranian Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Larijani's visit to Beirut, following his arrival yesterday, and his meetings with Lebanese officials.

State news agency NNA highlighted remarks Prime Minister Nawaf Salam made during a meeting with Larijani, describing recent Iranian statements on Hezbollah's disarmament as ""unacceptable"" and a ""violation"" of Lebanese sovereignty.

The L'Orient-Le Jour daily commented that ""Larijani had defied Beirut's will"".

The anti-Hezbollah MTV outlet similarly viewed Larijani's visit as an attempt to ""prevent the implementation"" of the US proposal on disarmament.

Meanwhile, the pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar daily accused the Lebanese leadership of attempting to ""derail the visit"", commenting that Larijani had come ""in support"" of Lebanon. It said that Larijani had arrived in Beirut ""smiling, unarmed, to a popular reception"".

Hamas condemns Netanyahu's 'Greater Israel' remarks

Hamas released a statement yesterday condemning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks in which he said he was ""very"" connected to the vision of Greater Israel, describing his comments as ""satanic and criminal"" and warning against Israel's ""expansionist plans"".

In an interview with the Israeli i24 News on 12 August, Netanyahu said he felt that he was on a ""historic and spiritual mission"". When asked if he felt connected to the vision of Greater Israel, referring to Israel and the areas it conquered after the 1967 war including the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights, Netanyahu said ""very"".

The prime minister's remarks drew wide backlash from other Palestinian factions, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).

Netanyahu's remarks draw wide Arab condemnation

The remarks also sparked wide condemnation from Arab countries including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in addition to the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Jordan described the remarks as a ""dangerous and provocative escalation"", warning they pose a direct threat to regional sovereignty. Meanwhile, the Saudi foreign ministry said it completely rejected the ""settlement and expansionist ideas and projects"" adopted by Israeli authorities. For its part, Egypt demanded ""clarifications"", noting that the remarks reflected ""rejection of the peace option in the region and insistence on escalation"", while Qatar described them as ""an extension of the occupation's approach based on arrogance"".

The Arab League said in a statement that Netanyahu's remarks were ""a violation of the sovereignty of Arab states and an attempt to undermine security and stability in the region"", while the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council said the remarks  were a ""flagrant violation of international law, as well as a blatant attack on the sovereignty of states and the unity of their lands"".

Turkey reportedly pressures Hamas to disarm

Unnamed Palestinian sources have told the Israeli daily Haaretz that Turkey has signalled to Hamas officials that they must comply with demands to disarm and relinquish power as efforts to reach a ceasefire deal continue.

In a report published yesterday, Haaretz noted that Qatar is expressing a similar position.

""Hamas feels the political isolation and this forces them to understand that they have no ability to entrench themselves in their demand to continue to possess weapons and government institutions,"" the source said.

Meanwhile, Israeli army Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir approved yesterday the government's plan to occupy Gaza City despite his opposition to the operation, the public broadcaster Kan reported. Kan said the army will soon begin mass evacuations for Gaza City, where at least 800,000 Palestinians are currently located.

Hamas, Egypt spy chief discuss Gaza truce

A Hamas delegation led by Khalil al-Hayya, the group's Gaza leader, held talks in Cairo yesterday with Egypt's intelligence chief in an attempt to revive the stalled Gaza ceasefire talks.

The state-run Al-Qahera News TV quoted an official source as saying that Hamas had expressed its willingness to resume ceasefire negotiations as Egypt intensifies its contacts with all parties to secure a 60-day temporary truce.

Egypt trains Palestinian officers to deploy in post-war Gaza

Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty has said Egypt has begun training Palestinian police officers, in cooperation with Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (PA), to be deployed in post-war Gaza.

In an interview with the privately owned DMC TV yesterday, Abdelatty said about 5,000 police officers will be trained, adding that such move as well as the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip will be under the auspices of the Palestinian prime minister, who will attend an International Conference for the Reconstruction of Gaza scheduled to be held in Cairo after reaching a ceasefire agreement.

He reiterated that the PA will administer the Gaza Strip through a 15-member panel of Palestinian technocrats who do not belong to any faction.

Wildfires rage in western Syria

Syrian media have reported major wildfires in the provinces of Latakia and Hama during the past two days.

The SOHR reported yesterday that ongoing wildfires in Syria's coastal mountain range ""devoured vast areas of forest and woodland"".

It added that the mountainous terrain had made it harder for firefighters to respond to the fires, and that the area was witnessing ""growing public discontent"" over the limited official response. The SOHR also noted that some had accused ""influential figures"" in the new government of deliberately starting the fires.

Separately, the SOHR published a video of the fires, warning that ""any delay in intervention could cause a real catastrophe"".

The pro-government Zaman al-Wasl website reported yesterday that six ""major"" forest fires had forced ""residents to flee as the flames approached their homes""."
NYTF000020240313ek3d0003w,"Biden Reiterates 'Ironclad' Support for U.S. Allies in NATO, Defying Russia (and Trump)","The president hosted leaders of Poland at the White House as he sought to reassure NATO members of American steadfastness in the face of threats from Moscow and former President Donald J. Trump.

President Biden pledged an ''ironclad'' commitment to America's allies on Tuesday as he sought to reassure NATO members that the United States would not abandon its international obligations despite the threats of aggression by Russia and disruption by his all-but-certain fall election rival, former President Donald J. Trump.","Hosting the leaders of Poland at the White House, Mr. Biden made a show of defiance not only against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who continues to wage war on Ukraine, but also, implicitly at least, against Mr. Trump, who has said he would ''encourage'' Russia to attack NATO members that do not spend enough on their militaries.

''When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,'' Mr. Biden said, citing former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Czech-born diplomat who championed NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and her homeland, finalized on this day in 1999 with the support of Mr. Biden, then a senator. ''I believed that then, and I believe it now,'' he added.

The meeting with President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland marked the 25th anniversary of their country's accession to NATO, which was the beginning of a quarter-century post-Cold War expansion of the alliance into parts of Europe previously dominated by the old Soviet Union. Just this month, NATO formally welcomed Sweden, which like Finland joined in response to Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022, increasing the alliance to 32 members, up from 16 when the Berlin Wall fell.

Mr. Biden used the occasion to announce $300 million in additional weapons and military equipment for Ukraine, a small fraction of what he has asked Congress for but all he could squeeze out of savings from previous arms transfers without additional legislative authority. He pressed House Republican leaders to stop blocking legislation passed by the Senate for $60 billion in security aid to Ukraine, a measure that has bipartisan support and would almost surely pass if brought to the floor.

''We must act before it literally is too late, before it's too late, because as Poland remembers, Russia won't stop at Ukraine,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States and the entire free world at risk.''

Mr. Biden praised the Polish leaders not only for investing in the alliance but also for taking in about one million Ukrainians who have fled the war. ''You're doing God's work,'' he told the leaders. ''You really are. It's incredible what you're doing, what the Polish people are doing.''

He also promised Poland a $2 billion military loan and approved the sale of 96 Apache attack helicopters to Warsaw.

Poland sits on the frontline of the alliance, perpetually wary of Russian revanchism and staunchly supportive of Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, as it defends itself against Mr. Putin's forces. Poland spends more on its military as a proportion than any other member of the alliance, nearly 4 percent of its economy, twice the alliance's goal. Mr. Duda used the White House visit to propose that NATO increase its target from 2 percent of gross domestic product to 3 percent.

''Other allies must take more responsibility for the security of the alliance as a whole,'' Mr. Duda said as he sat with Mr. Biden in the East Room of the White House. ''Two percent was good 10 years ago. Now 3 percent is required in response to the full-scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO's eastern border.''

The alliance's leaders agreed in 2014 to the 2 percent goal, but it was a nonbinding aspiration to meet by 2024. While several American presidents have pushed NATO to do more for its own defense, Mr. Trump was more bellicose in demanding that allies raise their military spending and spoke of it as if they owed the money to the United States, which was not true.

Under Mr. Trump, the number of NATO members meeting the 2 percent goal increased to nine from six. Under Mr. Biden, it has doubled to 18, reflecting rising fear of Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The United States spends 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, and most of the other top spenders are in Eastern Europe, closer to Russia. Collectively, the European allies are spending 2 percent of their combined gross domestic product this year, or $380 billion.

While Mr. Biden did not mention Mr. Trump by name on Tuesday, Mr. Tusk seemed to allude to comments in which the former president scoffed at the mutual defense obligation in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. ''We treat our obligations seriously, more than anyone else in Europe,'' Mr. Tusk said. ''And we hope that none of our NATO partners will undermine the most important obligation, which is Article 5 of the treaty.''

The visit by the Polish leaders was the first since a landmark election in October, when opposition parties defeated the ruling Law and Justice party, a right-wing faction accused of subverting democracy as it consolidated power over major institutions like the judiciary, the news media, the central bank and large state-controlled corporations.

Mr. Duda and Mr. Tusk, who was installed in December as prime minister, are fierce rivals who have clashed repeatedly at home. Mr. Duda is an ally of Law and Justice who curried favor with Mr. Trump when he was in office, while Mr. Tusk is a veteran centrist who during a previous stint as prime minister from 2007 to 2014 worked with Mr. Biden, then the vice president.

Their conflict led to a dramatic showdown in January when Mr. Duda gave shelter in the presidential palace to two former officials from his party previously convicted of abuse of power. Mr. Tusk accused Mr. Duda of obstruction of justice, and the police were sent into the palace to arrest the former officials.

But in a measure of how seriously Poland takes the Russian threat, the two rivals agreed to put aside their differences for their joint visit with Mr. Biden. ''I differ politically with President Andrzej Duda on almost everything,'' Mr. Tusk wrote in Polish on social media, ''but when it comes to the security of our homeland, we must and will act together. Not only during a visit to the USA.''"
NYTF000020240313ek3d0003u,U.S. Cobbles Together $300 Million for a Weapons Shipment to a Depleted Ukraine,"The package will keep advancing Russian troops at bay for only a few weeks, an official said.

The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it was sending up to $300 million in weapons to Ukraine, the first new aid package for the country since funding ran out in late December.","The package, pulled together from money that Army accountants cobbled from savings from contracts that came in under bid, includes air defense interceptors, artillery rounds and armor systems, senior defense officials said. Two U.S. officials said the package also includes an older version of the Army's longer-range missile systems known as ATACMS, which can travel 100 miles.

It is a stopgap measure at best, the officials said, but Ukraine is in dire need of air defense systems in particular, as Russia has continued its bombardment of towns particularly in the east.

The makeshift solution would keep advancing Russian troops at bay for only a few weeks, one official said.

Announcing the aid package at the White House, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that ''Ukrainian troops have fought bravely, are fighting bravely throughout this war, but they are now forced to ration their ammunition under pressure on multiple fronts.''

He said the new package would ''keep Ukraine's guns firing for a period, but only a short period.'' Mr. Sullivan called for Congress to pass a new Ukraine aid bill ''as soon as possible.''

He said that Ukraine desperately needed the assistance to hold the line against Russian attacks, but that ''it goes without saying this package does not displace and should not delay the critical need to pass the bipartisan national security bill.''

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his overnight address, thanked ''the United States and all Americans who value freedom'' for their support of his country.

The Senate passed an emergency aid bill including $60.1 billion for Ukraine. But the measure faces an uncertain fate in the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders have refused to put the measure to a vote. While congressional officials say there is a critical mass of support for continuing to arm Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, the Republican Party is increasingly turning away from its traditional hawkish posture and belief in projecting American power and democratic principles around the world.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican of Louisiana who has opposed aiding Ukraine, must navigate a handful of ultraconservative lawmakers who have said they will move to oust him if he allows a vote on Ukraine aid without stringent immigration measures attached.

On Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, urged Mr. Johnson to hold a vote on the Ukraine aid package.

''I want to encourage the speaker again to allow a vote,'' he said.

For President Biden, who has led the way in calling for the West to stand up for Ukraine against Russia's invasion and occupation, the issue has become an embarrassing one on the international stage.

The American political paralysis has led, Pentagon officials said, to critical shortages on the battlefields of Ukraine. As each day goes by without a fresh supply of munitions and artillery, and Ukrainian crews ration the shells they have, morale suffers.

''When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back; that's costing terrain,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''It's costing lives and it's costing us, the United States and the NATO alliance, strategically.''

Since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has sent more than $75 billion in cash and equipment to the country for its defense. Most of the aid has gone to Ukraine's military operations, keeping its government running and addressing its humanitarian needs.

The money ran out in December, and Mr. Biden asked Congress for the authority to begin a new infusion of cash and equipment that only it can approve. But many Republicans object to pouring more taxpayer dollars into the conflict.

Senior intelligence officials warned on Monday that without additional American aid, Ukraine faced the prospect of continued battlefield losses as Russia uses a network of arms suppliers and increases its supply of technology from China.

In public testimony during the annual survey of worldwide threats facing the United States, the officials told Congress that any continued delay of U.S. aid would lead to additional territorial gains by Russia over the next year, the consequences of which would be felt in Europe and in the Pacific.

On Tuesday, Denmark also announced a new $340 million military aid package for Ukraine.

NYTF000020240329ek3t0003w,Taiwan Envoy Urges U.S. Aid to Ukraine,"Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said in an interview that a Russian victory could embolden China to move against Taiwan and would fuel anti-American propaganda.

Joseph Wu, the foreign minister of Taiwan, said on Thursday that a halt in U.S. arms shipments to Ukraine would embolden China in its aggressions against Taiwan and fuel propaganda from Beijing that the United States is an unreliable partner.","''When people ask us whether it is OK for the United States to abandon Ukraine, the answer is no, because the world is operating not in a black-and-white way, or if you only look at one theater at a time,'' he said. ''The world is interconnected.''

If Russia is able to occupy more of Ukraine and claim victory, he added, ''it would be seen as a victory of authoritarian states because Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, they are now linked together.''

Mr. Wu's comments, made in a wide-ranging hourlong interview in Taipei, come as the Biden administration tries to get Congress to pass a supplemental funding package that would give $60 billion of aid to Ukraine.

Many House Republicans are staunchly opposed to giving more aid to Ukraine, adopting the ''America First'' posture embraced by former President Donald J. Trump, a pro-Russia candidate who has pressed them to reject the package. For months they claimed they would be willing to consider providing more assistance for Kyiv if the Biden administration imposed severe immigration restrictions at the United States border with Mexico. But at Mr. Trump's urging, they balked at a funding package that would have done that, calling the border measures too weak.

The package also includes $8 billion of aid to counter China in the Asia-Pacific region, $1.9 billion of which would refill stocks of U.S. weapons sent to Taiwan. And it includes $14.1 billion of military aid to Israel.

Some Republican lawmakers contend that China is a bigger threat than Russia and that the funding proposed for Ukraine should go toward countering China. But other Republican officials in Congress and many Democrats make the same argument as Mr. Wu: that Taiwan's security is linked to that of Ukraine, because China will see weakness on the part of the United States -- and a greater chance of success in a potential invasion of Taiwan -- if Ukraine is defeated.

Chinese leaders have said for decades that Taiwan, a de facto independent island, must be brought under the rule of the Communist Party, by force if necessary. Xi Jinping, China's leader, has continued to promote that position.

The U.S. and Taiwanese governments have been trying to deter China from notions of invading Taiwan, including through military buildup in the region and bolstering alliances with other democratic nations.

If the United States abandons Ukraine, Mr. Wu said, China will ''take it as a hint'' that if it can keep up sustained action against Taiwan, ''the United States is going to back off, the United States and its allies are going to back off.'' The thinking among Chinese officials would be this, he said: ''OK, since Russia could do that, we can do that as well.''

''So the U.S. determination in providing support to those countries suffering from authoritarian aggression, it is very important,'' Mr. Wu said.

After U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, China pushed propaganda through traditional state-run media and social media that ''the U.S. commitment to anything is not firm,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We suffered from a huge wave of cognitive warfare.''

China has also spread disinformation stressing Russian narratives of the war, Mr. Wu said, including the idea that the expansion of NATO forced President Vladimir V. Putin to attack Ukraine, and that the United States is ultimately not committed to supporting Ukraine.

On the eve of Russia's invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, and their two governments announced a ''no limits'' partnership.

Mr. Wu said some Central and Eastern European nations seeking to forge anti-authoritarian partnerships had strengthened their relations with Taiwan during the war.

His comments on the need for the United States to keep supporting Taiwan echo those of other senior Taiwanese officials. In May 2023, Bi-khim Hsiao, then Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United States and now the incoming vice president, made similar arguments to reporters in Washington.

And in February, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said during a visit of American lawmakers to Taiwan that the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the president-elect, Lai Ching-te, made clear to the lawmakers that ''if for some reason the Ukrainians do not prevail, that will only encourage hostilities against Taiwan.''"
NYTF000020240326ek3q00040,Speaker Wants to Aid Ukraine. The Obstacle Is His Own Party.,"The Republican speaker, with his job on the line, has privately told people he would make sure the House moves to assist Ukraine, a step that many members of his party oppose.

When Speaker Mike Johnson opened the floor for questions at a closed-door luncheon fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, Jacquie Colgan asked how, in the face of vehement opposition within his own ranks, he planned to handle aid for Ukraine.","What followed was an impassioned monologue by Mr. Johnson in which he explained why continued American aid to Kyiv was, in his view, vital -- a message starkly at odds with the hard-right views that have overtaken his party. He invoked his political roots as a Reagan Republican, denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a ''madman'' and conceded the issue had forced him to walk a ''delicate political tightrope.''

Reminded by Ms. Colgan, a member of the American Coalition for Ukraine, a nonprofit advocacy group, of the adage that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was for good people to do nothing, Mr. Johnson replied that he kept a copy of the quotation framed in his office.

''That's not going to be us,'' he assured her. ''We're going to do our job.''

The exchange reflects what Mr. Johnson has privately told donors, foreign leaders and fellow members of Congress in recent weeks, according to extensive notes Ms. Colgan took during the New Jersey event and interviews with several other people who have spoken with him.

While the speaker has remained noncommittal about any one option, he has repeatedly expressed a personal desire to send aid to Ukraine -- something he has voted against repeatedly in the past -- and now appears to be in search of the least politically damaging way to do it.

The challenge for Mr. Johnson is that any combination of aid measures he puts to a vote will likely infuriate the growing isolationist wing of his party, which considers the issue toxic. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who has repeatedly said she would call a snap vote to unseat the speaker if he allowed a vote for Ukraine aid before imposing restrictive immigration measures, filed a resolution on Friday calling for his removal, saying she wanted to send him ''a warning.''

Even if Ms. Greene follows through on the threat, Mr. Johnson could still hold onto his job. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, has said he believed ''a reasonable number'' of Democrats would vote to save the speaker were he to face a Republican mutiny for acting on the Senate-passed aid package, though on Friday Mr. Jeffries said that had been ''an observation, not a declaration.''

In a lengthy statement on Friday after Ms. Greene had filed her resolution and the House departed Washington for its Easter recess, Mr. Johnson said that when lawmakers returned in two weeks, they would ''take the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request.''

''We have done important work discussing options with members,'' he said, ''and are preparing to complete our plan for action.''

Privately, Mr. Johnson has expressed an interest in linking Ukraine aid to a measure aimed at forcing the Biden administration to reverse its moratorium on liquid natural gas exports, according to three people familiar with his deliberations who were not authorized to discuss them. Mr. Johnson pressed the issue at a White House meeting last month with President Biden and congressional leaders, arguing that by prohibiting new exports of domestic energy, the administration was increasing reliance on Russian gas, effectively enriching Ukraine's enemy.

In that meeting, according to a person familiar with the comments, Mr. Johnson raised the case of Calcasieu Pass 2, a proposed export terminal that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles, La., and would dwarf the country's existing export terminals. The Biden administration in January had paused a decision on whether to approve it.

He has puzzled over whether to put the aid to a vote on the House floor packaged with assistance for other U.S. allies, including Israel and Taiwan, or allow lawmakers to vote on them separately to register their support for each individual nation.

With many Republicans bent on blocking aid to Ukraine, any legislation carrying it would need to be considered using a special procedure that bypasses House rules and requires a two-thirds majority for passage, relying heavily on votes from Democrats. But a combined aid package for both Ukraine and Israel like the one that passed the Senate last month could be doomed by a coalition of right-wing Republicans opposing the money for Kyiv and left-wing Democrats opposing aid for Israel.

Mr. Johnson has pondered imposing new sanctions against Russia. And he has debated how the money should be structured -- straight assistance versus a loan -- and whether it should be exclusively for lethal aid, a type of assistance that is more widely supported by his conference, or also include nonmilitary assistance.

''There is a big distinction in the minds of a lot of people between lethal aid for Ukraine, and the humanitarian component,'' Mr. Johnson said at a news conference at the Capitol last week.

Both he and Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have publicly floated the idea of paying for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen using legislation called the REPO Act.

Mr. Johnson has faced mounting international pressure to allow a vote on aid to Ukraine, fielding almost weekly visits and calls from NATO allies and pro-Ukraine activists both at his offices in Washington and Louisiana. When Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland visited Washington earlier this month, he had a sharp public message for the speaker.

''This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,'' Mr. Tusk told reporters. ''The absence of this positive decision of Mr. Johnson will really cost thousands of lives there -- children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.''

Meeting privately with Mr. Johnson in his office in the Capitol, President Andrzej Duda of Poland appealed to the Louisiana Republican's respect for President Ronald Reagan, whose portrait hung beside the speaker during the meeting. Mr. Duda quoted Mr. Reagan extensively and praised his willingness to call out good versus evil during the Cold War, according to a person familiar with the comments who requested anonymity to describe them.

Some skeptical Ukraine backers, both on and off Capitol Hill, have fretted that Mr. Johnson's agreeable comments have simply reflected his penchant for telling people what they want to hear. Early in Mr. Johnson's tenure as speaker, lawmakers noticed that he had a habit of leaving listeners from warring factions with the impression he agreed with each of them.

Yet at the fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, he was fairly candid about his calculations.

Mr. Johnson told the audience that he was ''working to figure out the best route forward,'' Ms. Colgan recalled, adding that he said that half of House Republicans wanted to move it together as a package with Israel and Taiwan, and the other half wanted to do it on its own.

At a separate fund-raiser in Binghamton for a congressman in New York's Hudson Valley last month, Christina Zawerucha, the executive director of the Together for Ukraine Foundation, and Anatoliy Pradun, the group's president, who was born and raised in Ukraine, approached the speaker to press him on holding a vote.

Mr. Pradun had hoped to appeal to Mr. Johnson's faith by telling him of the strong evangelical Christian community in Ukraine. But realizing they had little time to make their case, Ms. Zawerucha and Mr. Pradun instead gave the speaker a pin with the Ukrainian and American flags, showed him their poster advertising an upcoming interfaith vigil for Ukraine and implored him to schedule a vote on aid to Kyiv.

''He didn't turn us away,'' Ms. Zawerucha said. ''He pointed at our poster and said, 'I will take care of this. I will take care of this.'''

When Ms. Zawerucha relayed the interaction to fellow activists after the luncheon, they asked what she thought he meant.

''And at this point, I don't know,'' she said. ''It's been over a month since Speaker Johnson said he would take care of this. And a vote for Ukraine still has not been allowed on the floor.''

Tallinn, 8 March: On Thursday, an Estonian officer, Lt. Cmdr. Kristjan Peegel, who had completed his rotation in the military operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq, was awarded the United States secretary of defense's Joint Service Commendation Medal for his exemplary service.","Peegel served for more than seven months at the Erbil Airbase as head of the military advisory group's planning department as part of the US-led international military operation Inherent Resolve. Upon completing his rotation, Peegel was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal, issued by the US secretary of defense and signed by the commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, for exemplary service.

The medal was presented by Col. Thurman McKenzie, the commander of the military advisory group stationed at Erbil Airbase and Peegel's direct superior.

""I thank you for your significant contribution and perseverance in successfully fulfilling critical tasks,"" McKenzie said, adding that he highly values Peegel's dedication and unwavering character. ""I will miss our exciting conversations,"" he noted.

BBCEUP0020240306ek36000b5,Latvia earmarks 303m euros for eastern border anti-mobility plan,"Text of report in English by Latvian news agency LETA on 5 March

Riga, March 5 (LETA) - The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved the plan for military reinforcement and anti-mobility of the eastern border, the implementation of which is planned to cost EUR 303 million, the Press Department of the Defence Ministry informed the LETA.","The eastern border military reinforcement and anti-mobility plan is part of the establishment of the Baltic Defence Line, which will include the creation of support points for National Armed Forces units along the entire Russian-Belarusian border - defensive positions for soldiers and fortified defence positions, various obstacles, anti-tank ditches, ammunition and mine depots.

Over the next five years, the defence sector will invest EUR 303 million in strengthening the border. The work for which this funding is earmarked will start in March.

To prevent enemy movement, border reinforcement in Latvia will start with the excavation of existing roads to create anti-tank ditches, while later drainage ditches along the border will also be converted into anti-tank ditches.

Various types of barriers will also be formed, such as reinforcement of anti-tank ditches with concrete blocks and structures such as 'dragon's teeth' and anti-tank mines. The placement of obstacles will also be adapted to the terrain, using natural obstacles such as marshes, forests and other natural features.

At the same time, secure storage facilities for explosives, mines and engineering material will be identified and established in the border area for rapid reinforcement of defensive positions. Plans will also be developed to prepare the most important transport arteries - roads, railways, bridges - for rapid and effective crossing to delay possible enemy advances.

As reported, in January this year the Defence Ministers of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia signed an agreement on the establishment of a Baltic Defence Line to strengthen the eastern border of the Baltic states and NATO. The Baltic Defence Line will be built in a coordinated manner, but each country will do so with its own budget.

The Baltic Defence Line will significantly strengthen the Baltic countries' ability to militarily defend their borders and deter Russia's ability to conduct rapid military operations. The construction of the line corresponds NATO defence plans.

""The Michigan National Guard has been an indispensable partner to the National Armed Forces for more than 30 years.

BBCEUP0020240306ek36000gp,Latvia says Russian military assets near border down significantly,"Text of report in English by Latvian news agency LETA on 6 March

RIGA, March 6 (LETA) - Russia, in an attempt to maintain its current military capability and momentum for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has already significantly reduced its personnel and weapons in the vicinity of the Latvian border, thus leaving Russia with insufficient military capacity and resources to launch a conventional attack against a NATO member state, according to a statement issued by the National Armed Forces (NBS).","Therefore, the NBS calls for a critical assessment of the tendentious speculations from various sources in the information space about a possible increase of the threat in Europe, including Latvia.

The NBS also calls on the public not to share these messages in order not to support the Russian propaganda machine in its attempts to sow fear about a possible Russian attack on Latvia or another NATO member state.

The NBS also points out that Russia's military failure to prevail and the huge loss of resources in the more than two years of fighting in Ukraine are a sign of its systemic weakness and stagnation at all levels of its command. Moreover, for Russia to attack a NATO member state, a number of preconditions must be met and a specific situation must be created. The NBS therefore draws attention to the fact that such preconditions do not exist for Russian aggression against NATO members.

The NBS reminds that Latvia has been a member of the world's strongest alliance for almost 20 years. An attack on Latvia would mean an attack on all member states, followed by an immediate response from NATO.

Recently, populist speculations about the inability of the NBS to defend the country have been expressed in the Latvian information space by various Latvian and foreign voices. Therefore, the NBS calls on the public to maintain a cool head, not to share or amplify such messages - especially those disseminated by persons who are no longer serving in the armed forces, or who have not been involved in the defence sector at all. By sharing questionable messages, these individuals are unwittingly or knowingly doing a service to Russia's aggressive propaganda messages.

""We, soldiers and servicemen, do not take peace for granted. Like the Lithuanians and Estonians and the soldiers of other NATO member states, we prepare for war every day so that it does not happen. This is our chosen vocation and duty towards Latvia and our responsibility for every resident of our country. Instead of propagating populist posts on social media, we invite everyone to strengthen national security by joining the National Guard, the National Defence Service, or by learning basic military skills in the Volunteer Reservist Course,"" reads the NBS statement.

In conclusion, the NBS underlines that the security situation in Latvia is as stable and comparable to the security situation in other NATO member states not bordering Russia, such as Spain, France or Italy.

Vilnius, 1 March: Polish laws do not set out an obligation to send troops to Lithuania in case of an attack there, says Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte. Her statement comes amid a stir caused by a US retired general, who said last week the Polish army would not come to Lithuania&#8217;s aid in the worst-case scenario.","&#8220;The law does not impose such an obligation,&#8221; the prime minister told TV3 Friday when asked whether Poland has legislation in place to prevent Polish troops from being deployed in Lithuania, a NATO ally, in case of an attack.

&#8220;I am aware of certain legal restrictions that do exist in Poland. This is not about a political decision at all levels or something. There are very clear legal restrictions. To my mind, this is a problem that needs to be discussed at all levels,&#8221; the prime minister said.

This issue must be raised at bilateral formats with Polish leaders, according to Simonyte.

&#8220;A solution needs to be found that allows fitting into Polish legislation. On the other hand, since Poland is a NATO country, and NATO is a collective defence alliance, and an attack on one country means an attack on all, this contradiction between, let us say, international obligations and domestic legislation needs to be addressed,&#8221; the prime minister stated.

Lithuania must be ready to defend itself for at least two weeks in the event of a Russian attack, Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of US Army Europe, told the Vilnius Security Forum last week.

NATO&#8217;s Article 5 guarantees are not automatic as it needs political will to be activated, he said. This means that Lithuania must be prepared to stand its ground until allied reinforcements arrive.

According to the president, Poland is directly involved in bolstering the security of the Baltic region, actively participates in NATO's Baltic air policing mission and takes part in joint military exercises.

""I am confident that we will continue to strengthen our partnership through security initiatives, as well as through the joint development of the defence industry,"" he said.

Nauseda and Duda observed allied forces' joint operation of crossing the Vistula River.

Dragon 2024 is part of NATO's Steadfast Defender 24, the largest NATO exercise in Europe since the Cold War.

The exercise in Poland ""will certify Allied forces for deterrence and defence tasks, prepare for a potential aggression against NATO Allies and executive combat actions across land, air and maritime domains"", the Lithuanian Armed Forces have said in a press release.

""The centerpiece operation of Dragon 24 is deployment of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force in assistance to an Ally in the event of aggression which will also highlight the nuances and potential challenges of military mobility across national borders,"" the military said.

After Turkey&#8217;s and Hungary&#8217;s long delays, Sweden will now become a Nato member. According to experts, this will facilitate the planning of Baltic Sea security, but may also leave the Baltic states on the border of two commands.","Sweden&#8217;s accession to Nato is like the last piece of the puzzle that will turn the Baltic Sea region into one whole picture.

""It means a faster exchange of information. It also means that it will be easier to plan with them. If we look at the geographical map, it is clear that there will be no gaps in the Baltic states, that we know that Sweden is with us from the start,"" said colonel Eero Rebo, chief of the Defence League&#8217;s [voluntary arm of Estonian Defence Forces] General Staff.

""In this context the Gotland island is very important, which in principle is a big lock of the Baltic Sea. Somewhat similar to what Iceland is for the Atlantic, hence strategically very important,"" noted Margus Kolga, former Estonian ambassador to Sweden.

Sweden has a strong navy with long-lasting traditions, which can skilfully operate on the Baltic Sea. Its submarines are also important.

""Militarily, submarines are a hidden resource or hidden capability. Those who have them can conduct operations with other, significantly more comprehensive methods than others,"" said Kolga.

Sweden&#8217;s navy has been specifically developed for operation in the Baltic Sea region. The submarines are therefore smaller, they have never been designed for operation in the North Atlantic, for example,"" said security expert Martin Hurt.

There has been much talk about the strength of Sweden&#8217;s navy, but they have also other capabilities.

""Certainly one key capability is air superiority. To my knowledge, Sweden has 120 Gripen fighter aircraft, which is a very, very potent military force,"" Kolga said.

""Sweden&#8217;s airports will increase options. Also, all kind of dispersion of aircraft is good and this allows to add depth to our defence activities,"" Rebo said.

Sweden also contributes to Nato with advance warning systems. They also have significant intelligence capability and defence industry.

""Sweden is allegedly one of the few European states that produces military platforms in all military dimensions and for all weapon types. There are supposedly only four such states in Europe. Besides Sweden, also the United Kingdom, France and Germany. These are also historically very deep and long-term and technologically advanced solutions,"" Kolga said.

But Sweden&#8217;s land force has decreased in the past decade. According to Hurt, after the Cold War it focused on expedition forces and field operations.

""When Sweden&#8217;s defence forces began to be strengthened after Crimea&#8217;s occupation in 2014 and the start of Russia&#8217;s aggression against Ukraine, then clearly too little money was allocated for that, hence this defence capability is certainly in a developmental stage,"" he said.

""If we look at Sweden&#8217;s 12-billion annual budget then this allows them develop very fast in the future. Especially because they have in industrial base,"" Rebo noted.

Even though Nato&#8217;s Baltic Sea puzzle is now ready, there is still the outstanding question of how well various pieces fit together. The military command and planning of the alliance has been divided between different joint force commands. Denmark and Finland are under Brunssum in the Netherlands, while Norway is under US-based Norfolk. Now Sweden is also looking to the USA. This has led to a fear that the Baltic states will remain on the border of two commands and planning.

""Sweden is partly a Baltic Sea state but partly also an Arctic state and it is looking towards the north, and historically has always done so. Sweden has somewhat different interests than Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The decisions about where those borders will be drawn between different Nato joint force commands, have not been made yet,"" said Hurt.

This border is an imaginary border, which can be coordinated and about which either additional plans can be developed, or partial plans with which Sweden can also support the Baltic states,"" Rebo said.

According to Rebo, it is obvious that with Sweden&#8217;s membership, Nato&#8217;s defence activities will become more effective and that this will also reduce the Russian threat.

""If we speak about Kaliningrad, then from the Russian perspective their chances of success on the sea and in skies will decrease, which means that the defence of the Suwalki gap will be an increasingly important issue for our southern neighbours,"" Rebo said.

""Supplying Kaliningrad is complicated already in peacetime, but in a time of war it will become even clearer that Sweden would not passively observe when Russia is trying to supply Kaliningrad,"" Hurt said.

According to Hurt, no military-technical revolution will take place in Sweden upon accession to Nato.

""Rather this is about changing the mindsets of people, which is important and will certainly take years. Until now, Sweden has gotten used to being outside alliances, which means that for a long time it has assumed that it will remain outside military conflicts,"" Hurt said.

Meanwhile, Tsakhna expressed the hope that the NATO Summit in Washington in July would lead to steps towards Ukraine becoming a NATO member.

""There is no more room for grey areas in Europe, so we hope that Ukraine will be admitted to the Alliance as soon as conditions allow,"" Tsakhna said.

Tsakhna stressed that Russia remains the most significant and long-term threat to the Alliance's security, as evidenced by its hybrid operations in the West, in addition to its aggression against Ukraine.

Videos of emaciated hostages ignite debate on Israel's war priorities","Israeli media discussed this morning the role of the Israeli government and some media outlets in the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages in captivity, following the release of videos by the military wings of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas showing the hostages suffering from severe malnutrition.

The Maariv daily reported that ""the families of the hostages, along with an entire nation, are watching their loved ones die before their eyes"". ""This is a terrible, disproportionate punishment inflicted upon us by Israel's criminally negligent government,"" it added.

The daily Haaretz criticised the media coverage, saying: ""Even in the face of videos proving that Israel's policy is killing the hostages, they continue to deny reality."" It added: ""Channel 14 skips over it, while Channel 12 babbles on, in both cases normalising the abandonment of the hostages for the most important goal of all: to keep crushing, dismantling, and destroying Gaza.""

The videos were released amidst Israeli media's consistent doubt of the extent of hunger in the Gaza Strip, calling it a ""false starvation campaign"".

Hamas says ready to deliver food aid to Israeli hostages

Hamas has said that it is ready to respond ""positively"" to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine aid to Israeli hostages.

""We stipulate that humanitarian corridors must be opened on a regular and permanent basis for the passage of food and medicine to all our people in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and that all forms of enemy air strikes must be halted at the time of receiving parcels for prisoners,"" Abu Ubaida, the spokesman of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, said in a Telegram statement yesterday.

This came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medicine to hostages.

Netanyahu made his request after videos of emaciated Israeli hostages were released by Hamas and the PIJ recently.

UAE airdrops more humanitarian aid to Gaza

The UAE has said it conducted its 61st airdrop of humanitarian aid in Gaza in coordination with Jordan.

This brings the total volume of humanitarian aid delivered by air to more than 3,818 tonnes of food and relief materials, directed toward supporting the most affected and vulnerable communities in Gaza, the UAE's official news agency Wam reported yesterday.

Moreover, the agency said that the UAE also facilitated the entry of 20 trucks loaded with food aid into Gaza yesterday.

The country said it also delivered 11 trucks carrying about 65 tonnes of medical supplies to Gaza in cooperation with the World Health Organisation, according to Wam.

Syrian security forces regain control of Suweida after clashes

A security source has said that Syrian Internal Security Forces (ISF) have regained control on areas in the southern restive province of Suweida (also Sweida) following clashes between government forces and Druze militants, state news agency Sana reported last night.

The ISF said that it regained control of the Tal al-Hadid, Rima Hazem and Walgha security checkpoints after five government personnel were reported killed following an attack by militants linked to the controversial Druze cleric Hikmat al-Hajri (also Hijri).

Sana said that ""Hajri's militias continued to violate the ceasefire agreement by launching treacherous attacks on internal security forces on several fronts, in addition to shelling some villages with rockets and mortar shells"".

The latest unrest follows the announcement of a ceasefire in southern Syria by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa last month following weeks of deadly violence.

Syria army, Kurdish force trade accusation over attacks in north

The Syrian defence ministry said that its forces carried out ""precision strikes"" targeting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after they shelled the village of Kayariyeh and its vicinity near Manbij in the northern province of Aleppo, state news agency Sana reported late on 2 August.

Earlier on the same day, Sana cited the ministry as saying that Syrian troops had repelled an attempted infiltration by the SDF into a military post near Kayariyeh, and also reported rocket launches by the SDF targeting residential homes in the village which injured four army personnel and three civilians.

Syrian Kurdish news agency ANHA reported that factions affiliated to the interim Syrian government launched attacks on the frontline with the SDF, chiefly in Deir Hafer.

The report said that ""unregulated"" groups affiliated to the government had shelled ""populated"" areas on the evening of 2 August, describing the attack as a ""dangerous military escalation"" and saying that the SDF had responded with heavy weaponry.

Over 50 migrants reported drowned, missing in boat capsize off Yemen

More that 50 migrants have been reported drowned and others missing following a boat capsize off the coast of Yemen's southern Abyan province due to bad weather, domestic media said yesterday.

Rescue teams recovered the bodies of 54 male and female irregular migrants, most of whom were Ethiopians, a health official in Zinjibar district was quoted by the privately owned Al-Masdar Online website as saying. The official said that rescue operations were still underway to try and recover the remaining bodies and that the boat was carrying around 150 people, the website reported.

In a Facebook post, the Abyan Security Department called on ""all relevant local and international parties to urgently intervene and take deterrent measures to halt the illegal flow [of migrants] through Yemeni territorial waters, which poses a growing humanitarian and security threat"".

Saudi Arabia, Palestinian groups condemn Ben Gvir's Al-Aqsa visit

Saudi Arabia issued a statement yesterday condemning the visit of Israeli government officials, including far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, describing such actions as ""provocative"". The site is referred to by Jews as Temple Mount.

The kingdom's foreign ministry warned that the visits of Israeli ""occupation"" officials to the site would further ""fuel conflict"" in the region, and called on the international community to intervene.

Pan-Arab media including Qatar's Al Jazeera TV reported that over 1,000 Israeli ""settlers stormed"" the compound early yesterday and noted that it was the highest number of Jewish visitors to visit to date and that police did not prevent them from performing prayers and ""Talmudic rituals"" and waving Israeli flags.

Palestinian factions also condemned Ben Gvir's visit to the compound as ""provocative"" and violating the site's status quo.

Lebanon marks fifth anniversary of Beirut port explosion

Lebanon is marking the fifth anniversary since the Beirut port explosion which killed some 235 people and injured thousands, domestic media reported.

After a two-year hiatus due to procedural appeals, the reopening of the domestic probe early this year ""offers hopes for answers"", with hearings finally resuming and with political guarantees by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam - former ICJ president, French-language daily L'Orient-Le Jour reported late last night.

Salam stressed the government's commitment to follow up on the case ""until justice is served"", telling families of the dead in a ceremony yesterday that ""we will not compromise on justice or the truth"".

He participated in the naming of a street close to Beirut port ""August 4th Victims Street"" following a request from relatives of the dead, in a ceremony attended by other ministers and Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud, the daily reported.

Vilnius, 5 March: President of Lithuania Gitanas Nauseda on Tuesday is paying a visit to Poland, where together with President of Poland Andrzej Duda he observed Polish-led military exercise Dragon 2024.","""Lithuania and Poland share common understanding of security threats. We will continue working together enhancing the security of our countries and NATO's entire eastern flank,"" Nauseda said in Poland.

The president emphasised that Russia would continue to be the primary and long-term military threat for the Alliance. Therefore, close cooperation with Poland in security and defence is a strategic priority for Lithuania, he said.

The president is sure that both countries will continue strengthening their partnership by implementing initiatives in the area of security and in joint development of the defence industry.

Nauseda pointed out that joint allied actions showcased at the exercise proved NATO's effectiveness and military interoperability capabilities.

The president also noted that fast military aid for Ukraine must remain the main priority as the country needs ammunition, air defence systems and greater production capabilities in all categories of armaments.

BBCEUP0020240305ek35001up,Nato plans foresee use of Polish troops in Lithuania defence - army chief,"Text of report in English by privately-owned Baltic News Service on 5 March

Korzeniew, Poland, 5 March: NATO plans foresee the use of Polish troops in Lithuania's defence, and, therefore, it's not a matter of bilateral relations, Lithuania's Chief of Defence General Valdemaras Rupsys says as he's visiting Poland where the Dragon 2024 exercise is taking place.","His comment comes amid the recent debate on whether Poland has the legal right to defend Lithuania if it is attacked.

""I don't know of any legal restrictions. The operational use of the Polish army is foreseen in NATO plans, it is a NATO issue. It is not a matter of our bilateral relations, it is a NATO matter,"" the army chief said. ""As far as I know, the task of the Polish army is clearly defined on our territory as well, and I do not see any problem with that.""

In his words, Poland, like other NATO countries, is guided by all the articles of the North Atlantic Treaty, including Article 5.

""There is no doubt that we will stand together anywhere, if necessary. (...) And on the issue of sending troops, they will be here,"" Rupsys said.

The Dragon 2024 exercise is aimed at testing allied ability to carry out deterrence and defence tasks by countering aggression by a potential enemy against NATO countries and conducting combat operations combining land, air and maritime components.

The exercise is one of the components of this year's NATO Steadfast Defender 2024 exercise.

According to the Lithuanian army, the centerpiece operation of Dragon-24 is the deployment of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force to assist an ally in the event of aggression, which will also highlight the nuances and potential challenges of military mobility across national borders. When the exercise ends, the German enhanced Vigilance Brigade battalion will relocate for continued training in Lithuania as of March 7.

A platoon from the Lithuanian army's Iron Wolf Infantry Brigade's reconnaissance company with JLTV all-terrain vehicles is currently participating in the exercise in Poland. In total, 20,000 troops and 3,500 pieces of military equipment from ten NATO countries are participating in the exercise.

The exercise is taking place in Lithuania amid a debate on whether Poland's own laws would allow it to defend Lithuania in the event of an attack on it.

Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said last week that Poland's legal restrictions ""do not impose an obligation"" to send troops abroad, even in the event of war, which would also apply in the event of an attack on neighbouring Lithuania.

Later, the prime minister added she did not mean that ""the Poles will not defend us"", but rather that she was referring to specific legal constraints, which she was seeking to resolve with Poland at the ""political level"". The prime minister also said that she could not specify which restrictions she was referring to.

Speaking earlier in the day, Kestutis Budrys, an adviser to Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, said that a defence plan for the Suwaiki Corridor was drawn up back in 2022, and Polish troops would also defend the territory in Lithuania, so there is no legal restriction on it.

Nauseda said on Monday that join Lithuanian-Polish army exercises were meant to make sure that both countries act together.

For his part, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who visited Lithuania on Monday, said that Lithuanian-Polish solidarity was unquestionable. He also added that the Polish and Lithuanian foreign and defence ministers would soon ""decide on all the details so that there are no communication issues and uncertainties"", to avoid speculation on the issue.

NATO's Article 5 stipulates that an armed attack on one or more of allied countries will be considered an attack on all of them. According to this article, all NATO members must agree to take action to help the attacked ally. However, any action requires the agreement of all NATO countries.

So far, this article has been activated once, in 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US.

Riga, 1 March: Safe navigation in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea is critical for global stability, Foreign Minister Krisjanis Karis (New Unity) said during a meeting with his Bulgarian, Greek, Estonian, Lithuanian and Romanian counterparts on Friday [1 March].","Karins today joined a video conference with his colleagues for a discussion on current developments in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions, including a greater involvement of NATO bodies in the strengthening of the security of those regions. The video conference was held at the initiative of the Bulgarian Foreign Minister Mariya Gabriel.

Since Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, safe navigation in the Black Sea has been under a serious threat due to incidents caused by Russia. Certain risks have also been observed in the Baltic Sea. ""Given that Russia's threat does not end at the borders of Ukraine and affects the entire Euro-Atlantic space, coordination between NATO countries is of particular importance. I emphasized that successful cooperation between the countries in the Baltic and Black Sea region is a precondition for restricting in Russia successfully,"" noted Karins.

With Finland and Sweden joining NATO and thereby reducing the influence of the Russian navy in the Baltic Sea, security has increased across the region. Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania, for their part, signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the establishment of the Task Force to Combat Sea Mines in the Black Sea (MCM Black Sea).

At the initial stages of the invasion, the Russian navy laid sea mines along the Black Sea coast, which pose threat to navigation and curb the efforts of Ukraine to break Russia's sea blockade. The mine countermeasures task force is to supervise the operations of the demining mission in the Black Sea.

Vilnius, 7 March: Around 700 German troops with more than 200 pieces of military equipment are set to arrive in Lithuania for training on Thursday.","The troops from the 91st Infantry Battalion of the German enhanced Vigilance Activity Brigade (eVA) assigned to Lithuania are coming from Poland where they took part in the first part of the Grand Eagle 24 exercise, trained and assessed the needs and challenges of military mobility across national borders.

The second part of the exercise will take place in Lithuania.

Both exercises are part of NATO's Europe-wide spring exercise Steadfast Defender 24.

The German eVA assigned to Lithuania has been on standby since 2022, and its forward command element is also deployed in the country.

Last year, the German army's 21st Panzer Brigade took over command of the eVA that consists of around 4,000 troops.

Berlin and Vilnius have agreed on the permanent deployment of the German brigade in Lithuania, and this is scheduled to be done by 2027. In total, around 5,000 troops and civilians will move to Lithuania.

Vilnius is looking for suitable infrastructure for the incoming German troops and their families.

German troops are being deployed in Lithuania in response to the increased Russian threat following the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine.

Vilnius, 25 March: A missile launched by Russia at western Ukraine entered Polish airspace on Sunday night. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Gabrielius Landsbergis, who paid a working visit to the United States, calls to send a clear message to Russia that missiles or drones entering NATO airspace will be shot down.","&#8220;This is not the first time that this is happening. There have been a number of violations of airspace in Romania and this is not the first time that Polish airspace was violated. So you could tell that one time is a mistake but if we allow that to happen, it sounds like an invitation. So we have to change our position, we have to change our posture and send a very clear message that if it happens again, the missiles, the drones, they will be taken down,&#8221; Landsbergis told Fox News during his visit to the USA.

The head of Lithuania&#8217;s diplomacy stressed that Ukraine has lacked US and European support recently.

&#8220;The situation in Ukraine is definitely not getting better. What Russians are doing with those rocket barrages over the last couple of days is they&#8217;re testing whether Ukraine does still have enough ammunition to take them down,&#8221; he said.

The minister added that Russia is amassing many new troops and there are talks about an additional mobilisation of half a million new soldiers.

&#8220;So the situation is getting worse and we have to have an answer to that. If Ukraine falls, Putin will not stop, that&#8217;s for sure,&#8221; Landsbergis stated.

Vilnius, 14 March: Command Headquarters personnel of the Lithuanian Land Force alongside Allies from 23 NATO members are training at a command-post exercise Loyal Leda 2024 (LOLE 24), reports the Armed Forces.","The exercise conducted by the NATO Joint Force Training Centre in Poland is designed to train and certify headquarters of units in subordination of the Headquarters Multinational Corps Northeast (HQ MNC NE) to plan and execute wide-scale defensive operations while organizing interoperability and coordinating actions with friendly forces.

""Exercise LOLE 24 is a vital event in our combat training cycle that certifies our readiness to deliver on our designated tasks. I can say ahead of the exercise that we are ready but we want to be even more ready. We want to demonstrate with this exercise to everyone that we are united with NATO Allies in defending our families and people against any threat,"" said HQ MNC NE Commander Lt Col Jurgen-Joachim von Sandrart on the day of the exercise opening.

Exercise LOLE 24 takes place in three stages. During the first phase, over 800 exercise participants were improving military decision-making, as well as command and control and interoperability procedures at unit integration training.

Over the second stage, unit command posts carried out defensive and indirect impact operation planning, interact with the civilian environment and adjacent units, coordinate actions with the superior headquarters, and create tactical operational plans using a tactical command and control information system.

In the third phase a simulation system is used to put to test operational concepts created by the unit command posts. The simulation system follows the training concept developed by the Control Party to allow creation of a tactical situation for generating events and incidents and adapting to the dynamic and ever-changing situation while executing command and control procedures, taking timely tactical decisions in coordination of actions between units, ensuring uninterrupted execution of operation in coordination with the superior staff and functionality of command posts.

BBCEUP0020240313ek3d0012x,Experts list measures to strengthen Estonia's defence capabilities,"Text of report in English by privately-owned Baltic News Service on 12 March

TALLINN, Mar 12, BNS - As measures to strengthen Estonia's defence capabilities, experts speaking at the CGI media morning on defence and aerospace industry in Tallinn on Tuesday listed the digitalisation of the defence industry, increasing defence spending from 3 percent to 5 percent of GDP, and the need for better collaboration between the state and the private sector.","Tarmo Ranisoo, retired colonel and expert at CGI Eesti, said that as a country on NATO's eastern border, we need to prepare consistently. He stressed that it is the battlefield that determines what is needed in the market and what works.

""Digitalisation is essential to speed up combat operations and improve situational awareness. Artillery without a round inside is a halfway solution. Just like hardware that doesn't come with smart enough software,"" he said.

Taavi Veskimagi, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Estonian Defence and Aerospace Industry Association, said in a panel discussion that Estonia's defence spending of 3 percent of GDP is not enough and will probably grow to at least 5 percent in the near term.

""I'm more than sure that we're going to see a significantly higher contribution than 3 percent, at least 5 percent, over the next five years to achieve sufficient deterrence,"" Veskimagi said. It will be then necessary that everything we can produce locally in order to strengthen our defence capability is produced here as well, by our own industries, he added.

Veskimagi said defence spending rising to 5 percent of GDP would be an opportunity for Estonian defence industry companies.

""What will matter is how Estonian companies will furnish this 5 percent, because if all that money - 5 percent of our GDP - goes abroad, it will already be a problem in terms of the foreign trade balance."" To mitigate this, Veskimagi says, everything that is possible must be produced and done locally in Estonia. ""This is necessary both to increase defence capabilities and for economic development, to maintain and create jobs.""

Brig. Gen. Vahur Karus, chief of the Estonian Military Academy, said the introduction of new technologies in national defence always comes with a price tag.

""This raises the question of whether we also have the human resources who know how to put new technologies to work and whether we are able to train people, adapt hardware, maintain it, keep it going,"" Karus said.

""Last year, we began to understand that the defence forces need a large number of engineers. Now, we train tactical operators in the defence forces who can handle basic operation of equipment because all training exercises include components of digital warfare. It makes no sense to establish an engineering course at the Estonian Military Academy in a situation where engineering is taught in five universities in Estonia. Therefore, our strategy is to incorporate engineers into the needs of the defence forces for a fixed term so that they return to civilian jobs with the experience gained and continue to contribute to the next technological developments there. This is human resource development that goes in long cycles,"" Karus said.

CGI is a global software company with operations in 40 countries, whose national branches have a high degree of overlap with NATO member states. In Estonia, CGI has been operating since the early years since the country regained its independence. With 200 employees, CGI Eesti is the largest aerospace company in Estonia, whose digital solutions are used in the energy sector, the public sector and agriculture.

""I am aware that this cooperation involves sending a message of solidarity and our NATO principles -- that we stand up for each other and are ready to defend every inch of NATO territory together. This is also my message to the Baltic states -- we stand together shoulder to shoulder,"" Scholz said.

Turning attention to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Scholz said that the West ""must do more and enough to support Ukraine.""

The chancellor indicated that Germany is providing large amounts of support -- almost 28 billion euros in total in arms supplies and other forms of aid.

Scholz also welcomed recent decisions to support Ukraine more broadly, such as the Czech ammunition supply initiative.

Tsahkna recognised all politicians and diplomats whose efforts across more than 10 years preceding our Nato accession eventually took Estonia into the alliance.

&#8220;Our path to joining the alliance was far from smooth and straightforward; instead, it came about thanks to hard work and a coincidence of circumstances,&#8221; Tsahkna said.

NYTFEED020240319ek3j00439,"U.S. Vows to Continue Support for Ukraine, Despite Funding Doubts","The American defense secretary told a meeting of Kyiv’s backers that the fight against Russia “remains one of the great causes of our time.”

The United States and European nations vowed on Tuesday to maintain military support for Ukraine, even though future American aid remains snarled in Congress and modest donations of new weapons reflected an alliance with relatively little left to give as the war against Russia enters a critical stretch.","The U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, in Germany for the start of a meeting of about 50 governments that are supplying Kyiv’s forces, said that allies would “dig deeper to get vital security assistance to Ukraine.”

To that end, Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would send Ukraine 10,000 rounds of badly needed artillery shells, 100 armored infantry vehicles and transport equipment in a new $544 million infusion of support. The Finnish defense chief, Antti Häkkänen, announced a $32 million donation to help the Czech Republic buy 800,000 rounds of ammunition, including from beyond NATO-member militaries and manufacturers.

And Mr. Austin highlighted the new $300 million package of attack and air defense missiles, artillery rounds and armor systems that the United States pledged for Ukraine last week.

Yet Ukrainian forces could burn through much of the new aid within months, if not weeks. It is unlikely that the Biden administration will be able to send much more unless Republicans in the House of Representatives unlock a $60 billion emergency spending plan for additional weapons for Ukraine and to bolster armament production in the United States.

“We will have to deal with it, and we will deal with it,” Mr. Pistorius said on the sidelines of the meeting, held at Ramstein Air Base, an American military hub in Germany, when asked about the blocked funding in Washington.

He said Germany was prepared to continue supporting Ukraine, and “I’m sure and I’m convinced the United States will, like it used to do before, too.”

Mr. Austin declared at the meeting’s start that “Ukraine’s battle remains one of the great causes of our time.” Later, he cast the war as “crucial to our own security” in remarks that seemed directed more toward critics in Congress than to the journalists before him in Germany.

“The United States would face grave new perils in a world where aggression and autocracy are on the march, and where tyrants are emboldened, and where dictators think that they can wipe democracy off the map,” Mr. Austin said.

“Today, Ukraine’s survival is in danger and America’s security is at risk,” he said. “They don’t have a day to waste, and we don’t have a day to spare either.”

While the United States remains the single largest donor of military support to Ukraine, Mr. Austin praised recent donations of weapons by Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden. He also noted the Czech campaign to scrounge the world for artillery shells, the first tranche of which could arrive on the battlefield within weeks.

Ukraine’s soldiers are already running out of many munitions: A shortage of artillery shells helped force a retreat in the eastern city of Avdiivka, and air defense missiles have been rationed around the highest-priority cities and infrastructure to protect against Russian strikes.

On Monday, after meeting Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine ticked off a list of missiles, fighter jets and shells that he said were urgently needed on front lines.

In his own summary of the Monday meeting in Kyiv, Mr. Graham predicted that at least some American assistance to Ukraine would arrive as loans, as former President Donald J. Trump has urged, instead of donated outright.

“I know Americans want to help our friends and allies, but I also believe we must consider our economic situation as we help others,” Mr. Graham said in a statement. He said he would also demand that the Biden administration send longer-range missiles to Ukraine, enabling its forces to strike Russian-held territory, and speed training for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 warplanes.

The uncertainty over the American commitment to Ukraine has largely left European allies to try to fill the gap, but producers of key weapon systems and artillery ammunition have struggled to ramp up and are unable to keep pace with the demand.

Some European leaders — especially in the Baltics, Nordic countries and nations that border Ukraine — have also raised alarms about the specter of Russia’s invading NATO territory should it win the current conflict.

Mr. Austin echoed those concerns ahead of the meeting at Ramstein, where he sat next to Ukraine’s defense minister, Rustem Umerov. It was Mr. Austin’s first in-person return to the group since two hospitalizations this year, including a dayslong stint in January related to complications from prostate cancer surgery that he did not disclose to the White House, prompting criticism.

“Let’s not kid ourselves: Putin will not stop at Ukraine,” Mr. Austin said. “But as President Biden has said, Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself.”

Vilnius, 7 March: Lithuania is in talks with ammunition manufacturers concerning production of artillery shells in the country.","""Very concrete talks are ongoing with an investor and a manufacturer. Perhaps this is not linked directly with Giraite [ammunition factory]. This has to do more with the needs of Lithuania and the region,"" said Anusauskas at a press conference on Thursday.

The minister said that in the near future it should transpire where the production would take place and what volume of shells would be made. According to him, countries, including those on NATO's eastern flank, are expanding production of 155 mm artillery shells and thus talks on the matter are ongoing.

Anusauskas added that Lithuania on Thursday was able to transfer some 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine because a schedule for their replenishment has been created.

Vilnius, 5 March: Drawing from bitter lessons of the past, Lithuania and Poland understand that indecision, disunity, or concessions to aggressors like Russia only serve to embolden them and escalate conflicts, emphasised Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte during her meeting with Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Vilnius on Monday.","The two prime ministers agreed that the shared perception of threats, bolstering regional security, and standing by Ukraine are pivotal aspects of cooperation, the Government said in a press release.

The prime ministers discussed support for Ukraine, the strengthening and implementation of sanctions against Russia and Belarus, relevant items on the EU agenda, preparations for the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, as well as the bilateral relations between Lithuania and Poland.

""Russia's objectives remain unchanged - the obliteration of Ukraine's independence and identity, undermining democracy, and substituting the rules-based world order with power politics, thus posing a grave threat to the entire free world. Hence, supporting Ukraine today, urgently and with all that is necessary for its victory, is the best thing we can do for the Ukrainians who suffer daily terror and for our own security,"" said Prime Minister Simonyte.

As noted at the meeting, Lithuania and Poland see eye-to-eye on threats, as both countries are aware that Russia will remain a long-term military threat, which is evident not only from its aggressive rhetoric, but also from its aim to rebuild the capabilities lost in Ukraine and the orientation of the country's economy towards military objectives.

In this context, Simonyte pointed out that Poland's leadership in strengthening its defence is an important example for allies to follow. Reinforced defence, together with support for Ukraine, is the best investment in the security of NATO as a whole. The Alliance's defence must not be weakened, and Lithuania, for its part, has been increasing its defence budget in recent years and will continue to build its national defence, the Lithuanian prime minister added.

Lithuania highly values Poland's contributions to regional security, bilateral defence cooperation, and is eager to further enhance these ties, Simonyte noted.

The prime minister stressed the need to sustain and intensify pressure through sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, while also striving for more effective implementation of the existing sanctions.

While current efforts are focused on security, Prime Minister Simonyte also recognised the increasingly strong bilateral cooperation spanning from infrastructure to cultural exchanges.

Ingrida Simonyte thanked Donald Tusk for excellent partnership and commitment to joint work towards interconnecting the Baltic electricity grids with continental Europe via Poland by February 2025.

The prime minister also said that the transport links that the two countries are developing - the Rail Baltica and Via Baltica - are not only significant projects in terms of the security of the region, but they also bring real, practical benefits to the people of both countries.

The country became a full-fledged member of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on 29 March 2024.","The Ministry of National Defence invites everyone to take this opportunity to look back on the journey Lithuania has had over the twenty years, what we have received from cooperation with the Allies and were able to give in exchange.

I have no doubt that having more Germany in Lithuania and more Lithuania in Germany would contribute to the prosperity of both countries,&#8221; said the prime minister.

Simonyte also noted the strong public support for the stationing of the German brigade in Lithuania, assuring that Lithuania, as the host country, will provide all necessary conditions for German troops and their families.

It is reassuring to see the process progressing smoothly, added the head of Government.

On the one hand, Peskov said, Macron had aired the idea of soldiers from Nato states ending up on the front lines in Ukraine, only for the French foreign minister to dismiss the idea.

""But one thing is clear. Mr Macron is convinced of his policy of inflicting a strategic defeat on our country,"" Peskov said. ""He continues to increase the level of direct French involvement in this war. From our point of view, this in no way corresponds to the interests of the French.""

BBCSUP0020240306ek36000rt,Moscow calls US nuclear sites in northern Europe 'legitimate targets',"By BBC Monitoring

US nuclear weapons sites in northern Europe would become legitimate targets in the event of a direct armed clash between Nato and Russia, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said, state TASS news agency reported on 6 March.","Speaking on the sidelines of the World Youth Festival, she said: ""You don't need to be a military strategist to understand that such sites would present a source of direct military threat, and naturally, it is inevitable they would be on the list of legitimate targets in a military conflict scenario between our country and Nato.""

Zakharova was commenting in response to Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb's comment that it was important that his country ""should have nuclear deterrent forces"".

Zakharova said in the event American nuclear weapons appeared in northern Europe, ""the security of those states accepting those these weapons will not be increased, but will clearly suffer, because other countries: neighbouring countries, countries of the continent - and given the development of technology, not only of the continent - will be forced to take all this into account"".

BBCSAP0020240311ek3b001b9,"Pakistan's Dunya TV show on political tensions, economic issues","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Think Tank"", hosted by anchor Marrium Zeshan on moderate Dunya News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 10 March 2024. Experts Rasul Bakhsh Rais and Hasan Askari, journalists Salman Ghani and Rasheed Safi are regular analysts on the programme and express their opinions and analysis on important political issues.","Anchor Marrium Zeshan said leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) staged protests against alleged rigging in the recent elections. She noted rallies were staged in various cities and some of the protesters, including Sardar Latif Khosa and Salman Akram Raja (prominent PTI politicians), were arrested. She mentioned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur (PTI member) addressed a protest rally in Peshawar and demanded that Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) should be given the right to a fair trial and the PTI's ""stolen mandate"" should be returned to it. She added Gandapur also demanded that a commission should be formed to look into the allegations of election rigging.

Zeshan questioned whether the arrest of people is justified when peaceful protest is a democratic right. Journalist Salman Ghani said peaceful protests are a right but the opposition has always been facing the same situation in Pakistan. He added protest and resistance politics is effective only for a certain time, and if protests continue for a long time, political workers get tired of them. He was of the view that this protest by the PTI would affect the economy of Pakistan and not the government.

Noting that the PTI could not stage a big show in Punjab, particularly in Lahore, Ghani said the party should review its actions like writing a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) against the release of funds to the government. He reminded the PTI leadership that protests ultimately come to an end through dialogue.

Analyst Hasan Askari was of the view that matters are not being handled ""democratically"" and said principles of democracy and fundamental rights should be applied across the board. He remarked ""coercive apparatus"" of the state can control the protests for the time being but it would increase hatred. He criticised the government for not focusing on solving the problems of the people. He claimed there is so much despondency among the people that ""80 per cent of the people would leave Pakistan if given an option"".

Analyst Rasul Bakhsh Rais said the PTI cannot bring about a revolution or topple the government through these protests, nor can it change the election results. He added the party wants to reinforce an impression continuously in the country and abroad that the elections were rigged. Noting that the goal of politics is to resolve disputes, he remarked no political leader in Pakistan is ready to address the cause of political tensions.

Journalist Rasheed Safi said demand for a commission over the election results is a ""realistic demand"" and it would be good if it is accepted. However, he added, it is not likely that the demand would be taken into consideration. He was of the view that Imran Khan is also not likely to be given any relief. He urged the federal government to play its constitutional role in dealing with the provinces and also asked Gandapur to not use his constitutional position to promote his political interests. He warned if tension persists, it would provide an opportunity to anti-state elements to promote hatred in the province [KP], which is already in the ""grip of terrorism"".

Ghani disagreed with Askari's view that 80 per cent of the Pakistanis would leave the country if they are given a chance to do so. He said Pakistan did not face such issues till 2017 when it was the ""24th largest economy"". He claimed the economy was derailed by removing former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from power. He agreed that a commission should be formed to look into the allegations of election rigging, along with several other issues. He claimed the PTI's politics of protest is aimed at damaging the country's economy.

Zeshan noted prices of essential items have skyrocketed even before the beginning of Ramadan (the month of fasting for Muslims) and asked Ghani what could be the solution to this issue. Ghani replied it is a very sad situation that prices have doubled within two days and would further increase during Ramadan. He said this is a challenge for the new government.

Askari noted the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government cannot control the prices because its main support base is made up of traders and businessmen. He said instead of solving the issue of inflation, the government starts distributing free items. He mentioned political activists get arrested but no shopkeeper is arrested for profiteering because the party gets votes from them.

Rais was of the view that the government should bring reforms to manage the supply of food items from farms to common consumers so that it can control hoarding and price hikes.

NYTFEED020240328ek3s0080x,Taiwan’s Top Diplomat Says U.S. Aid to Ukraine Is Critical for Deterring China,"Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said in an interview that a Russian victory could embolden China to move against Taiwan and would fuel anti-American propaganda.

Joseph Wu, the foreign minister of Taiwan, said on Thursday that a halt in U.S. arms shipments to Ukraine would embolden China in its aggressions against Taiwan and fuel propaganda from Beijing that the United States is an unreliable partner.","“When people ask us whether it is OK for the United States to abandon Ukraine, the answer is no, because the world is operating not in a black-and-white way, or if you only look at one theater at a time,” he said. “The world is interconnected.”

If Russia is able to occupy more of Ukraine and claim victory, he added, “it would be seen as a victory of authoritarian states because Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, they are now linked together.”

Mr. Wu’s comments, made in a wide-ranging hourlong interview in Taipei, come as the Biden administration tries to get Congress to pass a supplemental funding package that would give $60 billion of aid to Ukraine.

Many House Republicans are staunchly opposed to giving more aid to Ukraine, adopting the “America First” posture embraced by former President Donald J. Trump, a pro-Russia candidate who has pressed them to reject the package. For months they claimed they would be willing to consider providing more assistance for Kyiv if the Biden administration imposed severe immigration restrictions at the United States border with Mexico. But at Mr. Trump’s urging, they balked at a funding package that would have done that, calling the border measures too weak.

The package also includes $8 billion of aid to counter China in the Asia-Pacific region, $1.9 billion of which would refill stocks of U.S. weapons sent to Taiwan. And it includes $14.1 billion of military aid to Israel.

Some Republican lawmakers contend that China is a bigger threat than Russia and that the funding proposed for Ukraine should go toward countering China. But other Republican officials in Congress and many Democrats make the same argument as Mr. Wu: that Taiwan’s security is linked to that of Ukraine, because China will see weakness on the part of the United States — and a greater chance of success in a potential invasion of Taiwan — if Ukraine is defeated.

Chinese leaders have said for decades that Taiwan, a de facto independent island, must be brought under the rule of the Communist Party, by force if necessary. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has continued to promote that position.

The U.S. and Taiwanese governments have been trying to deter China from notions of invading Taiwan, including through military buildup in the region and bolstering alliances with other democratic nations.

If the United States abandons Ukraine, Mr. Wu said, China will “take it as a hint” that if it can keep up sustained action against Taiwan, “the United States is going to back off, the United States and its allies are going to back off.” The thinking among Chinese officials would be this, he said: “OK, since Russia could do that, we can do that as well.”

“So the U.S. determination in providing support to those countries suffering from authoritarian aggression, it is very important,” Mr. Wu said.

After U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, China pushed propaganda through traditional state-run media and social media that “the U.S. commitment to anything is not firm,” Mr. Wu said. “We suffered from a huge wave of cognitive warfare.”

China has also spread disinformation stressing Russian narratives of the war, Mr. Wu said, including the idea that the expansion of NATO forced President Vladimir V. Putin to attack Ukraine, and that the United States is ultimately not committed to supporting Ukraine.

On the eve of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, and their two governments announced a “no limits” partnership.

Mr. Wu said some Central and Eastern European nations seeking to forge anti-authoritarian partnerships had strengthened their relations with Taiwan during the war.

His comments on the need for the United States to keep supporting Taiwan echo those of other senior Taiwanese officials. In May 2023, Bi-khim Hsiao, then Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States and now the incoming vice president, made similar arguments to reporters in Washington.

And in February, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said during a visit of American lawmakers to Taiwan that the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the president-elect, Lai Ching-te, made clear to the lawmakers that “if for some reason the Ukrainians do not prevail, that will only encourage hostilities against Taiwan.”"
NYTFEED020240307ek370096l,Biden tries to rally support for Ukraine as unity in Congress gives way to bickering.,"Two years ago, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dominated President Biden’s first State of the Union address before a Congress that, for all of its divisions, was largely united in vowing American help to a country fighting to repel the advancing troops of President Vladimir V. Putin.

Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, declined an invitation, citing a scheduling conflict. Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader who died in a Russian prison last month, Aleksei A. Navalny, was also invited but is unable to attend.

And it is unclear how many lawmakers will be waving Ukrainian flags this year, as the initial outrage that welled after Mr. Putin’s invasion has given way to the partisan squabbling and gridlock that now characterize politics in the United States.

Mr. Biden’s latest aid package proposal — $60.1 billion for badly needed artillery ammunition, air defense interceptors and other weapons — remains stalled in Congress, already undermining the fight on the ground in Ukraine, where American officials say more than 500,000 have been killed and injured between the two sides.

Mr. Putin’s military was forced to abandon its drive to Kyiv, the capital, on April 2, 2022, thanks to stiff Ukrainian resistance helped by real-time intelligence provided by the United States and NATO allies, not to mention poor logistics and tactical decision-making on the Russian part. But Russia decimated many cities and towns in the east and established a “land bridge” connecting the mainland with Crimea, the peninsula that Mr. Putin illegally seized in 2014. And two years on, depleted Ukrainian forces are still trying to hold off advancing Russian troops in the east.

Mr. Biden will certainly exhort Congress to move forward on the aid package in his speech, administration officials said. But some contingency planning is also underway.

The administration is trying to cobble together a stopgap package of artillery ammunition and air defense interceptors, paid for with money from Army contracts that came in under bid, U.S. officials said. That measure, which could also include some longer-range guided missiles known as ATACMs, was unlikely to be ready in time to announce during Mr. Biden’s remarks on Thursday, they added.

But at best, the makeshift solution would only keep advancing Russian troops at bay for a few weeks.

Mr. Biden will be able to point to at least one success that has resulted from Mr. Putin’s invasion: One person who accepted the White House invitation is the Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden, which became NATO’s newest member just a few hours before Mr. Biden’s speech was scheduled to begin.

Sweden along with Finland decided to apply to join NATO shortly after the invasion began, expanding the alliance that has so bedeviled Mr. Putin."
NYTFEED020240312ek3c0023b,"Biden Offers ‘Ironclad’ Commitment to Allies, Defying Russia (and Trump)","The president hosted leaders of Poland at the White House as he sought to reassure NATO members of American steadfastness in the face of threats from Moscow and former President Donald J. Trump.

President Biden pledged an “ironclad” commitment to America’s allies on Tuesday as he sought to reassure NATO members that the United States would not abandon its international obligations despite the threats of aggression by Russia and disruption by his all-but-certain fall election rival, former President Donald J. Trump.","Hosting the leaders of Poland at the White House, Mr. Biden made a show of defiance not only against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who continues to wage war on Ukraine, but also, implicitly at least, against Mr. Trump, who has said he would “encourage” Russia to attack NATO members that do not spend enough on their militaries.

“When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,” Mr. Biden said, citing former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Czech-born diplomat who championed NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and her homeland, finalized on this day in 1999 with the support of Mr. Biden, then a senator. “I believed that then, and I believe it now,” he added.

The meeting with President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland marked the 25th anniversary of their country’s accession to NATO, which was the beginning of a quarter-century post-Cold War expansion of the alliance into parts of Europe previously dominated by the old Soviet Union. Just this month, NATO formally welcomed Sweden, which like Finland joined in response to Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022, increasing the alliance to 32 members, up from 16 when the Berlin Wall fell.

Mr. Biden used the occasion to announce $300 million in additional weapons and military equipment for Ukraine, a small fraction of what he has asked Congress for but all he could squeeze out of savings from previous arms transfers without additional legislative authority. He pressed House Republican leaders to stop blocking legislation passed by the Senate for $60 billion in security aid to Ukraine, a measure that has bipartisan support and would almost surely pass if brought to the floor.

“We must act before it literally is too late, before it’s too late, because as Poland remembers, Russia won’t stop at Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said. “Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States and the entire free world at risk.”

Mr. Biden praised the Polish leaders not only for investing in the alliance but also for taking in about one million Ukrainians who have fled the war. “You’re doing God’s work,” he told the leaders. “You really are. It’s incredible what you’re doing, what the Polish people are doing.”

He also promised Poland a $2 billion military loan and approved the sale of 96 Apache attack helicopters to Warsaw.

Poland sits on the frontline of the alliance, perpetually wary of Russian revanchism and staunchly supportive of Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, as it defends itself against Mr. Putin’s forces. Poland spends more on its military as a proportion than any other member of the alliance, nearly 4 percent of its economy, twice the alliance’s goal. Mr. Duda used the White House visit to propose that NATO increase its target from 2 percent of gross domestic product to 3 percent.

“Other allies must take more responsibility for the security of the alliance as a whole,” Mr. Duda said as he sat with Mr. Biden in the East Room of the White House. “Two percent was good 10 years ago. Now 3 percent is required in response to the full-scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO’s eastern border.”

The alliance’s leaders agreed in 2014 to the 2 percent goal, but it was a nonbinding aspiration to meet by 2024. While several American presidents have pushed NATO to do more for its own defense, Mr. Trump was more bellicose in demanding that allies raise their military spending and spoke of it as if they owed the money to the United States, which was not true.

Under Mr. Trump, the number of NATO members meeting the 2 percent goal increased to nine from six. Under Mr. Biden, it has doubled to 18, reflecting rising fear of Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The United States spends 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, and most of the other top spenders are in Eastern Europe, closer to Russia. Collectively, the European allies are spending 2 percent of their combined gross domestic product this year, or $380 billion.

While Mr. Biden did not mention Mr. Trump by name on Tuesday, Mr. Tusk seemed to allude to comments in which the former president scoffed at the mutual defense obligation in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. “We treat our obligations seriously, more than anyone else in Europe,” Mr. Tusk said. “And we hope that none of our NATO partners will undermine the most important obligation, which is Article 5 of the treaty.”

The visit by the Polish leaders was the first since a landmark election in October, when opposition parties defeated the ruling Law and Justice party, a right-wing faction accused of subverting democracy as it consolidated power over major institutions like the judiciary, the news media, the central bank and large state-controlled corporations.

Mr. Duda and Mr. Tusk, who was installed in December as prime minister, are fierce rivals who have clashed repeatedly at home. Mr. Duda is an ally of Law and Justice who curried favor with Mr. Trump when he was in office, while Mr. Tusk is a veteran centrist who during a previous stint as prime minister from 2007 to 2014 worked with Mr. Biden, then the vice president.

Their conflict led to a dramatic showdown in January when Mr. Duda gave shelter in the presidential palace to two former officials from his party previously convicted of abuse of power. Mr. Tusk accused Mr. Duda of obstruction of justice, and the police were sent into the palace to arrest the former officials.

But in a measure of how seriously Poland takes the Russian threat, the two rivals agreed to put aside their differences for their joint visit with Mr. Biden. “I differ politically with President Andrzej Duda on almost everything,” Mr. Tusk wrote in Polish on social media, “but when it comes to the security of our homeland, we must and will act together. Not only during a visit to the USA.”"
NYTFEED020240312ek3c0060p,U.S. to Send $300 Million in Weapons to Ukraine Under Makeshift Plan,"The package will keep advancing Russian troops at bay for only a few weeks, an official said.

The Biden administration announced on Tuesday that it was sending up to $300 million in weapons to Ukraine, the first new aid package for the country since funding ran out in late December.","The package, pulled together from money that Army accountants cobbled from savings from contracts that came in under bid, includes air defense interceptors, artillery rounds and armor systems, senior defense officials said. Two U.S. officials said the package also includes an older version of the Army’s longer-range missile systems known as ATACMS, which can travel 100 miles.

It is a stopgap measure at best, the officials said, but Ukraine is in dire need of air defense systems in particular, as Russia has continued its bombardment of towns particularly in the east.

The makeshift solution would keep advancing Russian troops at bay for only a few weeks, one official said.

Announcing the aid package at the White House, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that “Ukrainian troops have fought bravely, are fighting bravely throughout this war, but they are now forced to ration their ammunition under pressure on multiple fronts.”

He said the new package would “keep Ukraine’s guns firing for a period, but only a short period.” Mr. Sullivan called for Congress to pass a new Ukraine aid bill “as soon as possible.”

He said that Ukraine desperately needed the assistance to hold the line against Russian attacks, but that “it goes without saying this package does not displace and should not delay the critical need to pass the bipartisan national security bill.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his overnight address, thanked “the United States and all Americans who value freedom” for their support of his country.

The Senate passed an emergency aid bill including $60.1 billion for Ukraine. But the measure faces an uncertain fate in the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders have refused to put the measure to a vote. While congressional officials say there is a critical mass of support for continuing to arm Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, the Republican Party is increasingly turning away from its traditional hawkish posture and belief in projecting American power and democratic principles around the world.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican of Louisiana who has opposed aiding Ukraine, must navigate a handful of ultraconservative lawmakers who have said they will move to oust him if he allows a vote on Ukraine aid without stringent immigration measures attached.

On Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, urged Mr. Johnson to hold a vote on the Ukraine aid package.

“I want to encourage the speaker again to allow a vote,” he said.

For President Biden, who has led the way in calling for the West to stand up for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and occupation, the issue has become an embarrassing one on the international stage.

The American political paralysis has led, Pentagon officials said, to critical shortages on the battlefields of Ukraine. As each day goes by without a fresh supply of munitions and artillery, and Ukrainian crews ration the shells they have, morale suffers.

“When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back; that’s costing terrain,” Mr. Sullivan said. “It’s costing lives and it’s costing us, the United States and the NATO alliance, strategically.”

Since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has sent more than $75 billion in cash and equipment to the country for its defense. Most of the aid has gone to Ukraine’s military operations, keeping its government running and addressing its humanitarian needs.

The money ran out in December, and Mr. Biden asked Congress for the authority to begin a new infusion of cash and equipment that only it can approve. But many Republicans object to pouring more taxpayer dollars into the conflict.

Senior intelligence officials warned on Monday that without additional American aid, Ukraine faced the prospect of continued battlefield losses as Russia uses a network of arms suppliers and increases its supply of technology from China.

In public testimony during the annual survey of worldwide threats facing the United States, the officials told Congress that any continued delay of U.S. aid would lead to additional territorial gains by Russia over the next year, the consequences of which would be felt in Europe and in the Pacific.

On Tuesday, Denmark also announced a new $340 million military aid package for Ukraine.

NYTFEED020240325ek3p00439,"Vowing the U.S. Will ‘Do Our Job,’ Johnson Searches for a Path on Ukraine","The Republican speaker, with his job on the line, has privately told people he would make sure the House moves to assist Ukraine, a step that many members of his party oppose.

When Speaker Mike Johnson opened the floor for questions at a closed-door luncheon fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, Jacquie Colgan asked how, in the face of vehement opposition within his own ranks, he planned to handle aid for Ukraine.","What followed was an impassioned monologue by Mr. Johnson in which he explained why continued American aid to Kyiv was, in his view, vital — a message starkly at odds with the hard-right views that have overtaken his party. He invoked his political roots as a Reagan Republican, denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a “madman” and conceded the issue had forced him to walk a “delicate political tightrope.”

Reminded by Ms. Colgan, a member of the American Coalition for Ukraine, a nonprofit advocacy group, of the adage that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was for good people to do nothing, Mr. Johnson replied that he kept a copy of the quotation framed in his office.

“That’s not going to be us,” he assured her. “We’re going to do our job.”

The exchange reflects what Mr. Johnson has privately told donors, foreign leaders and fellow members of Congress in recent weeks, according to extensive notes Ms. Colgan took during the New Jersey event and interviews with several other people who have spoken with him.

While the speaker has remained noncommittal about any one option, he has repeatedly expressed a personal desire to send aid to Ukraine — something he has voted against repeatedly in the past — and now appears to be in search of the least politically damaging way to do it.

The challenge for Mr. Johnson is that any combination of aid measures he puts to a vote will likely infuriate the growing isolationist wing of his party, which considers the issue toxic. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who has repeatedly said she would call a snap vote to unseat the speaker if he allowed a vote for Ukraine aid before imposing restrictive immigration measures, filed a resolution on Friday calling for his removal, saying she wanted to send him “a warning.”

Even if Ms. Greene follows through on the threat, Mr. Johnson could still hold onto his job. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, has said he believed “a reasonable number” of Democrats would vote to save the speaker were he to face a Republican mutiny for acting on the Senate-passed aid package, though on Friday Mr. Jeffries said that had been “an observation, not a declaration.”

In a lengthy statement on Friday after Ms. Greene had filed her resolution and the House departed Washington for its Easter recess, Mr. Johnson said that when lawmakers returned in two weeks, they would “take the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request.”

“We have done important work discussing options with members,” he said, “and are preparing to complete our plan for action.”

Privately, Mr. Johnson has expressed an interest in linking Ukraine aid to a measure aimed at forcing the Biden administration to reverse its moratorium on liquefied natural gas exports, according to three people familiar with his deliberations who were not authorized to discuss them. Mr. Johnson pressed the issue at a White House meeting last month with President Biden and congressional leaders, arguing that by prohibiting new exports of domestic energy, the administration was increasing reliance on Russian gas, effectively enriching Ukraine’s enemy.

In that meeting, according to a person familiar with the comments, Mr. Johnson raised the case of Calcasieu Pass 2, a proposed export terminal that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles, La., and would dwarf the country’s existing export terminals. The Biden administration in January had paused a decision on whether to approve it.

He has puzzled over whether to put the aid to a vote on the House floor packaged with assistance for other U.S. allies, including Israel and Taiwan, or allow lawmakers to vote on them separately to register their support for each individual nation.

With many Republicans bent on blocking aid to Ukraine, any legislation carrying it would need to be considered using a special procedure that bypasses House rules and requires a two-thirds majority for passage, relying heavily on votes from Democrats. But a combined aid package for both Ukraine and Israel like the one that passed the Senate last month could be doomed by a coalition of right-wing Republicans opposing the money for Kyiv and left-wing Democrats opposing aid for Israel.

Mr. Johnson has pondered imposing new sanctions against Russia. And he has debated how the money should be structured — straight assistance versus a loan — and whether it should be exclusively for lethal aid, a type of assistance that is more widely supported by his conference, or also include nonmilitary assistance.

“There is a big distinction in the minds of a lot of people between lethal aid for Ukraine, and the humanitarian component,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference at the Capitol last week.

Both he and Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have publicly floated the idea of paying for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen using legislation called the REPO Act.

Mr. Johnson has faced mounting international pressure to allow a vote on aid to Ukraine, fielding almost weekly visits and calls from NATO allies and pro-Ukraine activists both at his offices in Washington and Louisiana. When Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland visited Washington earlier this month, he had a sharp public message for the speaker.

“This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,” Mr. Tusk told reporters. “The absence of this positive decision of Mr. Johnson will really cost thousands of lives there — children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.”

Meeting privately with Mr. Johnson in his office in the Capitol, President Andrzej Duda of Poland appealed to the Louisiana Republican’s respect for President Ronald Reagan, whose portrait hung beside the speaker during the meeting. Mr. Duda quoted Mr. Reagan extensively and praised his willingness to call out good versus evil during the Cold War, according to a person familiar with the comments who requested anonymity to describe them.

Some skeptical Ukraine backers, both on and off Capitol Hill, have fretted that Mr. Johnson’s agreeable comments have simply reflected his penchant for telling people what they want to hear. Early in Mr. Johnson’s tenure as speaker, lawmakers noticed that he had a habit of leaving listeners from warring factions with the impression he agreed with each of them.

Yet at the fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, he was fairly candid about his calculations.

Mr. Johnson told the audience that he was “working to figure out the best route forward,” Ms. Colgan recalled, adding that he said that half of House Republicans wanted to move it together as a package with Israel and Taiwan, and the other half wanted to do it on its own.

At a separate fund-raiser in Binghamton for a congressman in New York’s Hudson Valley last month, Christina Zawerucha, the executive director of the Together for Ukraine Foundation, and Anatoliy Pradun, the group’s president, who was born and raised in Ukraine, approached the speaker to press him on holding a vote.

Mr. Pradun had hoped to appeal to Mr. Johnson’s faith by telling him of the strong evangelical Christian community in Ukraine. But realizing they had little time to make their case, Ms. Zawerucha and Mr. Pradun instead gave the speaker a pin with the Ukrainian and American flags, showed him their poster advertising an upcoming interfaith vigil for Ukraine and implored him to schedule a vote on aid to Kyiv.

“He didn’t turn us away,” Ms. Zawerucha said. “He pointed at our poster and said, ‘I will take care of this. I will take care of this.’”

When Ms. Zawerucha relayed the interaction to fellow activists after the luncheon, they asked what she thought he meant.

“And at this point, I don’t know,” she said. “It’s been over a month since Speaker Johnson said he would take care of this. And a vote for Ukraine still has not been allowed on the floor.”

Afghan political commentators on&#160;private Tolo News TV's regular Farakhabar (Beyond the News) programme on 5 March&#160;discussed the significance of the visits of the Taliban's defence minister and their joint chief of staff to Qatar.","Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the Taliban de facto government's defence minister and Qari&#160;Fasihuddin Fitrat, the Taliban army's chief of staff, travelled to Doha on 3 March for talks with Qatari officials and to attend an international defence expo.

Pro-Taliban political commentator Fazl Rahman Orya said that the visit underscored the close diplomatic ties between Kabul and Doha.

""It is a high-profile trip by the Afghan defence minister. In addition to serving as a defence minister, he is also the deputy head of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. He was accorded a very high diplomatic welcome there. It is a kind of informal recognition of the Afghan government,"" he added.

Orya expressed hopes that Qatar can play an important role in bringing Washington and Kabul together and resolving disputes between the two sides.

""Qatar is protecting America's interests in Afghanistan. This is another role that Qatar is playing in Afghanistan. Hence, Qatar can again be a good host between America and Afghanistan and a good mediator between the two countries. It can play a role in creating an understanding between America and Afghanistan.""

""Qatar has good experience in playing complicated games. In the current situation, Qatar can jointly take steps to secure the legitimate interests of the three countries. America, Qatar, and Afghanistan can identify the common grounds between the three countries and find out how to nurture and secure their common interests,"" he added.

The analyst welcomed the expansion of ties between Kabul and Doha, saying that the relationship between the two countries is getting deeper and wider every day.

""We can consider Qatar's role in Afghanistan as positive and in the interests of the people of Afghanistan and Qatari nationals,"" he asserted.

Commenting on the Afghan military official's participation at a defence expo in Doha and their efforts to modernize the Afghan army, the pundit said that Afghanistan must acquire nuclear weapons to maintain balance in the region.

""I feel that Afghanistan requires all types of modern weaponry - for ground and air purposes or air defence systems. In addition, Afghanistan would also require nuclear weapons in future. This is because, on the one hand, Iran possesses nuclear weapons; on the other hand, Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons. China also possesses nuclear weapons, Russia possesses nuclear weapons, and India possesses nuclear weapons. Hence, it would be difficult to maintain a balance,"" he said.

Attending the talk show via video call from outside Afghanistan, university lecturer and political commentator Mohammad Ishaq Atmar said, ""Doha is an important place for building a relationship between the government of the Taliban and the world.""

""Qatar wants to play a greater role in regional issues. Qatar is a country that considers itself a friend of Afghanistan,"" he stated.

Regarding the Afghan military official's visit to Qatar and their participation in the Doha defence expo, Atmar said: ""We should not forget that the ruling Taliban government is in pursuit of obtaining new weaponries. Their invitation to the international defence exhibition can prepare the ground for it.""

Atmar expressed hope that such visits could pave the ground for solving the existing disputes between the Taliban administration and the international community.

Muhammad Aurangzeb, who plans to meet with IMF officials in Washington in April, did not specify the amount that Pakistan would seek in comments to reporters in the capital, Islamabad. However, officials previously have said Pakistan wants to get up to $8 billion from the IMF over three years.","Cash-strapped Pakistan has been facing one of its worst economic crises since last year when weekly inflation at one point crossed 40% amid fears the impoverished Islamic nation could default on its payment of foreign debt.

In June 2023, the IMF approved the current, one-year $3 billion loan package to Pakistan after the country agreed to slash subsidies and raise taxes to comply with the bailout terms. Pakistan is to receive the final $1.1 billion tranche in April.

Aurangzeb said the inflation rate has since come down to 23%, and that he would seek to bring it down further, to provide some relief to residents who have struggled to pay electricity and gas bills."

Under the deal, Pakistan will receive the final tranche from the bailout that was approved by the IMF in July to save the nation from defaulting on its debt repayments.","An IMF statement said it ""has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities"" and noted that approval by the IMF's executive board “is considered a formality.”

The announcement came after talks between the IMF and the new government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif concluded in Islamabad. Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and the IMF's mission chief to Pakistan, Nathan Porter, led their teams during the talks, which began on Thursday last week.

Pakistan signed the latest short-term agreement last year to overcome one of the worst economic crises in its history that had raised fears the South Asian Islamic nation could default on the payment of foreign debts. The $3 billion bailout was signed by Sharif, who replaced former Premier Imran Khan after a no-confidence vote in parliament.

Sharif was again elected the country’s premier this month following Feb. 8 parliamentary elections.

The latest development came weeks after Khan wrote a letter to the IMF urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of the recent elections, which his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party says were rigged. Authorities have dismissed the charge as baseless.

Pakistani authorities have criticized Khan for writing the letter, saying it was a bid to harm the country's already ailing economy. Pakistan narrowly averted a default on foreign payments last summer.

In its statement on Wednesday, the IMF said “Pakistan’s economic and financial position has improved"" in recent months. However, it noted the “growth is expected to be modest this year and inflation remains well above target, and ongoing policy and reform efforts are required to address Pakistan’s deep-seated economic vulnerabilities amidst the ongoing challenges posed by elevated external and domestic financing needs and an unsettled external environment.""

The IMF said Sharif's government is committed to continue the policy efforts that started under the current bailout “to entrench economic and financial stability for the remainder of this year.""

It said Pakistani authorities are determined to take steps to further improve the country's economy by broadening the tax base, and through the timely implementation of power and gas tariff adjustments, while protecting the vulnerable through existing progressive tariff structures.

The IMF said Pakistan has also expressed interest in receiving a new bailout. Pakistan wants to seek a new bailout of up to $8 billion when the current one expires this month, it said."

Israeli media highlighted this morning the mass rallies and the partial strike that took place in Israel yesterday, saying hundreds of thousands took to the streets across the country demanding an end to the war and a release of the hostages following the cabinet's decision to take over Gaza City.

The daily Haaretz reported that the ""protest preoccupied the government and its members far more than the return of the hostages to their homes"", adding that some ministers dismissed the protests as a failure.

Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X: ""A toxic and harmful campaign"", while MK Hanoch Milwidsky called them ""riots in support of Hamas"", and Minister of Heritage Amichai Eliyahu said on X: ""Every call… to stop the fighting is another dose of oxygen for Hamas in the tunnels.""

Far-right Channel 14 focused on headlines from Arab media saying that they framed the protests as ""an internal uprising"", and a ""psychological crack in Israeli cohesion"", and a sign to the Arab world that ""Israel is split from within"".

Houthi missile intercepted by Israel after strikes on Yemen

A Houthi missile targeting Israel was reported by the army to have been intercepted yesterday afternoon, coming after Israeli naval strikes targeted Yemen's energy infrastructure earlier in the day.

The strikes hit the Haziz power station south of Houthi-controlled Sanaa, leading to a large fire and power outage, Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported yesterday.

Work to repair the damage and restore the power outage was underway, Houthi Deputy Prime Minister Mohammed Muftah said after inspecting the site.

This morning, Israel's Maariv daily said that the naval strikes were part of Israel's multi-pronged military approach to dealing with the Houthis and ""all players in the region"", which included its air force and drone technology.

Egypt and Qatar have reportedly handed Hamas a new proposal to resume the Gaza ceasefire talks.

The sources added that faction leaders urged Hamas to prepare a response to the proposal ""within the coming hours"", according to the website.

This comes as Israel prepares for a large-scale operation to control Gaza City, including plans to relocate residents of the city to the southern Gaza Strip.

Egyptian, Palestinian PMs discuss developments in Gaza

Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has received his Palestinian counterpart Mohammed Mustafa in the Egyptian coastal city of Alamein, where they discussed developments in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

Madbouly stressed Egypt's commitment to the unity of the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the leadership of the Palestinian Authority, according to a Facebook statement posted yesterday by the Egyptian cabinet.

The Palestinian prime minister is set to visit the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza today, according to Sky News Arabia.

The visit will include inspecting the Egyptian Red Crescent's logistics centre for aid to review the mechanism of the humanitarian operation.

Egypt reiterates rejection of Israeli plans to displace Palestinians

Egypt has reiterated its rejection of any Israeli plans to displace Palestinians in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank after reports of Israeli negotiations with some countries to receive Palestinians displaced from Gaza.

The Egyptian foreign ministry said in a Facebook statement yesterday that it made communications with those countries which ""confirmed their rejection of such denounced plans"".

The ministry emphasised Egypt's ""categorical rejection"" of any Israeli plans to displace Palestinians ""whether voluntarily or by force through policies of starvation, confiscating lands, settlements and making life impossible in Palestinian territories"".

It stressed that Egypt will neither accept displacement nor participate in it, describing it as a ""historical injustice that has no moral or legal justification"".

Hundreds of Bedouin fighters reject secession calls by protesters in Syria's Suweida

Protests in Syria's restive southern province of Suweida (also Sweida) on 16 August calling for secession drew condemnation from Bedouin tribes and fighters, Syrian media reported yesterday.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that ""hundreds of fighters"" from tribes of southern Syria had gathered in Rakham, a village in Deraa province near Suweida, to denounce the calls.

Meanwhile, the pro-government Zaman al-Wasl website reported yesterday that tribes ""displaced"" from recent clashes in Suweida had condemned the presence of Israeli flags at the protest, blaming ""militias led by Hajri"" - a reference to controversial Druze cleric Hikmat al-Hajri.

The latest comes after Suweida witnessed a wave of deadly sectarian violence in mid-July between Druze factions, local Bedouin tribes and Syrian government forces.

Suicide explosion reported in Aleppo, no casualties

A suicide bomber detonated his belt outside a bakery in the northern Syrian commercial hub city of Aleppo yesterday afternoon, with no casualties reported.

Halab TV reported that the assailant detonated the belt near the Al-Wahda bakery in the central Al-Maysar neighbourhood, while a leading war monitor said the incident in front of a bakery ""raised many questions"" as to the motive.

It comes after a car explosion was reported in the western Damascus neighbourhood of Mezzeh on 16 August, also causing no injuries, state news agency Sana reported. Specialised units combed the area to ensure the safety of citizens and prevent any potential acts of terrorism, a security official told Sana.

Syria has been grappling with violence targeting minorities over recent months. In June, a suicide bombing at the Mar Elias church in Damascus killed at least 25 people and wounded over 60.

Jordan to fast-track national military service plans following announcement

Jordanian media prominently reported the announcement yesterday by Crown Prince Al Hussein Bin Abdullah that national military service would be re-activated ""soon"".

Responding to the decision, Prime Minister Jaafar Hassan said that the plans would be fast-tracked and that the government would immediately begin with the necessary executive and legislative procedures to reactivate mandatory service, the kingdom's popular Roya TV channel said last night.

Hassan announced the allocation of funds to begin preparations for the programme which is expected to begin early next year, the channel reported.

The latest announcement comes amid mounting regional tensions in view of Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza, its latest settlement expansion announcement, the freezing of church funds in Jerusalem, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ""Greater Israel Vision"" remarks last week, which were condemned across the region, including in Jordan.

Lebanese president tells Al Arabiya 'Iran will not interfere' domestically

Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has reiterated his message that Iran will not interfere in internal Lebanese affairs, in an interview broadcast yesterday on pan-Arab Al Arabiya TV.

Aoun told the channel that he had informed top Iranian security official Ali Larijani last week that Beirut-Tehran relations are ""based on respect"" but that ""our message is clear, Iran will not interfere"".

He stressed that restricting Hezbollah's arms was a ""Lebanese decision and does not concern Iran"" and that the US paper presented by envoy Thomas Barrack included an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and a plan to revitalise the Lebanese economy, Al Arabiya reported.

The remarks coincide with intense public and political debate in Lebanon over the country's ability to deter near-daily Israeli attacks upon Hezbollah's disarmament. The group has rejected calls for it to disarm."

BBCSAP0020240321ek3l002bd,"Pakistan's Dunya TV show on IMF deal, signs of improvement in economy","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Dunya Kamran Khan Kay Saath"" (World With Kamran Khan), hosted by senior journalist and TV host Kamran Khan on moderate Dunya News TV in Urdu at 16:30 GMT on 20 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Anchor Kamran Khan said a staff-level agreement between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan was signed on 19 March after a final review of the standby arrangement. He added the IMF's confidence in Pakistan's steps for economic revival seems to be growing and noted it is a result of the steps taken under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) during the caretaker government's tenure. He mentioned exports, large-scale manufacturing, agriculture, remittances and foreign investment have increased in the last few months, with exports increasing by 9 per cent in the current fiscal year.","Khan asked journalist Shahbaz Rana about the government's preparations for acquiring a new IMF programme. Rana said an element of uncertainty in the economy has been reduced in the last nine months and reports about a possible default are not being heard anymore. He explained the reason behind it is that an ""umbrella"" of the IMF is available to Pakistan. He noted since the previous IMF programme had failed, there was a lack of confidence in Pakistan, which has now decreased.

Rana noted Pakistan had achieved a ""phase of stability"" earlier as well but governments started taking political decisions after that. However, he said, the situation this time would be different because all stakeholders and foreign players having interest in Pakistan's economy have said this is the ""last chance for Pakistan"" and there is ""no room for mistakes"". He was of the view that in the next programme, the IMF would want Pakistan to reform its power sector so that the cost of electricity can be reduced.

Khan spoke with former finance minister Miftah Ismail and asked him to share his views on the current signs of improvement in the economy. Ismail said several good things have taken place, for example, cotton crop has been very good this year. However, he added, there have been problems in some sectors as the government has massively increased gas and electricity prices and it is affecting the industries. He noted it has been proven that things can improve if focused measures like controlling the Afghan Transit Trade and stopping illegal transfer of foreign exchange are taken. He was of the view that the IMF agreement for release of the third tranche is ""very encouraging"" and Pakistan would be able to smoothly go into the next three-year programme.

Khan spoke with Imtiaz Gadar, an expert on economic affairs, and asked him why the stock market is cautious even though the economy has started showing signs of improvement. Gadar said the market has certainly taken a ""cautious stance"" because it probably wants to see some of the things materialise. He noted the IMF programme prioritises stability and then moves towards growth. He expressed the view that if Pakistan goes into a long-term IMF programme, a ""built-in discount in the economy"" that Pakistan's external position is very weak would change, and the country can work towards growth in the second phase of the programme. Commenting on the SIFC as a platform for multiple stakeholders in the economy, he emphasised the results would certainly be good if all stakeholders are on the same page and work for combined objectives in the economy.

Ismail insisted the interest rate should be reduced. Noting that the current prices of Pakistan's bonds are at the ""highest in two years"", he said this indicates that ""the world is happy that Pakistan is going in the right direction"" and investors have greater confidence in Pakistani bonds.

Khan commented China is one of Pakistan's most important friends and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (mega development project) is to be ""revitalised"", but at the same time, the United States (US) is also important to Pakistan. He asked Ismail how Pakistan can strike a balance between China and the US in economic matters. Ismail said Pakistan can neither leave China, nor the US. He mentioned China is Pakistan's ""biggest single country lender"" and most of the electricity in Pakistan is being generated due to its support. He added at the same time, the US and Western Europe are the biggest buyers of Pakistani exports.

Ismail was of the view that Pakistan needs to take China and the US along simultaneously, which is a very ""delicate"" task and is not easy. He said the situation would get better and a balance between China and the US would be maintained if Pakistan starts collecting more taxes and stands on its own feet. He remarked a country as big as Pakistan needs to maintain friendly relations with all the countries.

The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Talks with IMF","Anchor Shahzad Raza said an International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation will start talks with Pakistan on 14 March regarding a standby agreement and the country is expected to get the last tranche of $1.1bn from the IMF under the agreement. He noted Pakistan now has a new government and a new economic team under Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb will be holding talks with the IMF delegation. He added after this review, Pakistan will have to go into another IMF programme.

Raza spoke with Dr Khaqan Hassan Najeeb, an expert on economic affairs, and asked him for his views on the prospect of talks with the IMF. Najeeb said he has constantly been saying that leaving the IMF would be an action that would put Pakistan in ""more discomfort"" and it is good that the new government has realised this. He noted the standby agreement is an ""interim arrangement"" that enables Pakistan to acquire bilateral, multilateral and commercial funds. He mentioned the country would be going into the 24th IMF programme but 21 of those programmes have remained incomplete.

Najeeb remarked it is not an IMF programme but ""Pakistan's programme which is being financed by a lender [IMF]"". He noted Pakistan got IMF funding in the past for some ""breathing room"" but did not implement ""deeper reforms"" due to which the economy could not stabilise.

Raza spoke with Dr Shimail Daud, former president of the Rawalpindi Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and asked him why the country's economic challenges have grown after 2018. Daud replied continuity of policy was not maintained due to the changing governments. He said governments avoided taking tough decisions to implement reforms because it led to a ""political fallout"". He added those governments tried making ""populist decisions"" and giving excessive subsidies. He was of the view that such wrong actions were continuously ""stacked"" and problems kept growing.

Daud commented the IMF tries to ""discipline"" the economy, but as soon as the government gives up that discipline, it loses the steps forward. He added that is why issues in the economy have remained unresolved, like loss-making enterprises not being privatised, circular debt increasing and tax to gross domestic product ratio continuing to be low. He was of the view that the leadership should take people into confidence that tough measures are not wrong decisions but necessary corrective steps. He insisted ""belt-tightening"" is needed in the coming years.

Suggesting some reforms to improve the economy, Najeeb said Pakistan needs to reduce the size of the federal government to control its expenditures. He added the country needs to stop unnecessary subsidies and pensions should not be state-funded.

Raza contacted Haroon Sharif, former chairperson of the Board of Investment, and asked him whether pending mega projects like the oil refinery by Saudi Arabia, revival of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (mega development project), and the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline could materialise now since an elected government with a ""clear-cut agenda"" is in place. Sharif replied these projects have remained pending for several years and that is because ""macro-economic vulnerabilities"" of governments impacted the flow of foreign investment. He noted Pakistan's risk on external payments has remained high. He was of the view that the government should facilitate ""relatively smaller investment deals for the private sector"" besides focusing on the mega projects. He emphasised Pakistan needs to reduce the cost of doing business and increase the ease of doing business.

Upcoming elections in India

Talking about the upcoming Indian elections, Raza said it looks like the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to win elections with an ""anti-Muslim"" and ""nationalist Hindu"" sentiment. He asked political analyst Raza Muhammad Khan to share his views on the BJP's election campaign which isolates a large part of the population, which is non-Hindu, from the system. Khan replied the BJP's election formula is a ""tested one"" as it has helped the party win elections twice but it is also a ""very dangerous formula"".

Khan claimed the economy or good governance have no role in the BJP's election campaign and it aims to ""divide people on the basis of religion, hatred towards Muslims in India and Kashmir, and hatred against Pakistan"". He added it degrades other minorities like the Sikhs and Dalits. He remarked it looks like the BJP is not bothered about alienating a large population of Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs and others.

The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Nadeem Malik said a court in Rawalpindi has issued non-bailable warrants of the arrest for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. He noted the warrants have been issued in connection to the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PTI). He remarked issuing arrest warrants against a sitting chief minister is an ""unusual step"" and it is to be seen what ""fallout"" this step would have on the political scenario in Pakistan.","Malik noted negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have entered the ""final round"" and it is expected that a letter of intent would be issued by the night of 19 March. He said an arrangement with the IMF is important for Pakistan to fill the gap in its ""balance of payments"" as other countries and institutions which gave loans to Pakistan have agreed to extend their support once the country is in an IMF programme. He mentioned Pakistan not only needs the last tranche of the current programme, but also wants to enter into a larger programme for three to four years.

Malik further noted inflation is not likely to decrease because under the IMF's conditions, the interest rate should be kept high, value of the rupee should be flexible, and power and gas tariffs should be increased.

Interview with minister of planning

Malik spoke with Minister of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal and asked him for how long the economy of Pakistan would remain weak. Iqbal said the current economic situation of the economy is certainly very challenging. He remarked it is not an underdeveloped economy, but an ""under-managed or mismanaged economy"" that can start a journey towards robust growth and development if its resources are used properly. He noted the main issue with Pakistan is its ""political instability"" because of which economic policies have been ""reversed and disbanded"" repeatedly. He emphasised political stability and continuity along with right economic policies could lead to economic progress.

Malik remarked a ""civil-military dialogue"" is necessary so that the military establishment stops ""experiments"" of intervention to install people of its choice for managing the economy. Iqbal was of the view that there is a realisation [within the military establishment] that continuity is necessary and the objective of the Special Investment Facilitation Council is to end tension and mistrust and take decisions with everyone's ownership in a ""whole of government approach"". He said there is need for an ""economic National Action Plan"" on the same lines as the National Action Plan against terrorism which was devised with a consensus from all.

Iqbal termed the meeting between KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif a ""very positive development"". Talking about Gandapur's arrest warrants, he said it may be a part of the judicial process and hoped that it would not cause any disruption that would increase political confrontation. He commented the people of Pakistan will not support any kind of ""negative politics"" in the current scenario. He expressed confidence that an agreement with the IMF would be finalised soon.

Arrest warrants against Gandapur

Malik asked KP government's spokesperson Muhammad Ali Saif about his reaction to the arrest warrants against Gandapur. Saif said it is a ""routine action"" and not a big legal or political issue as issuing bailable or non-bailable warrants during case proceedings is a normal procedure under the criminal procedure code. He claimed the Punjab government ""does not want to miss any opportunity to exploit an issue against PTI members"", so it would keep highlighting this issue.

Saif said the PTI would like to get the problems of KP resolved through dialogue with a ""positive mind"" and that is why Gandapur held a meeting with the prime minister. However, he added, it cannot be a one-sided process and the other side should also reciprocate.

Replying to Malik's question on why the KP government is demanding that Imran Khan (PTI founder) should be handed over to it from the Adiala jail in Punjab, Saif said the Punjab government has been saying that there are threats to jails in Punjab, which is a ""pretext to disallow people from meeting Khan"". He added if Khan is not safe in one of the largest jails of Punjab, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should hand him over to the KP government.

The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Nadeem Malik said a case regarding harassment of journalists was heard by the Supreme Court on 11 March and noted Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa gave ""very apt remarks"" on the issue. He added Chief Justice Isa, however, did not pass any order for release of the arrested journalist Asad Toor or for arresting the people involved in journalist Matiullah Jan's abduction and shooting at Absar Alam, who were visible in the CCTV footage. He remarked it is unfortunate that the family of slain journalist Arshad Sharif is still awaiting justice.","Malik noted President Asif Ali Zardari and a new federal cabinet have taken oath. He said the present government has taken over at a time when Pakistan is facing serious challenges and continues to be in a state of ""economic collapse"". He mentioned the rupee has depreciated massively and there seems no chance of any improvement in the situation. He added the country needs financing of around $30bn and will have to seek funding from friendly countries like China, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.

Malik further said the present government is a ""minority government"" which would be dependent on the support of its coalition partners and would also need backing from the military establishment all the time.

Malik spoke with Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was previously associated with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), and asked him whether the present government would be able to address the problems of the country. Abbasi said he wishes for the government to meet the challenge but it does not seem likely that it would be able to do so. He noted the people in the new cabinet are the same people who were a part of the previous government and they ""do not seem to have the ability to respond to challenges"".

Abbasi emphasised the government will have to go for a ""broader engagement"" politically and talk to all the stakeholders. Replying to a question on whether Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should contact former prime minister Imran Khan, he said Sharif should politically contact everyone, including Khan. He added Sharif should take everyone into confidence about the challenges faced by the country and seek support on the steps taken by the government to address the challenges. He was of the view that the confidence of investors cannot be restored without ending the current political polarisation.

Abbasi noted questions have been raised on the recent elections and Chief Justice Isa should play a role in resolving these issues. He said the Supreme Court has suo moto powers in matters related to elections and it is a serious issue which should be investigated and settled. Speaking about the issue of reserved seats, he said the Sunni Ittehad Council did not present a list of its candidates for the seats reserved for women and minorities, but these seats cannot be distributed to other political parties.

Malik contacted former finance minister Miftah Ismail and asked him whether he agrees with the view that the new cabinet lacks the competence to address the issues faced by Pakistan. Ismail said he is ""glad"" that Muhammad Aurangzeb has been made the Minister of Finance and former finance minister Ishaq Dar has not been given the portfolio again. He was of the view that had it been Dar, an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have been very difficult. He remarked Aurangzeb is a ""very competent"" person.

Ismail noted rest of the cabinet members did not deliver during the previous government, so there is little hope from them that they would perform well now. Speaking about the election results, he alleged Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Salman Akram Raja had won the election but Awn Chaudhry from the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) was declared the winner. He said he refuses to believe that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif really won the election in Lahore.

Abbasi refused to comment on the issue of election results and insisted that the Supreme Court should look into it.

On Malik's question whether Imran Khan should be released from jail, Ismail said he does not believe that Khan or anyone else should be released because they got votes. However, he added, if the court gives him relief through the process of law, it would be fine. He recalled Khan's government sent many of his political opponents to jail without any reason.

Malik asked Abbasi whether he is planning to form a new political party. Abbasi said he would launch a party because ""all three main political parties [PML-N, PTI and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)] have failed to respond to the real issues of the country"". He was of the view that political parties should focus on national issues instead of levelling allegations on their opponents.

Ismail said he would not join a new party if it approves of dynastic politics and he would want a party which aims to bring improvement to the country and the people.

BBCSAP0020240305ek350005l,Pakistan's PTV show interviews former minister of energy Khurram Dastgir,"The following is a summary of the talk show ""Riasat"" (The State), hosted by anchor Shahzad Raza on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 4 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Anchor Shahzad Raza interviewed Khurram Dastgir, a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician and former minister of energy, who lost the recent national elections.","Raza asked Dastgir why he lost the election even after showing an ""excellent performance"" as a minister during the previous government.&#160;Dastgir said the election did not seem to be tough during the campaign but on the election day, and even after that, several incidents took place against which he has been seeking a ""legal recourse"".

Responding to Raza's question on why he could not resolve the issues in the power sector as the minister, Dastgir said the previous government made huge progress in power generation by adding 5,000 megawatts to the system. He added the government also improved the power transmission system and new technology was introduced in distribution to stop power theft. He noted the power sector circular debt, which was 2,500bn rupees ($8.9bn) under the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, was reduced to 2,300bn rupees ($8.2bn).

Dastgir said consumers assess the performance through electricity bills and the bills had increased after an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He was of the view that the biggest challenge for the incoming government would be to reduce electricity bills and give relief to the people. He noted during the 16 months of the PML-N-led government, several measures were taken and he is hopeful that the next government would move forward in this regard. He remarked he would be ready to provide ""guidance and assistance"" to the new government.

Speaking about the government's policy on alternate energy, Dastgir said the government already has a plan to ""immediately add 10,000 megawatts of solar energy to the power system"". He noted solar energy is much cheaper but is ""not a solution to all the issues"", yet a major relief could be provided to the people in the next two or three years.

Talking about the payment of independent power producers (IPPs), Dastgir said the initial contracts or the capacity payment agreements of many of the IPPs which had started working during the 1990s would expire in the next two or three years, freeing the country of a ""major burden"". He noted the two big dams which are under construction would be completed by 2026 or 2027 and more hydro power would be available. He expressed hope that in the next five or six years, the situation would be far better and the government might be in a position to provide relief to the people.

Dastgir claimed the issue of electricity theft in several areas is a ""governance crisis more than an electricity crisis"" and said prime minister-elect Shehbaz Sharif's government will have to work on the issue. He mentioned the previous government which was in power for only 16 months had made a plan for solar cell manufacturing, battery manufacturing and converting petrol-consuming two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles to alternate energy, and said the new government could implement the plan immediately.

On the political situation, Dastgir said he does not see the opposition as a ""big challenge"" because it threatens the government of blocking legislation in the parliament but that is an issue of ""temporary management"" and ""cannot create hurdles in governance"". He added the opposition cannot obstruct the government from delivering to the people of Pakistan.

Speaking about Shehbaz Sharif's call for a ""charter of reconciliation"", Dastgir said the PML-N is always ready for reconciliation with all parties, but there is one ""red line"" and that is the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of the then-chairperson Imran Khan). He added the ""planners, abettors and executors"" of the 9 May attacks will have to face the law in its ""strictest sense"" because the state cannot tolerate another attack. However, he said, if there are people who have been imprisoned but were not involved in the incidents, they would certainly be released. He argued the issue is that the opposition has declared all its opponents ""traitors and infidels"". He commented the opposition should ""show maturity"" in the parliament and Shehbaz Sharif would be ready to shake hands with everyone.

Dastgir said the new government would also face a big ""communication challenge"" as it would have to tell the nation the truth on how big the challenges are and how it would address them. Noting that ""no one listens to press conferences now"" and interest in watching TV talk shows is also declining, he suggested communication through mobile phones would be needed to inform the people about the issues, programmes and achievements.

BBCSAP0020240325ek3p0005l,"Pakistan's Dawn TV show on political uncertainty, economy","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Khabar Se Khabar"" (From News to News), hosted by anchor Nadia Mirza on liberal Dawn News TV in Urdu at 17:00 GMT on 24 March 2024. Mirza discusses important political and foreign policy issues with experts and politicians.

Political instability","Anchor Nadia Mirza remarked the government seems to be unsure about whether it would be able to complete its term. She noted Rana Sanaullah, a senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician, recently commented that appointment of Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi is a ""guarantee for the government's survival"".

Mirza noted it is for the first time in the history of Pakistan that stability and sustainability of a newly formed government are said to be dependent on the appointment of certain personalities as finance and interior ministers. She asked senior journalist Amir Zia to comment on the situation. Zia said the [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif-led government apparently seems quite strong but not only its opponents, but also the people inside the government keep asking whether it would be able to complete its tenure. He added the present government represents ""unity in diversity"" but there are ""competing interests"" at work against each other within it.

Zia criticised a statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs Ishaq Dar that trade relations with India should be restored and commented there are ""no takers of peace in India"" and the election campaign there is based on an ""anti-Pakistan"" sentiment. He added Pakistan's ""stated stance"" is that talks with India are not possible till the latter annuls its steps taken on 5 August 2019 regarding the status of Kashmir.

Zia was of the view that the finance minister should be empowered, but ""unfortunately whenever a technocrat is appointed to the position, he does not get political support"". He mentioned Aurangzeb has close links with the Sharif family, yet he is ""not being fully trusted"". He insisted Dar should have nothing to do with the finance ministry, and if Aurangzeb is not allowed to work freely, it would be unfair to Pakistan.

Talking about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's future in politics, Zia said his politics suffered a ""setback"" in the 8 February elections and it is to be seen whether his daughter and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would be able to revive the politics launched by him and win the power tussle within the Sharif family. He claimed Maryam Nawaz's actions are being ""overly publicised"".

Speaking about the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Zia said the party is facing ""very complex problems"" but it does not look like the government can take advantage of the issues within the party.

Politics within PTI

Mirza said the PTI is facing internal issues because Imran Khan (PTI founder) is in jail and there are restrictions on the party's activities. She noted on 23 March, PTI politician Sher Afzal Marwat revealed that dissidents in his party have formed a forward group in the Punjab Assembly, but several other party members have denied the reports of division within the PTI.

Mirza contacted Marwat and asked him whether he stands firm on his statement or will he take a U-turn. Marwat commented he never takes a U-turn on his statements. He claimed his statement was based on information shared by several ""responsible members"" in a party meeting and statement of the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly. He was of the view that it would be good if PTI politicians in the parliamentary party have control over the members of the assemblies.

Marwat emphasised the PTI should focus on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab Assembly during the Senate (upper house of the parliament) elections because many ""powerful people"" would be contesting as independent candidates. He said the PTI should try to win at least nine Senate seats from KP and two from Punjab.

Economy

Mirza asked economist Shahid Hasan Siddiqui whether the new finance minister would be able to improve Pakistan's economy. Siddiqui said it is for sure that loans would be granted to Pakistan but the economy would further weaken. He added if the same policies continue after the 24th International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, Pakistan would have to go into a 25th programme as well because there is a ""nexus of Pakistani and foreign elite"" who want these policies to continue. He was of the view that the United States (US) wants Pakistan to remain in the IMF programme for its political interests and the Pakistani elite want to continue the IMF programme to ""please the US"" and increase the tax burden on people under the cover of the IMF. He noted the government has not offered any new suggestions since 2001 for expanding the tax net and noted the tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has declined in the last few years.

BBCSAP0020240307ek370018h,"Pakistan's Dunya TV show on PTI's politics, relations with other countries","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Dunya Kamran Khan Kay Saath"" (World With Kamran Khan), hosted by senior journalist and TV host Kamran Khan on moderate Dunya News TV in Urdu at 16:30 GMT on 6 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

PTI's politics","Anchor Kamran Khan said just like in 2013, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has once again become the ruling party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and an opposition party in the rest of Pakistan. He remarked Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) has to decide whether his party would continue the politics of resistance. He claimed the PTI has adopted an ""aggressive attitude"" and its decision to appoint Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief minister of KP indicates that it has ""initiated an aggressive political innings"".

Khan contacted PTI politician Ali Mohammad Khan and asked him whether the PTI has decided to continue its aggressive politics. Ali Khan said the most important thing is that the mandate given to the party in elections should be accepted. He added Imran Khan does not want the party to remain in an ""aggressive or battling position"" all the time, but protests will continue till it gets its ""right"". He mentioned Imran Khan spoke with him about ""truth and reconciliation"" and said everyone will have to tell the truth. He questioned whether Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would accept that he lost the election and came into power with a ""fake mandate"".

Ali Khan said the people of KP voted for the PTI for a third term because it had performed well. He remarked his party does not accept Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister and that is why Gandapur has been made the chief minister of KP and he did not attend the prime minister's oath-taking ceremony. He mentioned Gandapur will perform his state duties but would continue to protest till the party's ""rights"" are given to it.

Relations with other countries

Khan spoke with senior political analyst Husain Haqqani and asked him whether he would agree that the world is not concerned about the issues in elections in Pakistan and wants cordial relations with the new government. Haqqani fully agreed with the view and said it has happened nowhere in the world that governments of other countries have refused to recognise a government after an election. He remarked it is a result of ""political immaturity and lack of understanding"" of international relations that PTI politicians were expecting that upon their expression of reservations about elections, foreign countries would not accept the new government.

Khan asked Haqqani to comment on the congratulatory messages given to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after his election. Haqqani said while messages are a formal activity, the swiftness with which these messages were conveyed in the context of a controversial election proves that all countries want Pakistan to be a stable country. He added Pakistan's stability is in the interest of all countries which have given loans to it. Talking about India, he said it is in a position of an ""economic take off"" and confrontation with Pakistan is an ""irritant"" for it. Therefore, he added, all countries want to engage with Pakistan and improve relations with it.

Replying to Khan's question on how Pakistan can maintain a balance in its relations with China and the United States (US) simultaneously, Haqqani said at present all countries in the world are in search of a ""balanced foreign policy"", and the far eastern countries have recently said that they want relations with both China and the US and would not want to get involved in any conflict between the two countries. He insisted Pakistan will also need to adopt this ""sagacious attitude"" and ""detach emotions from foreign policy"".

Speaking about the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) programme, Haqqani said Pakistan had to seek loans from the IMF repeatedly because it did not follow the IMF's conditions which were aimed at reforming its economy. He added Pakistan should complete an IMF programme to achieve economic stability. Talking about the need for internal political stability, he insisted ""national reconciliation"" is necessary and if there is no internal harmony, Pakistan will not be able to have any reconciliation or negotiations with other countries.

Haqqani said restoration of Pakistan's relations with the US at the highest level have begun and noted US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken held meetings with Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir during his visit to Washington. He expressed confidence in US Vice President Kamala Harris contacting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the near future. He claimed under Imran Khan's government, there was an issue that nothing was kept confidential. He remarked in ""populism"", the leader wants to say everything which can earn an applause from the public but in diplomacy, ""many things have to be done quietly"".

Replying to Khan's question on whether the US policy towards Pakistan would change if Donald Trump (former US president) or the Republican party comes into office after the November elections, Haqqani said the US foreign policy is based on national interest and not on personalities, so a change in government may not bring any major change in the foreign policy.

BBCSAP0020240326ek3q0015p,"Pakistan's Geo TV show on differences within political parties, cipher case","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath"" (Today With Shahzeb Khanzada), hosted by anchor Shahzeb Khanzada on liberal, pro-PML-N Geo News TV in Urdu at 17:00 GMT on 25 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Issues in coalition government","Anchor Shahzeb Khanzada said running a coalition government and putting the economy back on track is a major challenge for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He noted questions have been raised about the powers of the finance minister as well as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's decisions and his ""quick U-turn"" on those decisions. He said reportedly differences exist within the PML-N regarding appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as the finance minister. He added when Aurangzeb was appointed as the finance minister, instead of giving him the chairmanship of committees linked to important economic matters, the prime minister decided to keep them with himself or other PML-N senior members. He mentioned after criticism of this decision, chairmanship of one committee was given to the finance minister.

Khanzada spoke with journalist Shehbaz Rana and asked him why there are issues in appointing the heads of committees. Rana said in the decision to appoint Aurangzeb as the finance minister, the prime minister had a major role to play, even more than the military establishment. He noted under former finance minister Ishaq Dar, targets of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme were not achieved and that is why it was continuously being said that Dar would not be made the finance minister again. However, he added, due to pressure from a camp within the PML-N, Dar was given some role in economic management by giving him positions in some of the committees.

Rana was of the view that Pakistan needs to provide ""united support"" to the finance minister so that ""hard negotiations"" with the IMF for a new programme can be held.

Alleged division within PTI

Khanzada said elections for 48 seats of the Senate (upper house of the parliament) would be held on 2 April and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has claimed that it would win two seats from Punjab. He added the PTI has alleged that its members in Punjab are being pressurised into changing their party loyalty.

Khanzada asked PML-N politician Rana Sanaullah whether his party is trying to influence PTI members in the Punjab Assembly to form a ""forward bloc"". Sanaullah said the PTI has got ""strange kind of people elected to the assemblies"" who are destroying the party. He referred to a statement by PTI politician Sher Afzal Marwat, who claimed 40 members of the PTI parliamentary party in the Punjab Assembly have changed their party loyalty, and commented it is not easy to influence 40 members to change their political affiliation and no one is trying to win over their loyalties.

Sanaullah said Aurangzeb's appointment as the finance minister was a decision by the prime minister and noted that it has helped the government successfully complete talks with the IMF for the last tranche of the standby programme. He remarked since this is a coalition government, the PML-N has to accept certain ""compromises"". He commented the PML-N is not desperate to remain in power, but is ""desperate to make this government successful"". He mentioned he was not in favour of the PML-N forming a government in the centre but the party took the final decision of making its government. He added Shehbaz Sharif has accommodated demands of all the parties in the coalition.

Scandal surrounding new federal minister

Khanzada reported on a recent scandal regarding ""misuse of political authority"", involving newly appointed federal minister Ahad Cheema and Punjab Governor Baligh ur Rehman, due to which principal of the prestigious Aitchison College of Lahore had to resign. He said Cheema and Rehman changed a policy of the college to benefit the former's children. He spoke with Cheema and sought an explanation from him. Cheema claimed the policy was changed by Rehman for the benefit of all the students, and not just his children.

Cipher case

Khanzada reported on a hearing of former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign affairs minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's appeal in the Islamabad High Court against their conviction in the cipher case. He cited remarks of the judges and arguments of the counsels. He mentioned the hearing has been adjourned till 26 March.

BBCSAP0020240318ek3i000gp,Pakistan's Dawn TV show on issues surrounding ex-PM Khan's party,"The following is a summary of the talk show ""Khabar Se Khabar"" (From News to News), hosted by anchor Nadia Mirza on liberal Dawn News TV in Urdu at 17:00 GMT on 17 March 2024. Mirza discusses important political and foreign policy issues with experts and politicians.

Anchor Nadia Mirza remarked after a period of ""instability"" for 16 months, it was being hoped that political and economic stability would return after elections, but all those hopes have been ""dashed to the ground"" because the recent polls were ""the most controversial elections in the history of Pakistan"". She noted protests were started on streets and also inside the parliament after elections. She said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has claimed that it will not let the parliament and government function, raising concerns over how talks would be held with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and how economic challenges would be handled.","Mirza further noted for the first time in the history of Pakistan, the Senate (upper house of the parliament) has been ""practically inactive"" as its elections are to be held on 9 or 11 April.

Mirza contacted Imran Ismail, former governor of Sindh and an estranged member of the PTI, and asked him about his activities after leaving the party and quitting politics. Ismail said leaving politics was difficult as he had been affiliated with Imran Khan (PTI founder) since 1993. He added after leaving politics, he has been focusing on his business and family.

Responding to a question on whether he would go back to the PTI, Ismail said political conditions are very difficult for the party at the moment and several of its members are in jail. He added he does not know who is managing the party right now, so he will think about it later, but he is currently not planning on returning to politics.

Ismail said he believes the PTI is a good political party and not a ""terrorist party"". He added it is a party which stands with the military and other institutions like the judiciary. He claimed no government in Pakistan can work ""without the support of institutions"", and as long as the PTI was in power, it enjoyed full support from the Army and other institutions of the military. He remarked it is very encouraging for a government to ""remain on the same page as the military"".

Ismail mentioned after a vote of no-confidence against the PTI government in the centre, he resigned from the governorship of Sindh because he felt he could not get along with the new government. He was of the view that former president Arif Alvi should also have resigned if he was ""unable to work freely"".

Ismail strongly condemned an alleged negative social media campaign against military personnel martyred a few days back and called the people involved in it ""criminals of the nation"". He said he decided to leave the PTI after the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of Imran Khan).

Mirza asked senior journalist Muhammad Malick about politicians in the PTI feeling that the party has been ""hijacked by lawyers"". Malick said Khan gave party tickets to a large number of lawyers before elections, thinking that lawyers would not be disqualified and the courts would also be lenient towards them. He noted the PTI stands divided into four to five factions at the moment as there is a ""communication gap"" between the party and Khan since he is in jail.

Malick was of the view that the issue of reserved seats is not important because the PTI will not be able to form its government even if it gets those seats in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament). He remarked the issue is between two individuals: Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir. He added if these two individuals ""take two steps back and reach big decisions"", things would become better for the PTI. He predicted some relief would gradually be given to the PTI, but not to Khan.

Talking about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur's meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Malick said it should not be seen as ""defiance"" to Khan. He added the two would continue to meet in future as well because they are constitutional office holders.

The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Muneeb Farooq announced former president Asif Ali Zardari got re-elected and took oath as the 14th President of Pakistan. He noted meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has given a call for a countrywide protest against what it claims to be a ""theft"" of its mandate. He said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur (PTI member) led the protest in Peshawar and the police launched a crackdown on protesters and several PTI members were arrested. He questioned whether the crackdown was initiated because the protests were against the law.","Farooq spoke with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Azma Bokhari and asked her why the government arrested PTI protesters. Bokhari said people did not come out in support of the PTI and there were hardly 25 people in the protest. She claimed no one was arrested and argued no government could allow blocking of roads and causing inconvenience to the public.

PTI politician Nadeem Qureshi claimed on 8 February (polling day), the entire nation rejected the parties which have formed the government. He said the government took action because it was ""scared"" of the protesters. He alleged several people were arrested during the protest and questioned why the government deployed a large police force if people did not come out to join the PTI's protest.

Farooq said many things have changed in Pakistani politics and a lot is still changing. He asked journalist Mujibur Rahman Shami whether Zardari's election and presidency with full support from the PML-N indicate that ""things have been stitched up so well that [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif's government will survive for a full five-year term"". Shami said at the moment it seems that the government will remain intact but nothing can be said with certainty about Pakistani politics in which ""any government can derail any time"". He added Sharif and Zardari are both ""champions of reconciliation"" and ""signs"" indicate that the arrangement would be sustainable.

Senior journalist Muhammad Malick claimed it is true that the election was ""stolen"" and if that had not happened, a leader of another party would have been there in the prime minister's house. He said the PML-N government is dependent on support from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and noted the latter is in the ""most comfortable position"". He was of the view that the PPP decided to not join the cabinet because it knew the government would have to take very tough actions, particularly after an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He remarked the first year of the government would be ""very crucial"".

On Farooq's question whether Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) could get some relief in the coming months, Malick said no relief is likely to be given immediately as ""the [military] establishment has formed the government"" and Khan is out of power except for in one province [KP]. He added Khan is not in a position to ""publicly soften his stance"" because that would damage his support base.

Farooq asked Shami to comment on the PTI's protest which was not joined by many people but several PTI members were still arrested in Punjab. Shami said political governments cannot afford a ""policy of arrests and victimisation"" and those who had adopted such a policy in the past eventually lost power. He insisted Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should not follow former caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi's policy because the latter was a caretaker and was not going to contest elections, but the former is a ""political representative of the people"".

The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Easing political tensions","Anchor Kamran Khan said Pakistani politics has witnessed a ""very pleasing scene"" after many years which indicates a ""significant decrease"" in the country's ""political temperature"". He noted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a ""pleasant meeting"" on 13 March. He mentioned after the meeting, Gandapur expressed the resolve to play a positive role in the interest of the country and the two leaders agreed to work together to solve the issues of the country.

Khan spoke with senior journalist Iftikhar Firdous and asked him to comment on the unexpected development. Firdous said this was ""unprecedented"" and noted ever since Gandapur took oath, tension had prevailed between KP and the centre. He noted the meeting was held at the request of the KP government.

Firdous said the ""inside story"" is that a meeting of the Special Investment Facilitation Council has been called on 14 March in which chief ministers of all the four provinces would be present. He remarked it was necessary to settle certain issues of KP with the federal government, particularly those about the economic stability of the province and the security situation. He added there are dues which the federal government has to pay to the province for security and repayment of loans. He noted if the funds are released, it would be the second government after 2008 which would pay arrears to the province. He agreed with Khan that Imran Khan (former chairperson of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PTI) was ""in loop"" about the meeting.

Foreign policy challenges

Khan said Ishaq Dar from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has been appointed as the foreign minister in the new government. He mentioned Dar has no experience in foreign ministry and his appointment is being termed ""interesting"" by serving and retired diplomats. He noted Dar has been appointed as the foreign minister at a time when Pakistan is facing serious challenges on the foreign policy front and the most important issue is maintaining a balance in its relations with the United States (US) and China.

Khan asked former diplomat Maleeha Lodhi what is the most serious challenge for Pakistan on the foreign policy front. Lodhi replied foreign policy begins at home, so the biggest challenge for Pakistan is its economy as foreign policy cannot be very effective unless the economy improves. She said foreign policy challenges include relations with China, Afghanistan, the US and India, but China is the ""strategic priority"" for Pakistan. Noting that Pakistan has entered the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (mega development project), she said it is important to keep it on a positive trajectory.

Lodhi was of the view that it could be a ""declaratory policy"" that Pakistan wants to maintain balance between relations with China and the US, but ""China is its priority, not the US"". She emphasised the country needs to reset its relations with the US but it needs to wait to do so because it is election season there.

Talking about US President Joe Biden's policy towards Pakistan, Lodhi said it seems Biden has a ""blind spot"" for Pakistan as he has never shown any interest in the country throughout his tenure. She noted Donald Trump (former US president) can be re-elected as the president, so Pakistan should be prepared for it.

Commenting on relations with India, Lodhi said if Pakistan wants a working relationship with India, there should be ""reciprocity"" from India as well. She noted it would be a challenge for Pakistan that India has ""completely removed the Kashmir issue from the agenda of bilateral talks"".

Speaking about Dar as the foreign minister, Lodhi said it should be kept in mind that there is continuity in Pakistan's foreign policy and no matter which government comes to power, there is ""no departure"" in the foreign policy. She added Dar brings a lot of experience even though his experience is in finance and he has a lot of ""international exposure"" as well. She mentioned the foreign ministry, as a highly professional institution, would provide support to him. She claimed Dar enjoys the confidence of the top leadership of the party and ""people take such a foreign minister much more seriously"".

Talks with IMF

Khan said Pakistan needs excellent relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the government wants a new ""larger and longer-term"" IMF programme of at least $7bn. He noted an IMF delegation has arrived in Islamabad (Pakistan's capital) and will begin talks regarding the final tranche of $1.1bn under the current agreement. He mentioned it would be the first test of Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb.

Khan spoke with Uzair Younus, an expert on economic affairs, and asked him whether Pakistan's plan to acquire a new extended IMF programme is achievable. Younus replied it is very much achievable and noted the new finance minister had ""clarity in communication"" when he said Pakistan needs to negotiate for a new longer and larger programme.

Younus said a ""blueprint of the contours of the programme"" already exists, so the focus of negotiations should be on its implementation. He commented if the finance minister comes to Washington (US capital) with an implementation plan, it would not be difficult to negotiate a longer programme. He expressed hope that there would be economic stability in the country in the coming months.

APRS000020240312ek3c00a6p, Russia says it killed 234 fighters while thwarting an incursion from Ukraine ,"Ukrainian long-range drones smashed into two oil facilities deep inside Russia on Tuesday, officials said, while an armed incursion claimed by Ukraine-based Russian opponents of the Kremlin unnerved a border region just days before Russia’s presidential election.

The attack by waves of drones across eight regions of Russia displayed Kyiv’s expanding technological capacity as the war extends into its third year. The cross-border ground assault also weakened President Vladimir Putin’s argument that life in Russia has been unaffected by the war, though he remains all but certain to win another six-year term after eliminating all opposition.","The Russian Defense Ministry said that Moscow’s military and security forces killed 234 fighters while thwarting the incursion. In a statement, the ministry blamed the attack on the “Kyiv regime” and “Ukraine’s terrorist formations,” insisting that the Russian military and border forces were able to stop the attackers and avert a cross-border raid. It also said the attackers lost seven tanks and five armored vehicles.

The reports of border fighting earlier on Tuesday were murky, and it was impossible to ascertain with any certainty what was unfolding in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. Cross-border attacks in the area have occurred sporadically since the war began and have been the subject of claims and counterclaims, as well as disinformation and propaganda.

Soldiers who Kyiv officials say are Russian volunteers fighting for Ukraine claimed to have crossed the border. The Freedom of Russia Legion, the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Siberian Battalion released statements and videos on social media claiming to show them on Russian territory. They said they wanted “a Russia liberated from Putin’s dictatorship.”

The authenticity of the videos couldn’t be independently verified.

Fighters coming out of Ukraine attempted to reach the town of Tetkino, which lies close to the border, according to the governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Roman Starovoit. He said Tetkino was being shelled.

“There was an attempt by a sabotage and reconnaissance group to break through. There was a shooting battle, but there was no breakthrough,” he said in a video message on Telegram.

The Russian Defense Ministry said the Tetkino attacks were driven back, but provided no further details.

It also said Ukrainian fighters made at least four attempts to cross into the Belgorod region but all attacks were repelled by warplanes, artillery and missiles.

The representative of Ukraine’s intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, told Ukrainska Pravda that the military groups are made up of Russian citizens.

“On the territory of the Russian Federation, they operate completely autonomously and independently,” he said.

In May, Russia alleged that dozens of Ukrainian militants crossed into one of its border towns in the Belgorod region, striking targets and forcing an evacuation, before more than 70 of the attackers were killed or pushed back by what the authorities termed a counterterrorism operation. Ukrainian officials have denied any link with the group.

Meanwhile, one Ukrainian drone struck and set ablaze an oil refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, according to regional governor Gleb Nikitin. That region is located some about 775 kilometers (480 miles) from the Ukraine border.

In another deep strike, a drone was shot down in the Moscow region, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Though it was brought down well south of the city center, the drone was close to Zhukovsky Airport, one of Mocow’s four international airports.

Another drone hit an oil depot in Oryol, 116 kilometers (95 miles) from Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last year that his country had developed a weapon that hit a target 700 kilometers (400 miles) away, in an apparent reference to drones.

The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian drones were also intercepted Tuesday over the Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, Leningrad and Tula regions of Russia.

Kyiv has staged increasingly bold attacks behind the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line running through eastern and southern Ukraine. It has also increasingly deployed sea drones in the Black Sea, where it claims to have sunk Russian warships.

Kyiv’s forces are hoping for more military supplies from Ukraine’s Western partners, but in the meantime are struggling against a bigger and better-provisioned Russian army that is pressing hard at certain front-line points inside Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said that recent Russian advances have been halted and that the battlefield situation is now significantly better than in the past three months.

“We had some difficulties due to the lack of artillery shells, long-range weapons, sky blocking and the high density of Russian drones,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with France’s BFM TV and Le Monde published late Monday on the Ukrainian presidential website.

Also on Tuesday, an Il-76 heavy-lift transport plane of the Russian air force with 15 people on board crashed while taking off from an air base in the Ivanovo region in western Russia, the Defense Ministry said. Its statement didn't specify whether there were any survivors. The ministry said that an engine fire during takeoff was the likely cause of the crash.

In Ukraine, three people were killed and 44 more were wounded on Tuesday evening as the result of a Russian missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, Ukrainian officials said. Serhii Lysak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region where the city if located, said two residential buildings were damaged.

APRS000020240305ek3500kwt, Ukrainian attacks increasingly sap the power of Russia's Black Sea fleet ,"Ukrainian sea drones reportedly sank another Russian warship in the Black Sea on Tuesday, the latest in a series of strikes that has crippled Moscow’s naval capability and limited its operations with the war now in its third year.

Successful Ukrainian drone and missile strikes have provided a major morale boost for Kyiv at a time when its undermanned and under-gunned forces are facing Russian attacks along the more than 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.","Challenging Russia’s naval superiority also has helped create more favorable conditions for Ukrainian grain exports and other shipments from the country’s Black Sea ports.

Here's a look at recent Ukrainian attacks against Russian naval assets and their consequences.

RELENTLESS STRIKES

In the latest reported strike, Ukrainian naval drones attacked the Sergei Kotov patrol ship near the Kerch Strait, which links the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, according to the Ukraine's military intelligence agency. The strike, which couldn't be independently verified, killed seven members of the Russian crew and injured six others, while 52 were rescued, the agency said.

The Russian Defense Ministry didn’t comment on the claim, but some Russian military bloggers confirmed the ship's loss and said its crew had been rescued.

The strike, if verified, would mark the latest successful use of Ukraine's domestically produced Magura drones, the agile uncrewed boats that have become the Russian navy's nemesis. Just last month, drones sank Russia's Caesar Kunikov amphibious landing ship and Ivanovets missile corvette. The Russian military hasn’t acknowledged those losses, either, but they have been reported by Russian military bloggers and some media.

In another attack in late December, Ukraine said it destroyed the Novocherkassk landing vessel in Crimea’s port of Feodosia with long-range cruise missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry said the ship was damaged in the attack, but Russian war bloggers said it was lost.

The Ukrainian military also has launched a series of persistent cruise missile and drone strikes on Russian radar facilities, air defense assets and air bases in Crimea, a region of Ukraine that Russia annexed in 2014. Increasing the pain for Moscow, Ukrainian troops also downed two Russian early warning and control aircraft over the Sea of Azov in January and February, depriving the Russian military of some of its most precious intelligence-gathering assets.

The strikes followed other highly efficient Ukrainian attacks earlier in the war, including the April 2022 sinking of the Black Sea fleet’s flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, and a missile strike last September on the fleet’s headquarters in the port of Sevastopol.

UKRAINE'S DEADLY WEAPONS

The smart use of remote-controlled drone boats laden with explosives has allowed Ukraine to tip the scales of naval warfare in its favor despite Russia's massive superiority in firepower. The Magura drones are equipped with advanced GPS and cameras, and have a low radar signature that makes them hard to detect.

Its latest version, the Magura V5, is 5.5 meters (18 feet) long, weighs up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) and has a range of up to 800 kilometers (500 miles), 60 hours of battery life, and a 200-kilogram (440-pound) payload, according to Ukrainian authorities. It also beams live video to operators.

Ukraine also has relied on cruise missiles provided by the U.K. and France for striking Russian assets in Crimea. The missiles — produced jointly by Britain and France and called Storm Shadow by the U.K. and SCALP-EG by France — are launched from Ukraine's Soviet-era warplanes and have a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).

Western officials praise the efficiency of the Ukrainian attacks, noting that Kyiv has smartly used its limited resources to defeat far stronger Russian forces and destroy about 20% of the Black Sea fleet, effectively blunting Moscow’s naval dominance.

ENDING THE RUSSIAN BLOCKADE

The successful strikes on Russian naval assets have allowed Ukraine to increase its food and other Black Sea exports despite Russia’s withdrawal last summer from a deal that guaranteed safe shipment of Ukrainian grain.

Moscow’s pullback from the deal raised the possibility of Russian attacks on ships carrying Ukrainian grain and other products, posing a threat to the Ukrainian economy and global food security.

But the steady series of successful Ukrainian attacks on Russian warships and other military assets in the area have put Russia's fleet on the defensive, limiting its offensive capability.

HOW DID RUSSIA REACT?

Although the Russian Defense Ministry has mostly kept quiet about the Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on its naval assets, Russian military bloggers and commentators have harshly criticized the military brass for its slow and sloppy response to the threat.

The strikes have forced the Russian navy to take precautions that have affected its operations, including relocating some of its ships from ports in Crimea farther east to Novorossiysk to better protect them.

Despite the damage from Ukrainian attacks, the Black Sea fleet remains a powerful force and is still capable of launching long-range cruise missile strikes at Ukraine. Russian air bases in Crimea also have remained operational, hosting warplanes that have continued flying combat sorties to support its ground operations in the region.

Russian military bloggers reported that the head of the Black Sea fleet, Adm. Viktor Sokolov, was dismissed last month following the latest losses of warships. There was no official confirmation of his ouster.

Pro-Moscow group calls for rally against anti-Russian protest

The Mother Armenia movement has called for a public gathering in response to a protest planned against the Russian 102nd military base stationed in Gyumri.

The call comes after the pro-Western For the Republic party announced plans to stage a protest outside the base on 23 August to call for the closure of the base and for Armenia's withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).

In June, Yerevan had said that it had no plans to shut down the base and that under the current agreement, the lease runs until 2044.

Mother Armenia said in a statement that the pre-announced anti-Russia protest is being organised by ""pro-Western forces that are pursuing anti-Armenian interests"".

The movement condemned ""provocative actions"" aimed at undermining the presence of the Russian military in Armenia and described the base as a key component of national security.

The statement further warned that ""following the fall of [breakaway] Karabakh, rising tensions in Syunik, and the de facto establishment of the Zangazur corridor [aka Trump Route - a prospective route via southern Armenia], efforts are now being directed at removing the Russian base, a step that would pave the way for Armenia's complete capitulation to Turkey and Azerbaijan"".

The statement also called on the Gyumri mayor and law enforcers to prevent the anti-Russian protest, arguing that it serves the interests of Armenia's adversaries.

Washington deals draw criticism from opposition

Armenia's parliamentary opposition has described the declaration signed by the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders in Washington on 8 August as a ""new existential threat"" and an act of ""capitulation"" for Armenia, Azaturtyun.am, the Armenian service of Radio Liberty, has said.

The Armenia faction said the peace deal with Azerbaijan, initialled in the States, legitimised Azerbaijan's ""ethnic cleansing"" in Karabakh, would erase the issue from the international agenda and lead the way for further Azerbaijani ""aggression"" through an ""unimpeded corridor"" - the so-called Trump Route, aka Zangazur corridor - through Armenia.

""No one can point to what exactly the Armenian interest is in this document - aside from the word 'peace' written on the paper, is there anything truly positive for Armenia?"" said Artsvik Minasyan, secretary of the opposition Armenia faction in an interview with Azatutyun.

Non-parliamentary opposition figure Edmon Marukyan raised concern over the lack of a clearly defined map in the agreement, arguing that this leaves Armenia vulnerable to possible future Azerbaijani territorial claims, the report said.

Political analyst Stepan Danielyan warned that Armenia's agreement to allow Azerbaijani checkpoints in Armenia's southern Syunik Region without any Armenian control undermines Armenia's sovereignty. He also raised concern about the possible involvement of foreign private security forces.

Danielyan linked the timing of the Washington deal to the upcoming USA-Russia summit, suggesting it was used to strengthen the US position during the talks with Russia.

He also pointed to broader geopolitical risks, noting rising influence from the UK, Turkey and Israel in Azerbaijan, and warned the deal could further entrench great power competition in the region.

Former Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian (Vardan Oskanyan) harshly criticised the ""government's concessions"" over the so-called Zangazur corridor, accusing the authorities of presenting a ""strategic defeat"" as a ""strategic victory"".

Oskanian said that handing over a strip of land stretching from east to west under conditions allowing unimpeded Azerbaijani access for 99 years without customs checks, border control or the right to inspect what passes through constitutes a loss of national sovereignty.

""No political manoeuvre can change this reality. You are leasing part of your sovereignty for at least two generations. This is not diplomacy; it is the sale of national dignity,"" he said, describing the proposed route as a ""corridor of dependence and humiliation"".

The website of the pro-opposition Hraparak daily says that following the Washington declaration a harsh Russian reaction was expected, with many predicting that Moscow would not forgive Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan for ""ditching"" it and abandoning the Russian-mediated 9 November 2020 deal. The daily, however, says that sources close to the Russian authorities say Moscow is largely indifferent to developments in and around Armenia.

According to the daily, various Russian government circles have conveyed to Armenian counterparts that no steps will be taken if the Armenian public considers the latest developments acceptable. The daily says that even Iran has sought clarity on Russia's stance to coordinate its own actions but received the same response.

Sources cited by the daily say the main reason for this attitude is that Russia is waiting to see what kind of resolution there will be on the Ukrainian front. Moscow believes that the Washington agreement has so many pitfalls that its implementation is simply unrealistic. But through internal channels, they have also made it clear to the Armenian authorities that regarding the unblocking of regional roads, they are in favour of implementing the trilateral agreements negotiated with their participation.

The daily concludes that Moscow has decided to closely observe how far Armenia's leadership will go, questioning how a government that spent four years negotiating with Russia and had a 30-year partnership could suddenly pivot to the USA. The daily says that once they understand it, they will plan their actions accordingly.

Separately, Hraparak says, citing its sources, that before signing the Washington deals, Azerbaijan not only engaged in prolonged preparatory work but also launched psychological pressure campaigns targeting Armenia's leadership, exploiting their known vulnerabilities.

Sources say that over the past month, Azerbaijani military aircraft conducted repeated reconnaissance flights along Armenia's borders, displaying ""aggressive"" behaviour. The Armenian government reportedly failed to grasp the real motive behind this increased activity, especially given that the Washington meetings and the intialling of the peace deal had already been agreed upon.

The daily also reports that Armenia's Foreign Intelligence Service provided a briefing to the government, warning that Azerbaijan was discussing multiple scenarios, and if ""the negotiations regarding the Zangazur corridor fail, Azerbaijan, with the support of Turkey, is ready to use force to seize key parts of Syunik Region"". This, the daily says, effectively put an end to all hesitation, and Pashinyan hastily went and signed everything, exclusively in the context of Azerbaijani demands. While some believe this information was deliberately leaked by Azerbaijan as part of its ""cunning"" politics, the daily notes that fear ultimately silenced rational voices within the Armenian leadership.

Separately, Hraparak's website says that the published text of the peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan initialled in Washington contains no provisions favourable to Armenia.

The daily says that the document makes no mention of the rights of Karabakh Armenians, the release of Armenians held by Baku, the withdrawal of Azerbaijani troops from ""occupied"" Armenian territories, or any specific map for border delimitation. Instead, it includes clauses that are not only not aimed at establishing peace, but will also provoke internal unrest, plunge Armenia into a new period of turbulence, create new and unsolvable problems, and lay the groundwork for new concessions.

The daily highlights Clauses 8 and 9 of the treaty as particularly problematic. Clause 8 states that the parties condemn and will combat intolerance, racial hatred, separatism, and terrorism. The daily questions why such language is included, given that both countries are already party to relevant international conventions.

The answer, the daily says, lies in Clause 9, which obliges both sides to address cases of missing persons and enforced disappearances from the conflict through information exchange, noting that relevant arrangements will be negotiated and thoroughly agreed upon in a separate agreement. Thus, according to Clause 9, a separate agreement addressing all the above-mentioned issues still needs to be concluded, the contents of which and the pitfalls it may contain for Armenia are unknown.

The daily warns that this clause could enable Azerbaijan to demand criminal investigations into participants in the First Karabakh War, targeting Armenian military figures and war veterans under the pretext of implementing justice. And if Armenia rejects such demands, it could be accused of supporting separatism, undermining Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, or obstructing justice.

Furthermore, the daily warns that Baku will demand to punish all the ""revanchists"", those accusing Azerbaijan of vandalism and genocide, those fighting against the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Karabakh, and so on. All of this, the daily says, would be coordinated through a follow-up agreement, uniquely required only for these specific clauses out of the treaty's 17 clauses, suggesting their strategic importance to both Baku and, potentially, the current Armenian leadership.

Finally, the daily argues, this follow-up agreement may be used not only to suppress domestic opposition to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, but also to silence those opposing Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Azerbaijani ""aggression"".

Minister praises Baku-Yerevan declaration

Meanwhile, Armenian Economy Minister Gevorg Papoyan highlighted the economic significance of the Washington declaration. He noted that during the Iran-Israel war, the South Caucasus served as the only safe air route, prompting global recognition of the need for a secure land route as well. He said the new corridor will turn Armenia into a key cargo hub between China and Europe, enhancing its security importance as any disruption during future conflicts would draw greater international attention. He added that cargo transit through Armenia will generate customs revenue, infrastructure development and economic benefits. Additionally, the opening of new routes will reduce transportation costs for Armenian exports and with the reopening of the Turkish border, Armenia can access Mediterranean ports, which could further lower import and export costs.

According to Papoyan, the agreement will lead to significant economic investments and boost exports, imports and overall foreign investment in Armenia. Papoyan stated that as a transport hub, Armenia will play a key role in global trade and enhance its strategic importance and security. He said that if US companies build a railway along the potential Trump Route for Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP; aka Zangazur corridor, via southern Armenia), it would not harm Armenia but would bring major benefits and operate under Armenian law, just like the Russian Railways currently does. He said Armenia should find a formula to live peacefully with its neighbours and the agreement signed in Washington is that formula. Those who oppose it, he argued, prefer Armenia to remain a tool in the hands of other powers and reject peace. Papoyan added that the new route would also be economically beneficial for Iran, as it would allow direct access from Armenia's Meghri to Azerbaijan's Naxcivan railway, then through Armenia's Yeraskh into Armenia, enabling faster cargo transport. He noted that both Iran's president and foreign minister have confirmed they see no security risks in this arrangement.

Papoyan also noted that there are no issues with Russia regarding this matter, as Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), maintains close partnership with Russia and is a strategic ally. He emphasised that all relevant matters are resolved within this relationship.

Exiled separatist Karabakh MPs say Baku-Yerevan peace deal omits key issues

Parliamentary factions of Azerbaijan's defunct breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region have issued a statement in response to the 8 August trilateral meeting of the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and the United States in Washington.

While acknowledging past international peace efforts, the parliamentary factions criticised the dissolution of the OSCE Minsk Group and accused its co-chairs of abandoning their mediation role. They said that the lack of condemnation of the 2020 Karabakh war, which they said was started by Baku, led to further escalation and the exodus of Karabakh Armenians in 2023, and that the Minsk Group ignored the International Court of Justice resolution on the right of Karabakh Armenians to return to their homes.

The statement warned that any Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal excluding key issues, such as the safe return of Karabakh Armenians, protection of cultural heritage, and the release of Armenian detainees held by Baku would fail to deliver a lasting peace. The statement called for a process based on justice, rights and mutual trust.

Armenia, Georgia discuss regional peace prospects

Commenting on the outcomes of the 8 August meetings in Washington, Mirzoyan emphasised that the agreements reached create new opportunities for regional cooperation and peace. The sides also discussed their bilateral partnership agenda.

- While Russian pro-war bloggers confirmed that the Sergey Kotov warship has been 'destroyed', the Defence Ministry in Moscow and Russian state media have so far kept silent about the incident

Full story

Russia's Black Sea Fleet Sergey Kotov large patrol ship has reportedly been sunk by Ukrainian sea drones off occupied Crimea, Ukrainian military intelligence reported on its Telegram channel on 5 March.

According to the report, the Sergey Kotov was attacked on the night of 4-5 March by Ukraine's military intelligence Group 13 unit.

""As a result of a strike by Magura V5 maritime drones, the Russian ship Project 22160 Sergey Kotov sustained damage to the stern, starboard and port sides,"" it said, noting that the incident happened ""near the Kerch Strait"".

The ship was worth about $65 million, the report added.

In a later post,Ukrainian military intelligence shared its own video footage purporting to show the destruction of the Sergey Kotov.

Russian pro-war bloggers acknowledge incident

Russian pro-war bloggers aren't disputing the attack on the warship, with some saying the crew are alive.

Voenny Osvedomitel (Military Informant) blogger was among the first to share a 15-second video footage purporting to show a massive blast on the ship following cross-fire shooting.

Dva Mayora Telegram channel reshared the same video, saying that the Russian servicemen on board had ""bravely fought"" with the attackers.

According to Kots, the penultimate such attack against the vessel occurred in September 2023, when it repelled five Ukrainian unmanned drones.

""The crew fought heroically to the end. This can be seen from the published video. But this time it is a story without a happy ending,"" Kots wrote.

On 14 September 2023, the Russian Defence Ministry reported that the ship had repelled an attack by five Ukrainian sea drones.

The Defence Ministry in Moscow has not yet commented on the latest incident with the Sergey Kotov ship. And no mention of it has also been observed on Russian state TV, according to media monitoring tool Medialogiya.

According to information in Russian open sources, th Sergey Kotov patrol ship was entered into service at the beginning of 2021. The ship officially joined the Black See Fleet in July 2022. Russia's state-controlled Channel One thendescribed the ship as the ""most modern patrol ship"" with its special design and coating making it ""virtually invisible to enemy radars"".

Russia's Black Sea Fleet has four such patrol ships manufactured within the same project. The lead ship Vasily Bykov was commissioned in 2018, and the other two production ships - Dmitry Rogachev and Pavel Derzhavin - entered service in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

This is the latest incident involving a Russian Black Sea Fleet ship after it was reported that Ukraine destroyed the Tzezar Kunikov large landing ship off Russian-occupied Crimea mid-February 2024.

APRS000020240313ek3d00htp, Kenya's president reaffirms commitment to deploy a police force to Haiti to help quell gang violence ,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday the country will still lead a U.N.-backed multi-national police force to help quell gang violence in Haiti once a transitional presidential council is formed in the Caribbean country.

Ruto said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had briefed him on the latest developments in Haiti and that he assured Blinken of Kenya’s commitment to deploy a police force to Haiti.","“I assured Secretary Blinken that Kenya will take leadership of the U.N. Security Support Mission in Haiti to restore peace and security,"" Ruto said.

Kenya's Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing'oei on Tuesday said Kenya had put on hold the deployment of 1,000 of its policemen until a clear administration is in place in Haiti. The announcement came after Haiti Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he would resign once a presidential council is created.

Kenya had agreed last October to lead a U.N.-authorized international police force to Haiti, but the country’s top court in January ruled it unconstitutional, in part because of a lack of reciprocal agreements on such deployments between the two countries.

Ruto said that he and Henry had witnessed the signing of the reciprocal agreements between Kenya and Haiti on March 1, clearing the path for the deployment.

Under the plan, the U.N.-backed multi-national police led by Kenyan officers was to help quell gang violence that has long plagued Haiti. But violence escalated sharply since Feb. 29, with gunmen burning police stations, closing the main international airports and raiding the country’s two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates.

Scores have been killed, and more than 15,000 are homeless after fleeing neighborhoods raided by gangs. Food and water are dwindling and the main port in the capital of Port-au-Prince remains closed, stranding dozens of containers with critical supplies.

After returning from a trip to Kenya where he had gone to salvage plans for the African country’s deployment, Henry has been locked out of his own country and has remained in Puerto Rico since last week.

Ahead of March 8, the President visited the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School, named after Hero of the Soviet Union Anatoly Serov, and met with its graduates.","Ahead of the meeting, Vladimir Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Southern Federal District Vladimir Ustinov and Krasnodar Territory Governor Veniamin Kondratyev inspected the personnel training facility. While in one of the classrooms, the President was shown aircraft simulators in action. School Head Anatoly Yudin provided explanations.

Established in 1938, the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School now trains crews for operational-tactical, long-range, military-transport and naval aviation units. Since September 2017, the education institution has been training female students.

* * *

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: To be honest, our meeting is taking place in an unusual format. We are meeting with young female pilots in the run-up to March 8.

I would like to congratulate all of you on the upcoming holiday. This is a good and very positive spring holiday. I wish you every success in your careers, a happy family life and marital bliss. I am confident that you will accomplish everything because you are strong-willed people. You are acting purposefully and steering towards your goals.

Mr Shoigu told me how the first cadets enrolled here. I do not know whether this young woman is present here or not. A prospective cadet who failed to enrol pitched up a tent in front of the gate. Indeed, this attitude towards life and her future career is worth a lot. I am confident that, given such an attitude, you will accomplish everything. This is the first thing.

Second, female professionals achieve results in many fields. This is hardly surprising because, apart from their impressive training levels, women meticulously analyse the smallest details linked with their career. Young women display a highly responsible attitude towards the work with which they have been entrusted. On the whole, this allows them to achieve good results.

I am confident that you will also attain results, all the more so as you have graduated from a school that is closely linked with Russia and our Armed Forces. Suffice it to recall the Great Patriotic War. Your school's graduates served as prototypes for many books, artistic works, films and even an opera. Many graduates became Heroes of the Soviet Union, Heroes of Russia and heroes of other countries where our pilots were actively involved in hostilities.

They destroyed literally thousands of enemy tanks, as well as aircraft and artillery crews. Your school's graduates rammed enemy planes on 20 occasions during the Great Patriotic War. This is a heroic educational institution. I am confident that you will also continue the wonderful traditions of this pilot training school.

Of course, the uninitiated tend to link aviation with romantic blue skies. However, you have probably felt that there is something more to it, apart from the romance. Well, of course, it is impossible to do without the omnipresent romance here. And now ... Is your name Katya? Am I right?

Yekaterina Battalova: Guards Lieutenant Battalova.

Vladimir Putin: She was now operating the controls, and we could hear that she was quite composed. She is made for this job. She is enjoying her work, and she is quite enthusiastic about her future lifetime career, to which all of you have decided to devote your lives.

What am I trying to say? Quite possibly, elements of a romantic blue sky are present here. However, this career requires high standards of professional training and a serious attitude towards work. This is a complicated sphere: one should have a good knowledge of equipment and be able to operate it. This amounts to large-scale and responsible work. I want to wish you all the best.

Our women and quite young girls currently serve in the special military operation zone. They worthily serve the Motherland in various fields everywhere.

Once again, I congratulate you on the upcoming holiday, and I wish you all the best.

I am at your service, if there is anything that you would like to discuss, please do.

Violetta Kasilovich: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief.

Before I ask my question, let me take this opportunity to thank you and the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defence for giving us, ordinary girls, the opportunity to become military pilots of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

The year 2023 was particularly important for us. The most memorable event for us is graduation from the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School. What was the most memorable event in 2023 for you?

Vladimir Putin: You know, my life consists of an endless number of events and activities. Sometimes I compare it to a waterfall: standing under a waterfall, it pours constantly.

Even when I am with my loved ones, I try not to show any signs of stress, and, on the contrary, I pretend that everything is fine, we are quite at ease and having a rest. But I know that in five minutes I will get a phone call from someone, in ten minutes I will have to call someone else, and within 30 minutes there will be some event and I'll have to understand what happened and, if necessary, react to it somehow or adjust something. So, it's just a series of events.

But, of course, like for the country as a whole, for me and for you, I think, all the brightest, most significant things happened on the battlefield - in the zone of the special military operation. Then, of course, there are a lot of issues related to the economy, to maintaining it, its development, to ensuring a rate of economic growth. This is the foundation that everything is built on, our whole life - both our social life and our military successes are based on benchmarks in the economy, in the real sector of industry. So, everything is basically there.

The most vivid events are, of course, meetings with our men, or with our women, our girls who serve in the special military operation, or with members of their families. Frankly, I try not to show emotion, but still, these events, these meetings have the brightest emotional colouring. So everything is connected with these events, just like for you, just like for the overwhelming majority of our citizens.

Yelizaveta Fedotova: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, may I ask you a question? Lieutenant Fedotova.

You have flown and even personally piloted many types of aircraft, and recently you flew on a Tu-160M &Atilde;&cent;??&Atilde;&cent;??strategic missile carrier. Please tell us about this experience. Do you have any plans to master other modern planes?

Vladimir Putin: Just now I flew a simulator with the comrade lieutenant - this is also a definite experience. But as for piloting... You know, I really piloted a glider, flew with cranes - if you remember, it was several years ago. But that was not a simulator, I actually piloted it, it's true.

But I also had to train then, because the sky is a serious business. Who else but you knows this? We flew low, I also flew low - about 400 metres. As soon as the wind blows, it shakes. These are not simulators, 400 metres is a bit high. That is when I piloted.

And other planes I flew on were a Su-25 attack plane, then a Su-27 fighter, a Tu-160, and a Be-200 when we were putting out fires. Of course, I did not pilot anything. However, it was all useful and interesting, and I needed to understand what it was all about. You always need to understand what a thing is, touch it with your hands, then you will better understand what is happening.

I do not mean to offend anyone, but I think that the hardest type of service is piloting an attack plane. G force! I just cannot understand how these guys control the plane, because up and down, strikes are carried out visually, when they see the target, they descend sharply, and then rise just as sharply. The G force is so great that only the hands and fingers move effectively. I cannot understand how they fly the plane.

The only so-called piloting element was on the Su-27, when the commander suggested that I perform a ""roll."" I did this myself. He said: ""I am delegating you the controls. Be smooth, no sudden movements, move the controls to the right, and we will do a roll."" I did it myself, it's true. We rolled easily, the plane is very powerful. But he said just that: ""The plane is powerful, very responsive, manoeuvrable, take your time with it."" So I did it myself.

In 2005, we experienced a remarkable five-hour flight on the Tu-160, which was an absolute delight. The trip was a unique experience, particularly during the imperceptible transition to supersonic speed. The click associated with this shift is inaudible on the plane but audible on the ground.

The last flight [on the Tu-160M] was not originally planned because the Minister [of Defence Sergei Shoigu] said that we cannot fly because the machine had not yet been officially accepted, a sentiment echoed by the industry. However, during our visit to the enterprise [Gorbunov Kazan Aircraft Production Association] and a tour around it, the aircraft's commander assured me, ""Mr President, we are ready. We can be in the air in two hours. I suggest you give it a try."" I agreed, proposing to schedule it for the next day due to prior commitments. The commander responded, ""We will be ready."" And so, we boarded and took to the skies.

It was interesting to see the transformation the aircraft has undergone since my last flight in 2005. The changes were extensive: it is practically a new machine. The crew told me about the numerous updates, emphasising that nearly everything, including the avionics, had been revamped. The commander encouraged me to turn on the engines, press some buttons, and so on. It was very enlightening to get some hands-on experience.

This modernisation was carried out at the initiative of the Minister of Defence. While various proposals were considered, with some suggesting closing this chapter and opening an entirely new one, it became evident that such a shift would likely result in a gap in our access to combat-ready strategic aviation.

I think we made the right decision, and the Minister had a good suggestion. We actually created a new aircraft that is unparalleled globally: a supersonic machine operating at unprecedented speeds. This strategic aircraft is equipped to carry nuclear weapons, thereby fortifying our nuclear triad.

One more thing: I attempted to operate a simulator myself. When the lieutenant suggested I take control, I declined, saying that she would do much better. Instead, I decided to try my hand at piloting a helicopter. I found it to be the most challenging type of flying. Just a millimeter of difference in the control can send it veering in different directions, making it tricky to pinpoint the exact landing spot. I think helicopters are the most difficult to pilot.

Except, of course, what I really piloted when flying with the cranes. But this was a real situation. This is a simulator, but it's a complicated job. This is a very complicated job where every millimeter matters. This is why army aviation, which is performing very serious missions today that we badly need on the battlefield, naturally deserves the highest praise and respect. That probably takes care of my entire aviation history.

But having felt all this and flown various aircraft, I might say that it seems like a man's job, although it is certainly accessible to girls and women. In general, I believe there are no jobs that women shouldn't do and can't achieve success with. Young women work and achieve success everywhere in our country. True, there have been no women yet in maritime aviation, torpedo or missile aviation. After all, these jobs are particularly risky, and I think we should protect young women.

Go ahead, please.

Yana Vasina: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, permission to speak please. I am Lieutenant Vasina.

Russia has been and remains a great aviation power. Starting from the time of Captain Nesterov and Valery Chkalov and up to this day, military pilots have been glorifying our Motherland through their courage and bravery. However, they take their first steps to the skies within the walls of a flight school. As a pilot, I would like to know what you think about pilot training and the future of aviation training.

Vladimir Putin: It is difficult for me to give my advice. But there is one thing I know for sure, and we discussed this with the Defence Ministry officials - we need modern, effective simulators. And, of course, we need instructors that can do this job.

As I understand it, we do not have problems with simulator availability today, but if we have a problem, we'll resolve it. At any rate, we have everything we need for high quality simulators to be available. I believe we have even surpassed our competitors with some simulators - ours are very effective.

And what do you do now, after graduation?

Yana Vasina: I serve on Tu-154 in Khabarovsk in the Far East.

Vladimir Putin: When you trained as a pilot, what did you think should have been added to your training?

Yana Vasina: Certainly, a simulator. This is an essential part of flight training now. It is possible to master flying without it, but it makes the process much easier.

Vladimir Putin: Did you learn to fly without a simulator?

Yana Vasina: I haven't yet flown a Tu-154 simulator.

Vladimir Putin: You mean specifically a Tu-154 simulator. I see. In this case, Mr Shoigu, we need to have simulators for all aircraft models for young women and men to learn on in the future.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, the Tu-154 has been out of production for many years.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, I see. I am also referring to other aircraft.

Sergei Shoigu: You are correct about other aircraft. We must provide simulators for Tu-214s. We have aircraft of this class. Under your instructions, we are beginning to manufacture the Tu-96 again, and we need simulators for those as well. So our plan will be as follows - every consignment of aircraft, especially training planes, will include simulators in the contract.

Vladimir Putin: Let us do it without fail, it must be included in the state defence order. This is very important. Comrade Lieutenant asked me how I flew and what I flew. You know, it's important, it really matters. Because on one type of aircraft the pedals move in one way, and on other types of aircraft - in a different way, and this little thing can make a difference when piloting. It does make a difference.

Unfortunately, we have also had mistakes that have led to tragedies, when crews transfer from one type of similar aircraft to another similar aircraft, with systems that operate somewhat differently.

Sergei Shoigu: You mean the Yak-40, Yak-42?

Vladimir Putin: Yes. That is why it is the right thing to do. We will definitely pay attention to it. You are right.

Yana Vasina: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, please.

Darya Ignasheva: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief.

You have a very intense working schedule, including constant long flights. Tell me, please, what was your longest flight and how do you manage to keep yourself in such excellent physical shape with such a busy schedule?

Vladimir Putin: As for physical fitness, I'll tell you now.

There were a lot of long, long flights, I don't remember now, but we probably flew to Latin America somewhere, to Mexico - such flights across the ocean. Although, you know, sometimes you can fly from one point in Russia to another faster than across the ocean. It's a big country, the sun never sets on it.

I have to spend a lot of time on the plane. There was a moment, I can't remember exactly when, when I had the impression that I was living on a plane. Yes, yes.

And as for staying in shape, I always answer the same, and there is no magic trick. I always say: sport, you should play sports. And I kind of recommend everyone else do it - I recommend everyone plays sports, that's it.

More to the point, we - if you have been paying attention, we talked about this recently - we will even offer tax deductions for people who regularly participate in sports and meet the Fit for Labour and Defence standards. We will treat them accordingly and help people who take care of their own health.

This is why sport is really an important way to stay fit. But it goes without saying that I almost never drink alcohol. In fact, I try not to talk about it, although, probably, it should be talked about. But I definitely try not to drink strong drinks.

Cold exposure training is a very good procedure: this is important for you as officers. It is true. Hot and cold showers or contrast baths are an effective way to strengthen your health. I remember, you know, when I was still young and lived in Leningrad, we had... we did not even have a bath tub in our communal apartment, but nevertheless I went out into the yard in the winter and wiped myself with snow. I was still a kid.

Why am I telling you this? Because you can always find a way to achieve the result you need if you want it. Taking care of your health is important, not only personally, but for the state, so I wish for you to stay healthy, beautiful, and successful.

Yes, please.

Yulia Zakalyukina: Lieutenant Zakalyukina.

How would you feel if the captain of Air Force One was a woman?

Vladimir Putin: First, I will tell you, I do not select the crews of the aircraft I fly on: this is done by the management of certain aviation services. But they are all distinguished and very experienced people who are dedicated to their work and highly professional; I have no doubts about this. I saw it for myself several times.

In fact, I believe we should still be guided not by gender, but by business principles when promoting anyone, not only in the military, but in general, in business, anywhere. If a person is competent and has good results in their work, then in no case should they be restricted by gender, like, ""well, a woman does not need to be promoted; she has a family and children, and should have her own life."" This is wrong.

On the other hand, I believe it's misguided when it is required to have a certain percentage of women in certain areas: this percent in management, that in parliament, this in local administration, and that one in the Army. People should not be judged in terms of percentages, but by personal and business qualities, by attitude.

So, if there is a choice, and a woman is successful in an assignment in any place, position, or when moving up the career ladder, of course, there should be no restrictions.

Kristina Zhdanova: Permission to speak, Sir?

Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, please.

Kristina Zhdanova: Lieutenant Zhdanova.

What would you wish, on the eve of International Women's Day, for the women that are performing their duties and missions in the special military operation?

Vladimir Putin: To return home as soon as possible. I wish them happiness, personal happiness and successes - both combat success and success in their personal lives. I am completely sincere in saying this.

I said I hope for them to return home as soon as possible. But I also know something different about military versus civilians. I will talk about journalists, war correspondents. I saw how they work on the frontline, including young women, performing their journalistic duty. I instructed the top managers of the main channels to withdraw women from the battle field. Why expose women to that risk?

What was the result? They took a vacation and stayed there on their own. And, the TV channel managers told me these women were ready to quit their jobs and would go there anyway. The same is true for many other women on combat missions there. I know this - I talked to them. They consider it their duty to be there. They are serving the Motherland; this is their mission, their inner life impulse.

Incidentally, this has been the case in many other periods of our history, including the events in Afghanistan. I know personal examples, women who believed they should be there, and that was that. Nevertheless, I want them to return home to their families and their responsibilities in this area as soon as possible.

However, I am certainly most grateful to them for what they are doing, for their attitude towards their service, their work, their service to the Fatherland and I wish them happiness.

Maria Kuzina: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief!

I am Lieutenant Kuzina.

We seriously realise the complexity of the military-political situation and today's historical period. Like over 80 years ago, Nazism has raised its head today and is trying to rule the world. Allow me to express support and deep gratitude to you on behalf of the graduates and all military personnel of the Armed Forces.

Mr President! You may rely on the Officer Corps of the Russian Federation. We will not let you down.

Vladimir Putin: I have no doubt about this. The Russian Officer Corps has always - I want to emphasise the word ""always"" - at all historical turns and all historical stages has demonstrated its highest loyalty to the Motherland, the Fatherland and their duty. Due to these qualities in our officers, Russia has always achieved results and has always emerged victorious from the most difficult trials.

But when the military is telling me ""We will not let you down,"" I hear ""We will not let our Motherland down."" As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I would like to reply to you by saying ""Thank you for your service.""

Do you have any other questions? Are all of you content with the jobs you received upon graduating from flight school? Do you have any other needs or questions? Or would you like to tell me something without the minister and other chiefs in attendance? No? Is everything okay with you?

Remark: Yes, everything is okay.

Vladimir Putin: Then, I would like to wish you every success. Happy holiday, happy March 8!

I wish you all the best. Have a good day!

The Russian Defence Ministry claimed on 21 March that its forces had advanced in Ukraine's Donetsk Region, which Russia refers to as the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).","According to the statement, ""coordinated actions of the Tsentr [Centre] group of troops have liberated the settlement of Tonenke"" west of Avdiivka. Also, ""units of the Southern group of troops have seized the Alebastrova railway station"" between Klishchiyivka and Andriyivka south of Bakhmut, the ministry said.

State news agency TASS quoted ""DPR head advisor"" Igor Klimakovksy as saying that the village of Tonenke was the base of the Vampire MRLS, with which ""Ukrainian armed formations"" had stricken ""the centre of Donetsk in 2022 and 2023"" claiming dozens of civilian lives.

The news came just two days after the Defence Ministry had claimed the capture of the village Orlivka near Avdiivka.

BBCSUP0020240308ek380012x,"Report says 2,000 men on Ukraine's Russian PoW list","By BBC Monitoring

A Ukrainian government project has published a list of some 2,000 names of people it describes as Russian prisoners of war, Russian investigative website Vazhnyye Istorii (Important Stories or IStories) reports.","IStories said it analysed the Khochu Zhit (I want to live) list and found on it 64 dead persons and ""at least"" 66 individuals regarded as missing. It also found 15 duplicate entries.

IStories said it had contacted family members of some of the people on the list.

In one case, a Russian serviceman's sister had already learned from the Russian Defence Ministry of her brother having been taken prisoner. However, in another case, the Russian serviceman's relative in question did not know he was a prisoner of war.

IStories said there were no accurate numbers of Russian prisoners of war. It said the most recent statement from Russian officials had come from Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic in occupied Ukraine who in October 2023 put the number of Russians troops held by Ukraine at 500.

IStories cited an official saying that 543 Russian service personnel had been brought back to Russia in 2024 in three separate swaps. According to IStories, a majority of those included in the 3 January 2024 swap were former convicts. It speculated at the time that the reasoning behind that may have been that it should be easier to make a convicted person go back to war.

IStories said Russia had secured the release of a total of 2,000 service personnel since the start of the war, but it could not give the exact figure because in some cases the Russian authorities withheld numbers.

It also said it was aware of cases of Chechen units ""buying out"" Ukrainian prisoners of war to subsequently swap them for Chechen troops. There have also been unofficial swaps on the front line.

Khochu Zhit is a Ukrainian government project set up to encourage Russian servicemen to surrender. It promises humane treatment in line with the international conventions and opportunities to seek asylum in Ukraine or outside it or return to Russia in a prisoner swap.

BBCSUP0020240318ek3i000xd,"Russian weekly TV highlights: Putin, 'Nazi' Ukraine, nuclear again, more Macron","Main themes on Russian TV weekly news review programmes on Rossiya 1, Channel One and NTV on 17 March

&#8216;Reformatting of world order&#8217;&#160;","On an election-themed night on Russia&#8217;s three main TV channels on 17 March, host Irada Zeynalova of NTV&#8217;s Itogi Nedeli (Results of the Week) spoke of &#8220;links in the same chain&#8221; (both &#8220;our elections&#8221;, &#8220;regarded in the West as a vote in support of the course that has been taken&#8221;, and those to come in the US and the EU). This, she said, is about &#8220;reformatting the world order&#8221;. Everything is viewed &#8220;through the same prism of the Ukrainian conflict by everyone&#8221;.

&#8220;That is to say, the entire system of global relations is now being tested. Everyone understands that in the end the world will definitely become different, a new alliance will be formed, new rules, a new order will begin to work. And that the international institutions that were created after World War II no longer work, or the treaties that everyone voluntarily promised to observe, precisely because they no longer solve the problems that emerge, and their opinion is appealed to only when it is convenient for politicians,&#8221; as per Zeynalova&#8217;s seemingly abstract commentary at the top of the news.

In the meantime, it was tonight&#8217;s news reviews that were reformatted as Vladimir Putin claimed his fifth term as Russia&#8217;s president. On NTV, Itogi Nedeli made an earlier start than usual, at 1850 Moscow time (1550 gmt), against its usual start time of 1900 (all Moscow time henceforth). Rossiya 1 brought forward its Vesti Nedeli (News of the Week), with Dmitry Kiselyov, by an hour, to start at 1900 rather than its usual 2000. At an hour and 55 minutes, the programme was shorter than usual, to make way for a version of election coverage in the form of an unscheduled Vesti bulletin for the next two hours.

Channel One&#8217;s &#8220;special&#8221; Vremya (Time) edition started at its usual time of 2100 but it extended its bulletin late into the night to include the latest speeches by Vladimir Putin, which took the programme into four-hour territory. Its veteran host Yekaterina Andreyeva was at the helm, not always smoothly, throughout the programme.

Early, pre-exit poll coverage

NTV&#8217;s Itogi Nedeli and Rossiya 1&#8217;s Vesti Nedeli were aired well before exit poll data was officially announced at 2100, which gave Putin a landslide share of 87% of the vote. Accordingly, their reports were confined to heavy hints from voters about the kind of candidate they would like to lead Russia in the next six years. &#8220;We need someone who will lead our country for the next six years. Someone who is decisive, who is courageous and who will bring us to victory,&#8221; a man captioned as ex-navy told NTV.&#160;

The discourse claimed a high turnout and emphasised the importance of the vote as a manifestation of unity and consolidation in the face of external pressure and hostility. This was Dmitry Kiselyov of Vesti Nedeli, for example: &#8220;We need to understand the nature of such high civic activity. This, now, is a special election. In effect, it is a wartime one, as both missile salvoes and drone swarms head in our direction every day in the hope that they can disrupt the electoral process through intimidation. However, exactly the opposite has happened. People rallied and even those who had not done so before went to vote. Such a high turnout is the answer to all attempts to interfere with the election.&#8221;

The vox pop in the reports was monotone, not to say apparently scripted, as voters, to camera, expressed their sentiment in near-identical terms. Some recalled the hardship of the 1990s and by contrast invoked what they described as the many changes for the better in their lives now. Others professed their pride in Russia, apparently the envy of the world. Separately, voters in Russia&#8217;s &#8220;new regions&#8221; (such as Donbas and other occupied Ukraine) were given the floor to say they were happy to be back with Russia again.

Separate reports were fashioned to describe the vote in Russia&#8217;s border Belgorod Region, where voters were unafraid to be active even though it has been under continuous attack from Ukraine, as the story ran.

&#8220;The fact is that Russia has a very transparent and democratic electoral system, as international public observers note,&#8221; according to Rossiya 1&#8217;s summary of the state of affairs.&#160;

Ukraine&#8217;s &#8216;terrorist tactics&#8217;

In the context of Belgorod and more generally, Ukraine was described as either a terrorist or Nazi &#8220;regime&#8221;, or both. On Rossiya 1&#8217;s Vesti Nedeli, Kiselyov used the slur &#8220;Bandera Nazi regime&#8221; repeatedly and pointedly throughout his programme. A start on this usage was made as Kiselyov looked back to his interview with Putin at the start of last week, to which he returned again and again during his programme. &#8220;It is important to realise the historical inevitability of the battle with the Bandera Nazi regime, which, with the support of the West, has encroached not only on its own Russians [in Ukraine], but also on Russia itself. And the Russians are today the largest divided nation in the world,&#8221; Kiselyov said. &#8220;If we abandon these people today, then tomorrow our losses may increase many times over, and our children will not have a future, because we will feel insecure. We will be a third or fourth class nation. No one will take us into account if we cannot protect ourselves. And the consequences could be catastrophic for Russian statehood,&#8221; Putin told Kiselyov. &#8220;The West also understands that for Russia this is a matter of life and death. They dream about the death of Russia. Hence all these insane quantities of weapons and money provided to the Bandera Nazi regime. They have even begun to discuss sending troops. Maybe we should also take an unconventional step and ask to send North Korean troops to help us? After all, the friendly DPRK has an army of more than two million, and we once helped North Korea a lot in the battle with America. Putin&#8217;s response was that on the one hand, he did not obviously rule out such a turn, but at the same time, there is no need to turn to North Korea now. We can handle it ourselves,&#8221; Kiselyov said. &#8220;But a categorical no was the response to the question whether it ever occurred to us, during difficult moments for the front last year, to use tactical nuclear weapons,&#8221; Kiselyov added.

As elsewhere, Channel One described what it framed as &#8220;attempted breakthroughs&#8221;, that is to say incursions into Russia from Ukraine by hostile forces, as an attempt to destabilise Russia during the presidential election. &#8220;Carried out by elite Ukrainian special forces along with foreign mercenaries, with armour and artillery support&#8221;, they were repelled. &#8220;As a result, hundreds of militants are dead, dozens of pieces of equipment destroyed, but the Russian border is still securely locked,&#8221; according to Channel One&#8217;s Yekaterina Andreyeva&#8217;s summary. &#8220;After this rout, the adversary switched to its usual terrorist tactics as it launched strikes against peaceful neighbourhoods, including with drones stuffed full of explosives,&#8221; it added.

Channel One went on to liken Ukraine to Nazi Germany, branding Kyiv &#8220;a Nazi regime&#8221; and &#8220;direct successor to Hitler's&#8221;, complete with a campaign of &#8220;mass terror&#8221;.

Over on NTV, the Belgorod raid was framed as an attempt at distraction amid bad news from the battlefield. &#8220;Militants have been trying to get into the Kursk region and Belgorod region like cockroaches since Tuesday. Ever since then, action has been taken to crush them like bedbugs,&#8221; the report remarked.

Escalation, nuclear again

As NTV&#8217;s Zeynalova continued to ponder the issue of escalation, she invoked US diplomat George F. Kennan&#8217;s 1997 op-ed as an argument against Nato&#8217;s expansion (&#8220;A Fateful Error&#8221;). This, she said, is &#8220;hybrid war, in which any methods are being used&#8221;, complete with &#8220;fakes&#8221; and &#8220;discussions about nuclear use&#8221; and &#8220;statements about an imminent retaliatory offensive&#8221;; all &#8220;a game of escalation according to Kennan&#8217;s logic of an escalation ladder&#8221;. She went on to quote an unspecified essay in Responsible Statecraft, with the apparent suggestion that it was time for the West to push Ukraine towards negotiations. What with US President Joe Biden&#8217;s new Iran sanctions waiver and Nato Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoana&#8216;s reported remarks about the years of tense relations with Russia to come, Zeynalova said, there is a chance for de-escalation.&#160;

&#8220;Compared to statements about our strategic defeat, this may already mean something simple - there is a chance over the years to move away from the dangerous threshold with talk of nuclear use. If we use it, we will have a chance to find reasons to build new relationships. But, as Putin says, it takes two to tango,&#8221; Zeynalova said.

Here, on NTV, as on the other two channels, Putin&#8217;s assurances, in his interview with Kiselyov, that Russia is willing to negotiate about Ukraine provided Russia is given security guarantees were televised.&#160;

Putin&#8217;s latest nuclear rhetoric, also in his interview with Kiselyov, also made an appearance, in which he said Russia was ready for nuclear war &#8220;from a military-technical point of view&#8221;. But other than a long extract from Putin himself televised on Vesti Nedeli, it was not especially dwelt on in any of the commentary. If anything, it seemed to be purposely played down. The phrase &#8220;from a military-technical point of view&#8221; was present in Kiselyov&#8217;s account of this point from his interview with Putin, but the words &#8220;[ready] for nuclear war&#8221; contained in the question&#8217;s wording were absent, replaced as they were with Kiselyov&#8217;s comment that this appertained to the status of Russia&#8217;s strategic missile forces. Over on NTV, meanwhile, these words were omitted altogether, its relevant commentary confined to what Putin said about the newness of Russia&#8217;s nuclear triad, even though elsewhere in its commentary, rebuttal appeared mixed with satisfaction at the effect of Putin&#8217;s latest nuclear outburst.

&#8220;American propaganda assigns the role of the first strike to Vladimir Putin. Therefore, everything he said in the interview about the possibility of using nuclear weapons became a real bomb shell, even though the Americans themselves were not uninvolved in whipping up this hysteria. CNN reported last week that Russia was planning a nuclear strike on Ukraine at the end of 2022 and that the United States itself was carefully preparing for the consequences. A little earlier, meanwhile, the United States convinced the whole world that Russia was about to use nuclear weapons in space,&#8221; NTV&#8217;s story ran.

More Macron, &#8216;mercenaries&#8217;

As over the previous couple of weeks, Russian TV&#8217;s news reviews continued to be preoccupied with French President Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s series of pronouncements on Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine. There was extensive anti-Macron content especially on Rossiya 1 and NTV, plus a segment on Channel One.

Rossiya 1 was especially strident in its anti-Macron commentary. In his dispatch, inter alia, its Europe correspondent Mikhail Antonov described France&#8217;s ministerial duo of PM Gabriel Attal and Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne as &#8220;the homosexual pair, Attal and Sejourne, completely controlled&#8221; by Macron (the word &#8220;homosexual&#8221; present in the broadcast version but mysteriously absent from media monitoring service Medialogia&#8217;s text transcript).

Apparent contrast was served up with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#8217;s caution, with his refusal to supply Ukraine with the Taurus long-range cruise missile. Nevertheless, the channels felt it necessary to amplify warnings against such an eventuality. Further claims of a Nato split on support for Ukraine provided an accompaniment.

In the same report, incongruously (given Russia&#8217;s actions), Antonov asserted that any Taurus supplies to Ukraine would amount to an act of &#8220;aggression against a foreign state&#8221;, any such German involvement also &#8220;prohibited&#8221; by its constitution.

On Channel One, it invoked a 2022 &#8220;Ukrainian propaganda&#8221; production, its gist &#8220;to frighten the Germans with computer simulation of an ostensible missile attack on the centre of Berlin&#8221; (cue part of the montage where a member of the public in front of the Brandenburg Gate ducks in fear as an object like a missile streaks low over her). The question the report went on to pose was: &#8220;What if Kyiv strikes Russian targets but the Germans get hit [in retaliation]?&#8221;

Over on NTV, meanwhile, it discerned Macron&#8217;s attempt to walk back on some of his statements as he met Scholz and Polish PM Donald Tusk. &#8220;Perhaps to backtrack, on Friday in Germany, at a meeting with Scholz and Tusk, who had returned from Washington, Macron said that the [three] were not parties to the conflict and would never initiate escalation. Although Macron tried to present the alliance of the three countries as a single fist to fight Russia, there has been no talk of unity for a long time,&#8221; it said.

All this was combined with discourse about what was framed in unison as the use of &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; by Ukraine, on the back of the Russian Defence Ministry&#8217;s claims. The reports&#8217; usage was &#8220;soldiers of misfortune&#8221;, to convey the message of the inevitable fate that awaits them &#8211; death at the hands of the Russian military.

The Taliban have accused regional countries of failing to cooperate in the fight against drug smuggling and trafficking.","""Countries should fulfil their responsibilities.

""We have seized 4,450 tonnes of various drugs produced in Afghanistan... over the past five years,"" Tolo News TV quoted Eskandar Momeni - the secretary general of Iran&#8217;s Drug Control Headquarters - as saying.

Although several international organisations and commentators have voiced concerns over the past year about what they say is a rise in drug cultivation and smuggling out of Afghanistan, the Taliban have repeatedly rejected the reports, claiming that their 2022 national drug ban has been successful.

""According to the latest instructions from the main military-political directorate of the Russian Defence Ministry, the criteria for the identification of voters from among military personnel are simplified to the extent that there is no need for their physical participation in voting.

APRS000020240311ek3b00a15, Pakistan swears in newly elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's 19-member Cabinet ,ISLAMABAD (AP) — The 19-member Cabinet of Pakistan’s newly elected Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif was sworn into office on Monday and held its first meeting. The prime minister appointed several top government posts and promised to tackle the country's unrelenting economic crisis.,"Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari administered the oath of office to the ministers at the presidential office in the capital of Islamabad, with Sharif in attendance. Sharif was elected as prime minister by the parliament on Sunday, a month after parliamentary elections and after his Pakistan Muslim League-N party formed a coalition with several allies.

Sharif held the same position from April 2022 to August 2023, when he replaced archrival Imran Khan, a former cricket star turned Islamist politician who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly.

Sharif's new government faces daunting challenges, including an unprecedented economic crisis, regular power cuts, near-daily militant attacks and a challenging relationship with neighboring Taliban-run Afghanistan.

In televised remarks, Sharif vowed to improve the country's economy and contain rising inflation and halt price hikes during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. Ramadan for most Muslim countries started on Monday.

Sharif appointed lawmaker Ishaq Dar as foreign minister and re-appointed Khawaja Mohammad Asif as defense minister. Mohsin Naqvi, who served as caretaker chief minister in the eastern Punjab province, was appointed interior minister while Attaullah Tarar was named information minister.

The post of finance minister went to Muhammad Aurangzeb. The minister for climate change is yet to be selected from among the remaining ministers.

Zardari was appointed president on Saturday by the newly elected parliament. His office is mostly a ceremonial role and he is Sharif's main ally.

APRS000020240319ek3j00gqt, Top former US generals say failures of Biden administration in planning drove chaotic fall of Kabul ,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The top two U.S. generals who oversaw the evacuation of Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban in August 2021 blamed the Biden administration for the chaotic departure, telling lawmakers Tuesday that it inadequately planned for the evacuation and did not order it in time.

The rare testimony by former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and U.S. Central Command retired Gen. Frank McKenzie publicly exposed for the first time the strain and differences the military leaders had with the Biden administration in the final days of the war. Two of those key differences included that the military had advised that the U.S. keep at least 2,500 service members in Afghanistan to maintain stability and a concern that the State Department was not moving fast enough to get an evacuation started.","The remarks also contrasted with an internal White House review of the administration’s decisions which found that President Joe Biden’s decisions had been “severely constrained” by previous withdrawal agreements negotiated by former President Donald Trump and blamed the military, saying top commanders said they had enough resources to handle the evacuation.

Thirteen U.S. service members were killed by a suicide bomber at the Kabul airport's Abbey Gate in the final days of the war, as the Taliban took over Afghanistan.

Thousands of panicked Afghans and U.S. citizens desperately tried to get on U.S. military flights that were airlifting people out. In the end the military was able to rescue more than 130,000 civilians before the final U.S. military aircraft departed.

That chaos was the end result of the State Department failing to call for an evacuation of U.S. personnel until it was too late, Milley and McKenzie told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

“On 14 August the non-combatant evacuation operation decision was made by the Department of State and the U.S. military alerted, marshalled, mobilized and rapidly deployed faster than any military in the world could ever do,” Milley said.

But the State Department's decision came too late, Milley said.

“The fundamental mistake, the fundamental flaw was the timing of the State Department,” Milley said. “That was too slow and too late.""

In a lengthy statement late Tuesday, the National Security Council took issue with the generals' remarks, saying that Biden's hard decision was the right thing to do and part of his commitment to get the U.S. out of America's longest war.

The president “was not going to send another generation of troops to fight and die in a conflict that had no end in sight,” the NSC said. “We have also demonstrated that we do not need a permanent troop presence on the ground in harm’s way to remain vigilant against terrorism threats.”

The statement said the president and first lady still mourn for those lost at Abbey Gate and are “enormously proud of the men and women of our military, our diplomats and the intel community who conducted that withdrawal,” the NSC said.

In the hearing, which was prompted by a lengthy investigation by the House Foreign Affairs Committee into the decisions surrounding the evacuation of Kabul, McKenzie spoke at length about his discomfort in how little seemed to be ready for an evacuation, even raising those concerns with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Evacuation orders must come from the State Department, but in the weeks and months before Kabul fell to the Taliban, the Pentagon was still pressing the State Department for evacuation plans, McKenzie said.

“We had forces in the region as early as 9 July, but we could do nothing"" without State ordering the evacuation, McKenzie said, calling State’s timing “the fatal flaw that created what happened in August.”

“I believe the events of mid and late August 2021 were the direct result of delaying the initiation of the (evacuation) for several months, in fact until we were in extremis and the Taliban had overrun the country,"" McKenzie said.

Milley was the nation's top-ranking military officer at the time, and had urged President Joe Biden to keep a residual force of 2,500 forces there to give Afghanistan's special forces enough back-up to keep the Taliban at bay and allow the U.S. military to hold on to Bagram Air Base, which could have provided the military additional options to respond to Taliban attacks.

Biden did not approve the larger residual force, opting to keep a smaller force of 650 that would be limited to securing the U.S. embassy. That smaller force was not adequate to keeping Bagram, which was quickly taken over by the Taliban.

The Taliban have controlled Afghanistan since the U.S. departure, resulting in many dramatic changes for the population, including the near-total loss of rights for women and girls.

The White House found last year that the chaotic withdrawal occurred because President Joe Biden was “constrained” by previous agreements made by President Donald Trump to withdraw forces.

That 2023 internal review further appeared to shift any blame in the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, saying it was the U.S. military that made one possibly key decision.

“To manage the potential threat of a terrorist attack, the President repeatedly asked whether the military required additional support to carry out their mission at HKIA,” the 2023 report said, adding, “Senior military officials confirmed that they had sufficient resources and authorities to mitigate threats.”

BBCSAP0020240326ek3q000xd,Afghan TV discusses Moscow attack,"By BBC Monitoring

Afghan political commentators have condemned the IS-claimed attack in the Russian capital, calling for regional coordination against the ""common enemy"".","The 22 March assault, which claimed the lives of over 130 people at a concert hall on the outskirts of Moscow, came a day after another IS-claimed bombing killed over 20 people in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. Condemning the Moscow attack, the Taliban have called on the region to coordinate efforts against IS.

Speaking to Afghan Shamshad TV's Tawda Bahsona (Heated Discussions) talk show on 24 March, a Kabul-based analyst, Habibullah Janebdar reiterated the Taliban stance on the region's coordination, criticising regional countries for failing to recognise the ruling group and engaging in ""proper"" interaction with it.

""If there was coordination, such incidents would not have happened,"" he told Shamshad. ""Neighbouring countries should learn a good lesson from such incidents and engage in full interaction with Afghanistan if they really want to work for peace for their citizens.""

Janebdar lauded the Taliban fight against IS over the past three years of their return to power, saying that the group is preventing the threat to regional countries for free.&#160;

Asked what assistance Russia should provide to the Taliban in the fight against IS, Janebdar put recognition of the ruling group as the first step that Moscow should take followed by encouraging Russian investments in the country, saying that internal shortcomings of the Taliban should be set aside.

When asked about Russia's recent hosting of anti-Taliban figures' conference, he advised Moscow to ""learn a lesson from its past"" in Afghanistan, saying: ""Those pursuing good relations with Afghanistan make a gain, and those pursuing the policy of expansionism towards Afghanistan, be that the then policy of the Great Britain or tsarist Russia, have made a loss"".

Another analyst from Moscow, Yahya Chaosh, accused France and the US of being behind the Moscow assault, which according to him was carried out by Tajik nationals, saying that Paris is ""practically at war with Russia"".

According to him, France has established close ties with Tajikistan through ""fugitive"" anti-Taliban former Afghan government officials, who he alleged have allied with IS's Khorasan branch to fight the Taliban.

Asked what are the objectives behind the attacks in Kandahar and Moscow, Chaosh described IS as a ""common enemy created by Western intelligence to gain common interests in Afghanistan, Russia and other countries which oppose the policies of the United States of America"".

Asked how regional countries would be able to fend off the IS threat, Chaosh stressed the need for intelligence cooperation between regional countries, including Afghanistan, saying he believed that ""after his re-election, Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to have very close relations with Afghanistan"".

Another commentator, the US-based university lecturer Samsor Safi said: ""I would like to condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Kandahar and Moscow."" He alleged that Tajikistan and Pakistan were involved in orchestrating both the Kandahar and Moscow attacks, suggesting that these assaults were conducted under the ""direction of the West"". He warned that the recent growing ties between Pakistan and Tajikistan could pose a ""major threat"" to the region.

""These two are going against the normal tide in the region, and this normal tide is the fact that the world has now become bipolar with Russia, China and India being in the East block&#8230; whilst Tajikistan and Pakistan are acting in contrary, which clearly shows that they are guided by the other side.""&#160;

He also called on regional countries to cooperate with the Taliban in eliminating the ""common problem"", saying: ""The first thing Russia should do is to recognise the Afghan government, with China and Central Asia countries following suit.""

According to him, regional countries should hould refrain from blaming the Taliban's internal policies and focus on regional cooperation against the ""major threat"" of IS.

The Taliban government's acting minister of trade and industry, Hajji Nooruddin Azizi, has said that his country will cooperate with Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries on the basis of the principles of mutual consent in transboundary water use, the pro-government Turkmen news website Orient.tm reported on 4 March.","The Afghan minister made the remarks while addressing a Turkmen-Afghan business forum in the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat earlier in the day.

""In using transboundary water resources and building water facilities to improve the welfare of the Afghan people, Kabul will certainly be guided by the principles of mutual agreement, transparency and equality with neighbouring countries,"" Azizi said, as quoted by the website.

He specifically mentioned Turkmenistan, which he said has had friendly and good-neighbourly relations with Afghanistan for many years. He said that Turkmenistan had made a ""genuine"" contribution to Afghanistan's ""social and economic"" reconstruction.

In a separate report on 5 March, the pro-government Turkmen news website Infoabad.com said that Turkmenistan was in favour of cooperation in the use of transboundary water in accordance with international law.

""Our country advocates that water cooperation with neighbouring countries should be carried out in accordance with international law, on the basis of the principles of mutual respect, equality and transparency, in the spirit of traditional good-neighbourliness and brotherhood,"" the report said.

In March 2022, the Taliban government launched its controversial Qosh-Tepa Canal project. It will use water from the Amu Darya River that forms part of the border between Afghanistan and the Central Asian countries of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. There are concerns that the project may exacerbate the acute water shortage across Central Asia.

BBCSAP0020240326ek3q001gt,Indian daily says Moscow attack shows IS group on 'path to revival',"By BBC Monitoring

Influential Indian English-language daily The Hindu has said the Moscow concert attack indicated the Islamic State group is on a ""path to revival"", adding the group poses threat to the Eurasian region.","&#8220;The group, which once controlled territories across Syria and Iraq, has now transformed itself into a traditional terrorist outfit that hides in chaos and strikes on the public. The back-to-back attacks pose a serious security challenge to the Eurasian region, especially for Russia,&#8221; the paper said in an editorial on 26 March.

Recent attacks including&#160;the latest one at the Crocus City Hall that killed 137 people on 22 March point towards the ""terror capabilities"" of the jihadist group, it said.

The jihadist group&#8217;s Afghanistan-focused&#160;Khorasan Province branch (ISKP or ISIS-K), established in Afghanistan&#8217;s Nangarhar province in 2015, rose to prominence after the Taliban&#8217;s return to power in 2021, the editorial noted.

Since then, ISK has targeted Afghanistan&#8217;s Shia minority and sought to build a network of cells with youths from Central Asia and Afghanistan&#8217;s Tajik and Uzbek minorities.&#160;

&#8220;These networks are now gaining strength,&#8221; it said.

The group has been using anti-Russian and anti-Iranian propaganda to recruit members from Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

It said Russian President Vladimir Putin will have to &#8220;plug the security loopholes&#8221;, adding countries should address the geopolitical conditions that help the IS regroup.&#160;

&#8220;As long as the Taliban continues its Pashtun-only rule over a diverse, radicalised Afghanistan, and instability, wars and lawlessness prevail in parts of West Asia, groups such as the IS would continue to find avenues to grow and strike,&#8221; it said.

BBCSAP0020240327ek3r000gp,"Pakistan's Samaa News TV show on recent militant attack, political tensions","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Nadeem Malik Live"" hosted by anchor Nadeem Malik, a senior journalist and analyst, on moderate Samaa News TV in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 26 March 2024. The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Nadeem Malik said terrorism should be condemned no matter where it occurs in the world and noted incidents of terrorism have been taking place in Pakistan on a daily basis since the 9/11 attacks and thousands of civilians and military personnel have lost their lives due to this. He noted Chinese nationals were targeted in a militant attack on 26 March. He demanded this incident should be ""strongly condemned"" and elements behind the same should be traced.","Malik said ""political chaos"" has been continuing in the country and the courts have been hearing back-to-back cases. He remarked neither the cases come to a conclusion, nor does the unrest and uncertainty in the country come to an end.

Malik spoke with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and asked him who wants to damage Pakistan-China relations by attacking Chinese nationals. Chaudhry said the attack on Chinese nationals in Pakistan was very unfortunate. He noted China has significantly contributed to the development of Pakistan and is currently supporting Pakistan in construction of the Dasu dam. He remarked Chinese engineers had faced similar terror attacks in the area earlier as well but China's commitment to support Pakistan's development remains unwavering. He claimed there is evidence of Indian involvement in such acts in Pakistan and noted ""anti-Pakistan elements"" do not want to see stability in the country.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) politician Shehryar Khan Afridi said China is Pakistan's ""time-tested friend"" and has stood by the country in every situation. He was of the view that there should be zero tolerance on issues of national security. He termed India and Israel ""the biggest permanent enemies of Pakistan"" and said the country's enemies are working to exploit its ""fault lines"". He emphasised Pakistan needs to ""build unity"" and ""put its own house in order"". He insisted Pakistan should focus on improving relations with its neighbours and questioned why it is hostile towards the Taliban which was earlier in its favour.

Afridi complained political will and political leadership are nowhere to be seen at the moment when there is a need for Pakistan to engage with the world. He was of the view that there is a need to make a joint strategy by rising above party politics so that such incidents can be stopped.

Chaudhry said the government intends to engage all stakeholders but the opposition should also draw a line between fighting with political rivals and fighting against Pakistan. He emphasised Pakistan needs unity and consensus to resolve national issues and urged Afridi that his party [PTI] should show ""the same sentiments"" in the parliament and other relevant forums.

Afridi claimed he heard prisoners being tortured when he was in jail. However, he refused to talk about the torture that he faced. He argued security agencies are not able to focus on defending Pakistan's interests because they are involved in actions against political workers.&#160;

Chaudhry ""condemned"" physical torture of prisoners. Talking about concerns expressed by the PTI regarding threats to Imran Khan's (PTI founder) life, he said it is the government's responsibility to ensure his security.

Speaking about a drugs case that was filed against PML-N politician Rana Sanaullah under the PTI government, Afridi said he would urge the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir to investigate who implicated Sanaullah in the case.

BBCSAP0020240311ek3b000p1,Pakistan paper notes 'significant security risk' over militants from Afghanistan,"By BBC Monitoring

An editorial in English-language Pakistani newspaper Daily Times has highlighted the ""significant security risk"" posed by militants from Afghanistan, saying it has ""long been a hotbed for terrorist activities"".","Daily Times is a moderate newspaper, which is generally critical of jihadist groups.

""Pakistan continues to make a case for across-the-border attacks from Afghanistan, asking the international community to take action and force the Taliban to cut off their ties with the militant organisations spreading havoc in all parts of the country,"" the paper said on 10 March.&#160;

The editorial referred to the recent military operation where ten militants from Afghanistan were killed.

It lauded the security forces' efforts in protecting the borders and maintaining national security.

""But it can still not be overlooked how Afghanistan has long been a hotbed for terrorist activities, with various extremist groups finding safe havens within its borders,"" it said.&#160;

""The close proximity of Afghanistan to neighbouring countries poses a significant security risk, as terrorists attempt to infiltrate and carry out attacks in these regions,"" it added.

""Terrorist organizations continue to exploit porous borders, seeking to establish sleeper cells and launch attacks within target countries,"" it further said.

Highlighting some of the challenges, the paper said that ""the vast and often rugged terrain, coupled with the porosity of borders, makes it difficult to monitor and intercept infiltrators.""

""Moreover, the presence of local populations and the complexities of cross-border relations further complicate the efforts,"" it added.&#160;

In order to overcome these challenges, the editorial said that Pakistan needed ""the support of the entire fraternity so that a deliberations table can be set up; those calling the shots in our western neighbour can be brought on board and we can collectively make efforts for a peaceful region.""

BBCSAP0020240329ek3t000dx,Pakistan's PTV show on growing cases of militancy,"The following is a summary of the talk show ""Riasat"" (The State), hosted by anchor Shahzad Raza on state-owned PTV News in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 28 March 2024. The programme provides analysis and views of experts and politicians on important news of the day.

Anchor Shahzad Raza commented the forces which are working against the interests of Pakistan are based abroad and their facilitators are active inside the country. He said Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies have remained vigilant and have ""foiled numerous attempts"" of militant attacks. Questioning how the ""enemy"" sitting abroad is able to carry out such actions, he claimed there are elements in Pakistan who ""act as tools in the hands of the enemies"".&#160;","Raza asked defence analyst Ijaz Malik who has been facilitating the country's enemies. Malik said it is not a new phenomenon that some people become ""agents of the enemy states or non-state actors"" for personal or group interests. He added ""fifth-generation warfare"" has many dimensions and those involved in it never get to know the real objectives. He further said those elements are ""brainwashed by their handlers"" who use issues which are ""sellable"", for example, religion can be used to motivate any person.

Commenting on the recent attacks targeting Chinese nationals and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC, mega development project) projects, Malik said it should be seen who are the likely beneficiaries of these attacks. He noted if the Chinese are targeted, it would put a question mark on continuity of the projects they were working on and would also have an impact on the relations between the two countries. He questioned how foreign investors would come to Pakistan if such attacks continue.

Raza asked Munawar Hasan, an expert on international affairs, whether people involved in militancy can be convinced through dialogue that they are following the wrong path. Hasan said, ""In the past, we tried holding dialogue, yet these elements have existed and have been attacking Pakistan's vital and strategic interests"". He emphasised Pakistan needs a ""two-pronged strategy"", which means diplomacy should continue with Afghanistan and ""kinetic force should be used to maintain deterrence"" within Pakistani borders. He noted the Pakistani armed forces are a conventional force, while ""terrorists engage in guerrilla warfare"". He expressed the view that ""fifth-generation warfare"" is being carried out by those who do not want connectivity in the region and are ""enemies of the CPEC"".

Defence analyst Waqar Khan said when the Taliban government took over [in Afghanistan], there was confidence that there would be stability in Afghanistan as the Afghans would be in the government after the withdrawal of the Unites States (US), but unfortunately like all other Afghan governments in the last 40 years, the Taliban government also believes that it can ""draw some concessions by using terrorism as a tool of policy"". He noted the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government tried to give them some concessions but the Taliban had a ""greater design"". He mentioned in a recent video clip of a Taliban leader, he can be seen talking about ""international jihad"" and ""expansion of war"", which reflects ""greater designs"" of the Taliban. He claimed ""India has also jumped in"" after which attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan have increased. He was of the view that terrorism cannot be used as a ""policy tool"" for very long.

Malik was of the view that militants have not been eliminated completely because the environment of the ""nurseries in which they are nurtured"" has not changed. He insisted unless an alternate source of livelihood, social uplift and sense of well-being is provided, these people would remain vulnerable to ""any kind of recruitment"". He recalled special economic zones and large-scale development was promised but has not been delivered, so the position of Afghanistan has remained unchanged.

Hasan said Pakistan will have to rely on its own resources in its fight against militancy and should seek cooperation from alternative centres of power at the regional level. He noted the Taliban's decision-making has been weak as they are still in the ""guerrilla warfare mode"". He claimed investments from China and Turkey have given the Taliban confidence and they have started thinking that they can pressurise Pakistan, but they cannot do so.

Hasan criticised the US policy on Afghanistan and said due to ""contradictory"" international policies, ""American influence has been eroding all around the world"" and an ""anti-US sentiment"" has been rising. He argued Pakistan had supported the US in its war against terror, so it should be supporting Pakistan at the time when it is facing threats from militants. He remarked if the US does not cooperate, Pakistan would ""obviously look for alternative options"".

BBCSAP0020240308ek380002t,Iran alleges rise in synthetic drugs trafficking from Afghanistan,"By BBC Monitoring

Iran has voiced concern over the reported increase in synthetic drug trafficking from Afghanistan despite the Afghan Taliban's claims that trafficking of illicit drugs to Iran has reduced by 90 per cent, private Channel One (1TV)&#160;reported on 6 March.","Iskandar Momeni, the secretary-general of Iran's Drug Control Headquarters, said that there has been no significant decline in drug trafficking from Afghanistan into Iran, the report said.

""Taliban officials, who visited Iran, said during talks [with Iranian officials] that poppy cultivation and opium production had decreased. They said that narcotics are in the warehouses, and once they run out, drug trafficking into Iran may be reduced by 90 per cent. However, Iran is witnessing an increase in production of industrial drugs, in particular methamphetamine and crystal, in the country,"" citing Iranian media outlets channel quoted Momeni as saying.

Some political and military commentators interviewed in the report said that Afghanistan is no longer the origin of opium production and that Iran's claims of an increase in poppy production in Afghanistan are baseless.

""The main origin and source of opium production in Afghanistan, which is poppy cultivation, has been destroyed. I do not think 90 per cent of drugs are trafficked into Iran because large-scale drug trafficking from Afghanistan has ceased,"" Mohammad Seyal, another commentator, told the channel.

""The Iranian people and government's claim about drug trafficking in Afghanistan is wrong. We have seen that over the past two years and a half, the Islamic Emirate [the Taliban administration] has been carrying out a strong fight against the production and cultivation of narcotics in Afghanistan. There could be a possibility that Afghanistan's drugs were seized in Iran. I want to say that, in the past, most of the narcotics were transferred to Pakistan and then to other countries. May be, it was stored there and transferred to Iran via Pakistan,"" military analyst Kamran Aman said.

In the meantime, the Interior Ministry of the Taliban administration has said that they have cleared nearly 200,000 acres of land for poppy cultivation in several provinces, the channel added.

The Taliban administration has regularly rejected reports on the increase in poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, urging the international community to help support Afghanistan in eradicating the drugs, the TV report added.

Afghan commentators appearing on the private Ariana News TV's&#160;Tahawol (Change) debate programme&#160;on 20 March discussed Pakistan's policy towards Afghanistan and the former's decision to resume the deportation of Afghan migrants lacking proper documents.","""We will deport all the migrants, including Afghans, who do not have legal and migration documents. Nobody can stay in Pakistan without valid documents. We also seek to accelerate the process further,"" the channel showed Pakistani Minister of Interior Affairs&#160;Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi&#160;saying, with superimposed translation into Dari.

Meanwhile, Taliban de facto authorities have said that they want Afghan refugees to return to the country voluntarily.

""We want the refugees to return to Afghanistan. We encourage them to voluntarily come to Afghanistan so that they are not coerced to do so&#8230; The migrants must return, and efforts should be made that they are no longer used as a pressure tool by countries,"" the channel showed Taliban Spokesman&#160;Zabihullah Mujahid&#160;saying.&#160;

When asked why Pakistan has decided to resume the deportation of Afghan refugees, political commentator Bashir Hatif said: ""There is no doubt that Pakistan wants to put continuous pressure on Afghanistan as it is fully aware of the current situation, including the humanitarian and economic crisis, in Afghanistan. Given that, Pakistan is trying to find different pressure tools against Afghanistan.""

""There is no doubt that the commencement of the process of the migrants' expulsion can create challenges and problems for Afghanistan. But the question is why Pakistan resorts to such measures. We all know that Pakistan has some long-pending demands. It has also made new demands over the past two and a half years [since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in August 2021],"" Hatif said further.

About Pakistan&#8217;s demands from Afghanistan, he said: ""One of the main demands is that Afghanistan should always follow Pakistan in its foreign policy. I want to say, in other words, that Pakistan has been and is trying to manage Afghanistan's foreign relations.""

Hatif added that Pakistan has been marginalised on the issue of Afghanistan.&#160;

""Qatar has taken the position of Pakistan [regarding Afghanistan]. Qatar has been playing an active role in mediating between Afghanistan and the international community. Afghanistan, the US and all countries are now paying more attention to Qatar than Pakistan,"" he told the programme.&#160;

Joining the programme online, Switzerland-based political commentator Rahmat Hassan said that Pakistan is seeking to turn Afghanistan into its ""fifth province.""

Hassan said: ""Pakistan has a long history of differences with the people and the nation of Afghanistan. Since Pakistan was separated from the undivided India [in 1947], its relations with Afghanistan have been sour, and&#160;the recent airstrikes&#160;[in eastern Afghanistan] are not something new. Over the past 50 years, it has carried out bombardments on Afghanistan. What does Pakistan want from the people of Afghanistan? Pakistan's main and strategic goal is to turn Afghanistan into its fifth province.""

When asked why Pakistan has always voiced concern about security threats emanating from Afghanistan, Hassan said: ""Neither Pakistan nor Iran want Afghanistan to have a powerful centralised government and a powerful nation that can stand on their own feet. They have always wanted Afghanistan to be in peril and be a servant as well as a puppet.""

Commenting on the deportation of Afghan refugees, US-based political pundit Zaman Stanikzai, who joined the debate online, said: ""If the refugees return to Afghanistan from Pakistan, Pakistanis will not have any tool to pressure Afghanistan or the Afghan government.""

Stanikzai said that the Taliban administration should spare no effort to gain the full support of Afghan nationals to get rid of Pakistan's continuous pressure.

""The Taliban need to win people's trust and support. They should also demonstrate flexibility in their policy towards women [in Afghanistan]. As far as the nation supports the Taliban, they should not be worried about anything,"" concluded Stanikzai.&#160;

BBCSAP0020240327ek3r002mh,"Pro-ISKP outlet celebrates IS attack in Moscow, warns of more to come","By BBC Monitoring

A high-profile pro-Islamic State group&#160;(IS) media outlet has commented on the Moscow concert hall attack, describing it as retaliation for losses suffered by IS due to Russian military activity in Syria.","It also emphasised that civilian citizens of ""belligerent"" countries are legitimate targets for jihadist violence.

The al-Azaim&#160;media group made the comments in a 30-page Pashto-language statement titled ""Moscow Attack: Mourning and Fear of Militias"", which was published on 25 March via pro-IS accounts on Telegram and RocketChat.

Other than the Syria angle, the statement did not offer new or original information about the attack or its perpetrators.&#160;

But it did warn that ISKP attacks will not be limited to Afghanistan and will target all countries supporting the Afghan Taliban, singling out China, Iran, and Russia for further attacks.

The Taliban is a staunch enemy of ISKP and is generally the primary target of al-Azaim's rhetoric.&#160;

The media group operates as an unofficial mouthpiece for IS's Khorasan Province branch (ISKP), which operates in Afghanistan and parts of north-western Pakistan.

Justifying attacks on civilians

In its statement, al-Azaim expressed jubilation over the loss of civilian lives in the assault on the concert hall in Moscow on 22 March. The attack, claimed to have been carried out by IS militants,&#160;resulted in the deaths of approximately 140 people and left over 180 wounded.&#160;

Al-Azaim endorsed the targeting of Russian civilians, justifying it as retaliation for the deaths of IS members and their families in Russian military operations in Syria.&#160;

This appeared to echo IS's official line on 23 March, when a statement by the group indicated that the attack was revenge against Russia, without saying over which issue.

The latest al-Azaim statement also argued that Russian citizens' tax contributions facilitated their military's actions against IS in Syria, suggesting that these citizens thus tacitly supported such operations.

It is probable that al-Azaim's justification for civilian killings is meant to convey the message to IS supporters that killing the citizens of any country participating in the war against IS anywhere is warranted.

A central theme in the statement was challenging the Taliban's alleged suggestions that ISKP receives covert support from Pakistan and Tajikistan.

It countered that if ISKP had alliances with Pakistan or Tajikistan, it would not target those countries. And yet, it continued, the group has carried out major recent attacks in Pakistan, citing a July 2023 suicide bombing in Bajaur and an IED attack in the same region in January.

Al-Azaim also highlighted the 2022 ISKP missile attack on Tajikistan's border forces from Afghan soil as contradictory to the Taliban's claims.

Moreover, the statement rejected the assertion from Taliban supporters that ISKP serves US interests. It cited the death of US soldiers in an ISKP suicide attack at Kabul Airport in August 2021, along with the pivotal role of US forces in dismantling ISKP's territorial grip in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, as evidence refuting these claims.

Azerbaijan's ambassador in Kabul, Ilham Mohammadov, has announced that Baku has opened its embassy in Kabul, indicating that the two countries share amicable relations, the private Tolo News TV channel&#160;reported on 22 March.","He made the remark in a meeting with the Taliban government's deputy prime minister for administrative affairs,&#160;Abdul Salam Hanafi, in Kabul.&#160;

Mohammadov stated that Baku and Kabul support each other's independence and pursue policies of non-interference in their respective affairs.

The Taliban government's chief spokesman,&#160;Zabihullah Mujahid, gave the following brief about the meeting: ""At the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations between the two countries. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [Afghan Taliban de facto government] has expressed readiness to expand diplomatic and economic relations with Azerbaijan.""

Political commentators said that the Taliban government needs to improve and expand its ties with the world.

""Any country that opens its embassy or plays a role in Afghanistan benefits the people of Afghanistan and the Islamic Emirate,"" said Salim Paigir, a political commentator.

Over the past month, delegations from various countries have visited Afghanistan and held talks with representatives of the Taliban government. Some commentators interviewed by the channel discussed the significance of the Taliban administration's diplomatic meetings.

""Regional countries fear an attack from Afghanistan; therefore, they share their concern with the Islamic Emirate. I think that regional countries want to see an inclusive government in Afghanistan. Therefore, they are encouraging the Islamic Emirate to take steps in this regard,"" opined Mohammad Sangar Amirzada, an expert on international affairs.

BBCSAP0020240321ek3l00335,TV talk show analysts call for Afghans' unity against Pakistan,"By BBC Monitoring

The recent air strikes by Pakistan in southeast Afghanistan continue to elicit reactions among Afghan commentators who have called on the Taliban to strengthen domestic unity against the neighbouring country.","Speaking on the private Shamshad TV's Tawda Bahsona (Heated Discussions) talk show on 19 March, Kamran Aman, a Kabul-based commentator and former colonel, described the strikes in Khost and Paktika provinces as a ""blatant and shameless aggression by the Pakistani army"".

""The Afghan nation should give a decisive response to it,"" he said.

Aman called on clerics to issue a ""fatwa [islamic verdict] of jihad against the enemy"", saying that ""it is obligatory on the entire nation to defend their land and dignity.""

""Aggression should be responded with aggression,"" the commentator further said.

When asked against whom jihad is obligatory, Aman said: ""Against any country which encroaches into Afghan territory and kills Afghans - even if it is one Afghan.""

He lauded the Taliban's retaliatory ground attacks but called on the group to set up a national committee to strengthen unity and prepare plans to tackle future attacks by the neighbouring country.

""Yesterday, they did what they could &#8211; Well done. I wish I had been there at that time as well. We are awaiting the order of the honourable defence minister to say - Afghans, come out for the war,"" he said, answering a query about his thoughts on the Taliban's retaliation.

In reply to a question about the consequences for Pakistan, if it repeats attacks in the future, the former colonel said: ""It would have a very heavy price for the Pakistani nation &#8211; a price they would end up paying for the actions of a few of their government authorities.""

Commenting on the military capability of the two countries, Aman lauded the ""high morale"" of Taliban forces, saying that Pakistani forces have ""rockets but lack faith and morale"".

Another Kabul-based commentator, former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Mawlawi Abdul Salam Zaeef, also called for unity among Afghans but suggested diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue with Pakistan.

""We should never get into a fight with Pakistan,"" he said. ""There must be a reciprocal reaction to an action, but not more than that. Moreover, efforts should be stepped up for national unity,"" he added.

Zaeef warned Islamabad to ""realise that Afghanistan is not a geography which would submit to others' orders"", adding: ""The use of force is a futile attempt here. There must be mutual respect instead.""

He blamed the current economic crisis in Pakistan on its ""despotic army"", saying that it has political and security issues with all its neighbours, including Afghanistan, India, Iran and China.

The former Taliban diplomat further said that by attacking Afghanistan, the ""despotic"" Pakistani army ""wants to divert Pakistani people's attention from its failures, incompetence and political instability in Pakistan"".

When asked about the international community's ""silence"" on the Afghan-Pakistan tensions, Zaeef accused other countries of trying to ""use"" the deterioration of relations between the neighbouring countries as a tool to put pressure on the ruling Taliban, but advised the group to contemplate about its priorities, including engagement with the world, education and ""nation building"".

Asked whether Pakistan would change its policy towards Afghanistan, he said that Islamabad's approach towards Kabul will ""never change as long as Pakistan's military is its policy-maker.""

A commentator from Germany, Torialay Zazai, also urged the Taliban to strengthen internal unity and ""encourage national mobilisation against Pakistan.""

He called on the Taliban leadership to ""retaliate to one bullet with 10"", adding that ""now the situation is not for dialogue"". Zazai accused Pakistan of ""trying to show to the world that there is no stability in the region"", saying that Islamabad ""wants to extract money from the international community"" on the Afghan issue.

""If the world wants to eliminate terrorists in the world, they should partition and isolate Pakistan. This will free the world of terrorism,"" he further said.

Another Kabul-based commentator, Shahzada Massoud, also called on the Taliban to strengthen national unity.

""The most urgent thing the Islamic Emirate [Taliban administration] needs to do at the current juncture is to convene a traditional Loya Jirga [traditional grand assembly of elders] and decide on all issues, including engagement with the international community,"" the commentator said.

According to him, the ruling group should do some of its ""homework"", including lifting their ban on women's education, which he believed was crucial for their international recognition. Describing Pakistan's air strikes as a ""blatant violation of Afghanistan's national sovereignty"", Massoud said: ""This was not their first attack, neither would it be the last. Pakistan has often shelled Kunar, Paktia, Paktika.""

""Pakistan is weak at the moment, although we wish it was not so. Its economy is stagnating, and political stability is worsening. In other words, what remains of Pakistan now is just its skeleton,"" he said, answering a question about the consequences for Pakistan.

Afghan commentators appearing on the private Ariana News TV's&#160;Tahawol (Change) debate programme&#160;on 26 March discussed a Pakistani economic delegation's&#160;recent visit to Afghanistan&#160;amid the deteriorating relations between the two countries.&#160;","When asked why the Pakistani delegation arrived in Kabul just a week after Islamabad carried out&#160;airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, Taliban commander Abdul Hamid Khorasani said: ""If tensions and issues emerge between neighbouring countries, it [such visit] is used as a normal procedure to maintaining better political ties.""

""I would like to point out that political ties between the two countries have been outstanding since the beginning of the one specific case [airstrikes] or even before it happened and till now. Ambassadors from both countries have been carrying out their tasks till now. But the problem [presumably refers to the airstrikes and the&#160;retaliatory attacks by the Taliban] was between the Pakistani military and military forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [the Taliban de facto government],"" Khorasan added.

He further said: ""The Pakistani military committed a stupid act by hitting civilian targets. And they are executing the US's and West's ominous projects in the name of [fighting] terrorism... Mujahideen [Taliban fighters] and border units have given proper response [the retaliatory attacks] to their stupid action&#8230; Meanwhile, a delegation from Pakistan has arrived in Afghanistan to improve the relations, which is a normal process.""

Khorasani said that although the Taliban administration has been seeking to maintain good relations with all neighbouring countries, neighbours have made ""unfounded"" allegations and Pakistan, which he said was not independent, implements the ""West's projects"".&#160;

Rejecting the allegations that the Taliban backs and shelters militants who are hostile to Islamabad, he said: ""It is a baseless allegation. There is no truth in it at all. I have always said in discussions that if Pakistani authorities have sufficient evidence to prove the presence of hideouts and bases of their opponents in the territory of Afghanistan, why have they not shared them with media outlets, people and the international community? It is a period of technology. They can bomb civilian houses, but why do they not video record the basses and share the clips with the Islamic Emirate and the international community? So, it is a baseless claim.""

Concluding, Khorasani warned of serious consequences if Pakistan continues to carry out airstrikes or interfere in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan.

Pro-Taliban political commentator Hatif Mukhtar, who joined the debate at the TV studio in Kabul, insisted that Pakistan should alter its strategy and should not interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.&#160;

""Pakistan should understand that Afghanistan is not its colony. It is a free and independent country. Pakistan does not have the right to interfere in our domestic affairs. On the other hand, we interact with Pakistan in line with our national interests,"" he said.

""In the current sensitive, difficult and historical situation, our national interests suggest that we should have good relations with Pakistan. Pakistan should also have good relations with us. It is Pakistan which should pave the way for this to happen. As far as we are concerned, we do not interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs in any circumstances.&#160;The TTP&#160;is an internal issue of Pakistan,"" the pro-Taliban commentator said.

When asked what is the solution to address the problems between the two countries, Mukhtar said: ""Pakistan can make investments in Afghanistan. As a brotherly and friendly country, Pakistan should not interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Pakistan should resolve the issue of TTP and Baluchis by themselves. We will never interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has adopted a balanced, impartial and strategic policy under which we want to be friends with Pakistan. We want to have relations with Pakistan.""

Speaking on the programme at the channel's studio in Kabul, pro-Taliban political commentator Abdul Haq Emad described the visit as ""an important"" step towards strengthening the ties between Kabul and Tashkent.

Emad said: ""I see the visit by the Uzbek foreign minister as an important step towards strengthening ties between Uzbekistan and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [Taliban]. This is the first time [since the Taliban came to power in August 2021] that the Uzbek foreign minister is visiting Afghanistan. He visited Afghanistan along with a plenipotentiary delegation.""

""He has met senior officials from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. This comes at a time when relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have got closer than in the past,"" added Emad.

Speaking about the Taliban's policy towards neighbouring countries, Emad said: ""When the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan came to power [in August 2021], it started taking measures for good relations with neighbours. It pursued the policy of mutual respect and a balanced policy between the West and the East. It has adhered to all the principles of trade, diplomacy and good neighbourliness, which two good neighbours usually follow.""&#160;

He further said that the world, including Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, has concluded that the Taliban government is ""the reality"" that can resolve the issues that emerged in Afghanistan over the past 45 years.

Emad said: ""Not only regional countries and neighbours, but also the world has realised that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the reality which can deal with the 45-year-long issues of Afghanistan and, at the same time, can interact with neighbouring countries, the world and the region. Therefore, the neighbouring countries have decided to engage in diplomatic interaction with Afghanistan at the highest level.""

When asked why Uzbekistan has declined to hand over Afghan helicopters to the Taliban government, another political commentator, Asif Wardak, who joined the debate in the TV studio, said: ""As a Muslim and neighbour country, it should hand them over to Afghanistan&#8230; It will not have good consequences if it [Uzbekistan] does not do so.""

The Afghan helicopters were&#160;taken to neighbouring countries, especially&#160;Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, after the collapse of the West-backed government in Kabul in August 2021.&#160;

Wardak added that neighbouring countries, especially Iran, cannot ask the Taliban government to form an inclusive government because they also lack such a system.&#160;

Wardak said: ""There are Baluch, Kurd and Arab ethnic groups as well as Sunnis [in Iran]. Can you [Iran] tell us how many members of your cabinet are from the aforementioned ethnic groups? Meanwhile, Tajikistan should try to renounce its hypocrisy [presumably refers to its policy towards the Taliban government]. It is not good to continue it. Everything has its own limits.

Speaking on the programme, London-based analyst Habibullah Janebdar called on Sharif's administration to reconsider his country's ""brutal past policies"" towards Afghanistan and said that normalising ties would be in Pakistan's interests.&#160;

""But if this government, like its predecessors, lack independence, it will find it difficult to normalise relations with Afghanistan or its other neighbours,"" he added.&#160;

When asked what ""mistakes"" previous Pakistani governments had done in dealing with Afghanistan, Janebdar referred to the recent forced deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and the neighbouring country's ""unnecessary restrictions"" on Afghan traders.

""Pakistani authorities should desist from the policy of hate towards Afghans and stop insults at borders,"" he added.&#160;

When asked whether the new government would be able to manage&#160;the current economic and security crisis in Pakistan, he said: ""It will be very difficult to manage the crisis... They are at a crossroad. There are two possibilities. They might end up in a worse situation or attain relative stability.""&#160;

Another analyst at the TV studio in Kabul, Dr Moeen Gul Samkanai, also called on the new government to normalise ties with the Taliban, saying: ""Given their economic and security crisis, they should play a constructive role in trade so they can send their goods to Central Asia, and we can send ours to Indian and other markets"".&#160;

""Apart from this, they should refrain from levelling accusations against the Afghan government and, instead, do their own homework,"" he added, in reference to repeated allegations from Pakistani authorities that militant groups have been using Afghanistan's territory to plan and conduct attacks.&#160;

When asked about the prospects of Pakistan and Afghan Taliban relations under the new government, Samkanai replied: ""Civilian governments will come and go, but the strategy and policy will remain in the hands of the army.""

""Civilian governments will continue playing their symbolic roles, but not strategic,"" he added.&#160;

When asked whether Shehbaz Sharif would be able to resolve his country's crisis, Samkanai answered: ""I do not think so.""

He described the controversial elections in Pakistan as ""rigged"" and stated: ""After Nawaz [Sharif] was called from London, it was obvious that they [Pakistani army] would bring the Nawaz family to power.""

""I would say there was fraud for sure,"" he alleged.&#160;

Commenting on the economic crisis in Pakistan, Samkanai said that Islamabad is now ""stuck between China and America"", adding: ""China has projects there and America does not want China to implement its projects.""&#160;

The other commentator, a Pakistani journalist from Islamabad, Tahir Khan stated his belief that ""Afghanistan will be a big challenge"" for the Shehbaz Sharif administration.

Khan advised the new government to pursue good relations with Kabul, which he said has managed to strengthen trade ties with Iran - through which the Taliban can use as an alternative transit route.&#160;

The commentator also admitted that his country is going through a ""very difficult political crisis"".&#160;

When asked whether the Pakistani people were satisfied with the results of the elections, Khan replied: ""There is distrust. It would not be right if I were to say that yes, the public is happy.""&#160;

""Apart from Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and, to some extent, the Pakistan People's Party, all other parties are not happy with the results of the elections,"" Khan added.&#160;

When asked what challenges the new government was facing, Khan listed the economic crisis at top of the challenges which Sharif's government would struggle to address, saying: ""Pakistan does need international loans as its economy is not good at all.""&#160;

""There is inflation. People are facing difficulties with electricity, gas and fuel prices skyrocketing,"" he stated, adding that ""it would be very difficult"" for the Shehbaz Sharif administration to manage the crisis.&#160;

""Without any doubt, these aircraft belong to the US. They take off from neighbouring countries and enter Afghanistan. Everyone should understand their responsibilities in this matter and stop the aggression,"" Mujahid said.

The Taliban spokesman did not name any country, but he called on neighbouring countries to stop allowing the US from using their airspace to enter Afghan airspace.

""If today two foreign planes are patrolling Afghanistan's airspace, such movements will increase tomorrow. Bomber planes will come, and Afghanistan will [again] be occupied,"" Abdul Wahid Taqat, a political commentator, said.

""Unfortunately, Afghanistan does not have air defence forces and radar, so any country can violate Afghanistan's airspace if it wants,"" said Sarwar Niazi, another commentator.

It was reported earlier that drones were seen patrolling Kandahar and Nimruz provinces of Afghanistan.

""We signed a total of 100 contracts, 30 of them with [traders from] the friendly county of Iran,"" Samiullah Faqiri, the deputy head of Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel, told the channel.

Mawlawi Ahmad Jan Bilal, the head of the leadership board of state-run companies and the Taliban leader's special representative, emphasised that Afghanistan, as a country that has recently emerged from a war, ""has a right on its neighbours"" for them to support the country's economic development.

BBCSAP0020240309ek3900001,TV talk show discusses new Pakistan government's likely Afghan policies,"By BBC Monitoring

Afghan political commentators have expressed pessimism about the prospects for normalisation of relations between Pakistan and the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. They said that the new Pakistan government will ""remain at odds with Afghanistan like its predecessors"".","Following last month's controversial Pakistan elections, Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, was sworn in as the country's new prime minister on 4 March. &#160;Speaking to Shamshad TV's Tawda Bahsona (Heated Discussions) talk show on 7 March, Kabul-based commentator Amanullah Hotaki advised the Taliban's de facto government to ""always play tricks with Pakistan"", saying that Islamabad ""does not deserve sympathy and brotherhood"".

""Pakistan does not want a centralised government in Afghanistan &#8211; it wants a weak government and war here. This has been Pakistan's policy since its very inception and formation,"" he added.

Hotaki advised the Pakistani new government ""not to bully"" Afghanistan, warning that ""whoever has bullied has been caught in its traps"".

""Pakistan is now paying a price for what it was seeking in Afghanistan,"" he added in reply to a question about which mistakes Pakistan is paying a price for, given the current crisis in the country.

""Over the past 40 years, I have [Afghanistan has] continuously been bitten by Pakistan. Why &#8211; because it is the hireling of others,"" he further noted, accusing Britain of being behind the victory of Sharif's family, who were believed to be the Pakistani army's favoured choice to head the new government.

He also said that Shahbaz Sharif's coalition government will ""not yield any outcome"", adding that tensions with its opposition will continue.

Torialay Zazai, a Germany-based Afghan analyst, accused the Sharif family, including Shahbaz's elder brother Nawaz Sharif, of ""destroying"" the Afghan army in the 1990s.

""Shahbaz's family is the puppet of British and American intelligence... Pakistan is not independent. Its ISI [intelligence agency] as well as army are controlled by the British and the Americans,"" he added.

In reply to a question about what policy the new government should adopt towards Kabul, Zazai said: ""Whatever may be the policy of Pakistan, it will be against Afghanistan."" ""Pakistan is an enemy and will remain an enemy.""

However, referring to allegations levelled by the supporters of the jailed former prime minister, Imran Khan, that the election process was rigged, he said: ""I do not think their [Sharif's] government will last even a year.""

Asked how good Sharif's coalition administration would prove for Pakistan, he said: ""It will not have any result as they lack authority.""

Zazai also accused Islamabad of backing anti-Taliban Afghan opposition politicians, calling on the ruling Taliban to strengthen domestic unity to ""rescue Afghanistan"".

Pro-Taliban commentator Mawlana Abdul Jabbar Stanekzai also said that ""the new [Pakistani] government, as their predecessors, will remain at odds with Afghanistan"".

""Their army controls it, and it will do whatever the army tells,"" he said.

Asked whether the Shahbaz Sharif administration would not have any influence on the country's Afghanistan policy, Stanekzai said: ""They never had any influence regarding Afghanistan. As I said, it now depends on the army - whether it wants good or bad relations with Afghanistan.""

Commenting on protests against election rigging in Pakistan, he said: ""The Pakistani nation wants their country to be run by someone who is not a thief.""

He added that the neighbouring country faces ""far more problems"" than Afghanistan.

Accusing Pakistan of ""fuelling"" civil wars in Afghanistan, the pro-Taliban commentator, however, thanked the neighbouring country for helping Afghans in the fights against the ""Soviets and Americans"".&#160;

Gen Mujib Shamsan, a member of the military council of the Yemeni armed forces, said in an interview that the Israeli ""Zionist regime"" has achieved nothing in Gaza except the indiscriminate killing of women, children and civilians.","In an&#160;exclusive interview&#160;with the Taliban-controlled Hewad Daily newspaper on 4 March, Shamsan emphasised how Yemeni Houthis and other anti-Israel groups have inflicted casualties and financial damages to the US, UK, and Israeli targets by attacking their commercial and military ships.

""Considering the reality of the war between the Palestinian resistance and the Zionist regime in Gaza, one can say that five months into the war, the Zionist regime has had no achievements except for the genocide of civilians. The genocide of civilians, children and women in response to the Palestinian resistance&#8230; shows that the Palestinian resistance has so far been successful,"" the newspaper quoted Shamsan.

Shamsan has also said that the attacks on US, UK and Israeli ships by Houthis and other anti-Israel groups could result in the victory of the Palestinian resistance.

""The events in Gaza have revealed the conflict's feature - a religious war led by the Zionist regime and imperialist Western forces,"" Shamsan said.

He warned that if Islamic countries do not come to the aid of the people of Gaza, the repercussions of the war will extend beyond Gaza. He said that in the future, other Islamic nations will also be forced to face the ""brutality and barbarism of Western countries.""

Shamsan has said the US and UK strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen would not affect the capability of the Houthis because the US and UK have been bombarding the same targets over the past eight years.

""What makes Yemen&#8217;s position different from the rest of the world is that it [Yemeni position] is an official position which also corresponds with the position of the people. The position of other Arab governments are positions of friendship combined with weakness of the Americans and Zionists,"" Shamsan has said.

""The effectiveness of Yemen's stance is evident in the impact of its operations against the Zionist regime, America and Britain. The impact is undeniable,"" he further said that 54 American, British and Israeli ships have been targeted.

Michoacan’s state security agency said on X, formerly Twitter, that three members of the state Civil Guard had died in the line of duty Sunday night. One of them, Cristal García Hurtado, was a regional police commander. Local press reported that she had been decapitated.","The attack occurred on the highway connecting the towns of Patzcuaro and Uruapan.

The Michoacan state prosecutor’s office, which is investigating, did not immediately comment.

Michoacan has been particularly hard hit by gang turf wars, with the Jalisco New Generation cartel fighting a local gang, the Viagras, for control. Thousands of residents have been displaced as organized crime experiments with drone attacks and improvised explosive devices.

In February, two hopefuls to be mayor of the town of Maravatío were killed within hours of each other.

The Afghan Taliban government released the water from the Kamal Khan Dam, built on the Helmand River, towards the Iranian territory, private Tolo News TV&#160;reported&#160;on 6 March.","Helmand is Afghanistan's major river and runs into Hamoun wetland in Iran's parched Sistan-Baluchestan Province, which shares international borders with Afghanistan's southwestern Nimruz province.&#160;

Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Taliban government, said that the government is committed to the Afghanistan-Iran water treaty, adding that they released the water to flow to Iran because the recent rains have filled the reservoir.

""We continuously try to ensure that reservoirs are full of water in Afghanistan. We have considered our commitments with Iran and fulfilled them; therefore, we released the water,"" Mujahid added.

Iranian officials have repeatedly called on the Taliban to give Iran its rightful share of water from Afghan water streams, but some commentators said that priority should be given to Afghan people's rights.

""The Afghan government has decided to make some water available to our neighbours, but it should be done after making political and economic calculations so that the Afghan people's rights are protected,"" said Fahim Faramarz, an economist.

However, farmers in Afghanistan's southwestern Nimruz province complained that they faced drought for years. Therefore, they should be given priority in irrigating their farmlands.

""Priority should be given to farmers in Nimruz province. We experienced drought for two years, which has caused huge financial loss,"" said Gul Ahmad, a farmer.

""First, we should receive sufficient water to irrigate our crops and farmlands. Once we get enough water, we will not mind giving some water to our neighbours,"" said Ahmad Khan, another farmer.

""Drought has affected us badly. We have lost our crops and weather,"" said Noor Ahmad, another farmer.

Afghanistan and Iran signed the Helmand [also known as Hirmand] River Water Treaty in 1973. Based on the agreement, Afghanistan will supply Iran with 26 cubic meters of water per second or 850 million cubic meters annually.

The missile is equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles, Modi said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.","India has been developing its medium- and long-range missile systems since the 1990s as its strategic competition with China grows.

In 2021, India successfully tested Agni-5, a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 5,000 kilometers (3,125 miles) that is believed to be capable of targeting nearly all of China. Agni missiles are long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.

India is also able to strike anywhere in neighboring Pakistan, its archrival with which it has fought three wars since they gained independence from British colonialists in 1947."
APRS000020240324ek3o00bkp, Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Amir says he is available for T20 World Cup selection ,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Amir says he is available for the upcoming T20 World Cup after having “positive discussions” with Pakistan Cricket Board officials.

The left-arm fast bowler played his last T20 international against England in August 2020 before he quit international cricket, saying he was mentally tortured.","“I still dream to play for Pakistan!” the 31-year-old Amir wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday.

“Life brings us to the points where at times we have to reconsider our decisions. There have been a few positive discussions between myself and the PCB where they respectfully made me feel that I was needed and can still play for Pakistan, and after discussing with family and well wishers I declare that I am available to be considered for upcoming T20 WC.

“I want do this for my country as it comes before my personal decisions. Donning the green jersey and serving my country has always been, and will continue to be, my greatest aspiration.”

Amir is the second Pakistan player who has come out of retirement and shown interest in returning to international cricket over the last two days.

On Saturday, all-rounder Imad Wasim said that he’s also available until the T20 World Cup after guiding Islamabad United to its third title in the Pakistan Super League earlier this week.

Amir also played in the PSL for Quetta Gladiators and took 10 wickets in 9 games with an economy rate of 8.41. Both cricketers have experience of playing T20 league cricket in the West Indies, which is a T20 World Cup co-host nation alongside the United States.

APRS000020240320ek3k00d49, An Amsterdam court has ruled KLM's sustainable aviation advertising misled consumers ,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — In a decision hailed by an environmental group as a historic victory, an Amsterdam court ruled Wednesday that Dutch national airline KLM misled consumers in statements about sustainable aviation in a case that accused the carrier of “greenwashing.”

Amsterdam District Court said in a statement that in some advertisements, that are no longer in use, KLM “makes environmental claims based on vague and general statements about environmental benefits, thereby misleading consumers.”","The court said that in other cases, “KLM paints an overly rosy picture of the effects of measures such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (made from renewable raw materials) and reforestation.” The court said such measures “only marginally reduce the negative environmental aspects and give the wrong impression that flying with KLM is sustainable.”

In a reaction posted on X, formerly Twitter, one of the groups that filed the case, Fossielvrij NL, called the ruling “a historic victory over greenwashing by big polluters.”

Greenwashing refers to claims that aim to deceive the public about how environmentally friendly a product, policy or organization is.

The groups claimed that KLM violated European consumer law by misleading customers with ads and a carbon offset program that “give a false impression over the sustainability of its flights and plans to address its climate harm.”

The court did not order KLM to rectify the advertisements, and “does not have to warn consumers that current aviation is not sustainable.” But it said that if the airline “informs consumers about its ambitions in the area of ​​CO2 reduction, for example, it must do so honestly and concretely.”

In a written reaction, KLM acknowledged: “Our communication about sustainability must be honest and transparent.”

“We are pleased that the court has ruled that we can continue to communicate with our customers and partners about our approach to making aviation more sustainable. We are continuously learning how best to include them in this,” it added.

APRS000020240315ek3f00i7l, Police search for suspect in fatal shooting of police officer in eastern New Mexico ,"TUCUMCARI, N.M. (AP) — Multiple law enforcement agencies searched Friday for the suspect in the fatal shooting of a state police officer killed on Interstate 40 in eastern New Mexico.

The victim was identified as New Mexico state police officer Justin Hare, 35, the governor's office said in a statement Friday afternoon.","The shooting occurred early Friday morning near mile marker 320, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Texas state line, the state Department of Public Safety said.

The suspect was last seen on foot wearing a brown hoodie and jacket on the I-40 Frontage Road between Montoya and Newkirk, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Tucumcari, state police said in a message posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“The suspect is armed and dangerous, do not approach, call 911 immediately,” police said.

KOAT-TV reported the officer was doing a welfare check on the interstate after spotting a vehicle pulled over onto the shoulder of the traffic lanes before the shooting occurred.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement: “It’s a tragic reminder of the dangers our law enforcement officers face each time they put on a uniform and report for duty.""

Cabinet Secretary Jason Bowie said it was a “sacrifice no one should have to make.”

""Officer Hare will never be forgotten, and his sacrifice safeguarding our state is worthy of the highest honors,"" he said."
APRS000020240315ek3f00fth, European charity ship rescues 135 migrants but is assigned to distant port in Italy with 359 aboard ,"ROME (AP) — The European charity ship Ocean Viking said Friday it rescued another 135 migrants, including a pregnant woman and eight children, from a double-decker boat in Maltese search-and-rescue waters.

In total, the vessel operated by the humanitarian group SOS Mediterranee was carrying 359 shipwreck survivors, it said, adding the ship had been assigned to the distant port at Ancona, in Italy's central Marche region.","“Such a long navigation should never be imposed on persons rescued at sea,” the rescue organization wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Non-governmental organizations operating in the central Mediterranean Sea have repeatedly warned that the far-right-led Italian government’s policy of assigning ports farther north keeps their rescue ships out of waters where they can be saving lives.

Migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, often flee war and poverty in their own countries in search of a better life in European nations via the Mediterranean Sea.

Rome has recently ordered the ships to port after each rescue, punishing groups that conduct other rescues by holding ships in port for 20 days at a time.

The Ocean Viking has been subject to three such blocks over three months, the most recently from Feb. 8 until a judge lifted the block 10 days later.

Friday's rescue came a day after survivors saved from a deflating rubber dinghy in the central Mediterranean on Thursday reported that some 60 people who departed from Libya with them more than a week ago had perished during the journey. 

The Ocean Viking spotted the dinghy with 25 people on board Wednesday. Two were unconscious and were evacuated to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, some 60 miles (97 kilometers) to the north. The other 23 were in serious condition, exhausted, dehydrated and with burns from fuel on board the boat.

An SOS Mediterranee spokesman said the survivors were traumatized and unable to give full accounts of what had transpired during the voyage, adding that the number of missing and presumed dead was unlikely to ever be verified.

Humanitarian groups often rely on accounts of survivors when pulling together the numbers of dead and missing at sea, presumed to have died.

The U.N. International Organization for Migration says 227 people have died along the perilous central Mediterranean route this year through March 11, not counting the new reported missing and presumed dead. That’s out of a total 279 deaths in the Mediterranean since Jan. 1. A total of 19,562 people arrived in Italy using that route in the period.

APRS000020240312ek3c00rp9, The top strategist of late Russian opposition leader Navalny is attacked in Lithuania's capital ,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Associates of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny said late Tuesday that the politician's close ally and top strategist was attacked near his home in Lithuania's capital.

Kira Yarmysh, who had been Navalny's spokesperson, said the assailant smashed a window of Leonid Volkov's car, sprayed tear gas into his eyes and started hitting him with a hammer. Volkov was later taken to a hospital, according to Navalny's ally Ivan Zhdanov.","The attack took place in Vilnius nearly a month after Navalny's unexplained death in a remote Arctic penal colony. President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic was serving a 19-year prison term there on the charges of extremism widely <a>seen as politically motivated</a>.

Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's best-known opposition politician, had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption and a network of regional offices were designated as “extremist organizations” by the Russian government that same year.

His death, reported by penitentiary officials on Feb. 16, sent shockwaves around the globe, with opposition figures and Western leaders laying the blame on the Kremlin — something officials in Moscow vehemently rejected.

The politician's funeral in Moscow on March 1 drew thousands of supporters, a rare show of defiance in Putin's Russia amid unabating and ruthless crackdown on dissent. Those willing to pay tribute to Navalny, 47, kept streaming to his grave in southeastern Moscow for days after the ceremony. Navalny's widow Yulia has vowed to continue her late husband's work.

Volkov used to be in charge of Navalny's regional offices and election campaigns — Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013 and sought to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election. Volkov left Russia several years ago under pressure from the authorities.

Last year, Volkov and his team launched a project called “Navalny’s Campaigning Machine,” with the goal of talking to as many Russians as possible, either by phone or online, and turning them against Putin ahead of the March 15-17 presidential election.

Not long before his death, Navalny has also urged supporters to flock to the polls at noon on Sunday, the final day of voting, to demonstrate their discontent with the Kremlin. His allies have been actively promoting the strategy, dubbed “Noon Against Putin,” in recent weeks.

Russian independent news outlet Meduza said it interviewed Volkov several hours before the attack and asked him about risks for Navalny's team. “The key risk is that we will all be killed,” Meduza quoted Volkov as saying.

Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on X, formerly Twitter, that the news about an attack on Volkov are “shocking” and stressed that the ""perpetrators will have to answer for their crime.”"
APRS000020240330ek3u0093u, UK counterterrorism police investigate an attack on an Iranian TV presenter outside his London home ,"LONDON (AP) — British counterterrorism police are investigating the stabbing of an Iranian television presenter outside his home in London as concern grows over threats to a Farsi-language satellite news channel long critical of Iran’s theocratic government.

Pouria Zeraati, a presenter at London-based Iran International, was stabbed in the leg Friday afternoon and is in stable condition at a hospital, the station said. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.","London’s Metropolitan Police Service said Zeraati’s occupation, together with recent threats to U.K.-based Iranian journalists, triggered the counterterrorism probe, even though the motivation for the attack is still unclear.

“While we continue to assess the circumstances of this incident, detectives are following a number of lines of inquiry and our priority at this time is to try and identify whoever was behind this attack and to arrest them,"" Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, said in a statement.

“I appreciate the wider concern this incident may cause — particularly amongst others in similar lines of work, and those from Iranian communities.""

Iran International spokesman Adam Baillie said the stabbing was “hugely frightening."" Although the channel’s journalists have been threatened in the past, this is the first attack of its kind, Baillie told the BBC.

“It was a shocking, shocking incident, whatever the outcome of an investigation reveals,"" he said.

Mehdi Hosseini Matin, Iran’s charge d’affaires in the UK, said “we deny any link” to the incident.

Police say they have disrupted “a number” of plots to kill or kidnap people in the U.K. who were seen as enemies of the Iranian government. Officers are working with intelligence agencies to disrupt future plots and provide protection for the targeted organizations and individuals, police said.

Early last year, Iran International temporarily shut down its operations in London and moved to studios in Washington, D.C., after what it described as an escalation of “state-backed threats from Iran.” The station resumed operations at a new location in London last September.

An Austrian man was convicted in December of attempting to collect information likely to be useful for terrorism after security guards spotted him carrying out surveillance on the former headquarters of Iran International. Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, 31, was sentenced to three years and six months in prison.

Alicia Kearns, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, expressed concern that Britain still isn’t doing enough to protect opponents of the Iranian government.

“Whilst we don’t know the circumstances of this attack, Iran continues to hunt down those brave enough to speak out against the regime,” Kearns said on X, formerly Twitter. “Yet I remain unconvinced that we and our allies have clear strategies to protect people in our countries from them, and protect our interests abroad.”

Earlier this month, Foreign Secretary David Cameron condemned the conviction in absentia of 10 journalists from the BBC’s Persian service on propaganda charges against the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling it “completely unacceptable.”

“And also, when I last met the Iranian foreign minister, I raised the case of the fact that Iran was paying thugs to try and murder Iranian journalists providing free and independent information for Iran TV in Britain,” Cameron said in the House of Lords. “On both counts, in my view, they are guilty.”"
APRS000020240316ek3g00fid, Brazil's Bolsonaro 'not afraid of any trial' over accusations he plotted to remain president ,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Saturday he was “not afraid of any trial,” a day after documents released by the Supreme Court revealed that two top military leaders said the populist plotted to remain in power after losing the 2022 election.

Bolsonaro avoided commenting on the content of any of several investigations targeting him, but claimed he was a victim of “persecution” for causing trouble for the country's political left. Authorities in February confiscated Bolsonaro's passport.","“I could very well be in another country, but I decided to come back here at all costs. I’m not afraid of any trial, as long as the judges are impartial,” Bolsonaro said in Rio de Janeiro, speaking at a campaign event in the city's mayoral race.

The court documents released Saturday included testimony from Bolsonaro’s former Army and Air Force commanders to police, who said they refused the former leader's demands and would arrest him if he tried to stay in power.

The testimonies include the first direct mentions of the right-wing leader as actively participating in a conspiracy to ignore the results of the October 2022 election won by his rival, current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

At the same time the new information was revealed, Bolsonaro appeared to be traveling to different cities in Rio de Janeiro state, posting videos to X, formerly Twitter. The embattled politician was featured surrounded by throngs of supporters cheering and wearing Brazil's yellow soccer jersey, which has turned into an emblem of his feverish right-wing movement.

The statements only added to a growing pile of legal woes for Bolsonaro as prosecutors seek to find links between the far-right leader and the Jan. 8, 2023 riots that trashed government buildings in the capital Brasilia one week after Lula’s inauguration.

The right-wing populist has denied allegations that he and his supporters attempted a coup during the 2023 attacks."
APRS000020240306ek3600mop, Navalny's widow calls for Russia election day gatherings on March 17 to show dismay with Putin ,"The widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison three weeks ago, called on his supporters on Wednesday to join a protest of this month's presidential election that Navalny devised shortly before his still-unexplained death.

Yulia Navalnaya asked Russians opposed to President Vladimir Putin to get in line at voting stations on March 17, the last and main day of voting.","Putin is certain to win a fifth term in office, potentially extending his rule to 2030, in the election that includes only token opponents.

Navalnaya acknowledged that in a video message on X, formerly Twitter, saying “Putin will imagine any result that he likes, even 80, even 180%.”

But the gathering “will help millions of people see like-minded people and realize that we are not alone, we are surrounded by people who are also against war, against corruption and against lawlessness,” she said.

“We need to use election day to show that we exist and there are many of us, we are actual, living, real people and we are against Putin. ... What to do next is up to you. You can vote for any candidate except Putin. You could ruin your ballot,” Navalnaya said.

Navalny had floated the noontime concept on Feb. 1, saying it was a “completely legal and safe” way to protest and that authorities would have no way of countering it. Mass protest actions in Russia have become effectively impossible under Putin's intensifying crackdown on dissent and criticism in recent years.

Navalny was reported dead on Feb. 16. Authorities said that he became ill after a walk at his prison colony, but have otherwise given no details. Navalny had been imprisoned since returning to Moscow in early 2021 from Germany, where he had been recuperating from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin."
APRS000020240331ek3v0073l, Babar Azam appointed as Pakistan white-ball captain ,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan has appointed Babar Azam as its white-ball captain and ended Shaheen Shah Afridi’s one-series stint as Twenty20 skipper.

“Following unanimous recommendation from the PCB’s selection committee, Chairman PCB Mohsin Naqvi has appointed Babar Azam as white-ball (ODI and T20I) captain of the Pakistan men’s cricket team,” the Pakistan Cricket Board said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday.","Babar stepped down from the all-format captaincy last year after Pakistan couldn’t make it to the semifinals of the 50-over World Cup in India. But under Afridi’s leadership Pakistan lost the T20 series in New Zealand 4-1.

The new chairman of the PCB Mohsin Naqvi also didn’t especially warm to Afridi, especially after the left-arm fast bowler had a disastrous Pakistan Super League where his franchise – Lahore Qalandars – won just one out of 10 league games under his captaincy and finished last in the tournament.

Pakistan’s next international assignment is a five-match T20 series against New Zealand at home, starting April 18. Pakistan is also due to play three T20s against Ireland and four against England before the T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies from June 2.

APRS000020240307ek3700kg5, Turkey and Somalia strike an oil and gas cooperation deal for the Horn of Africa nation ,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey and Somalia reached an oil and gas cooperation agreement for the Horn of Africa nation in Istanbul on Thursday, the Turkish energy minister said, the latest step in strengthening ties between the two countries.

The agreement comes against the backdrop of Somalia’s dispute with Ethiopia over the breakaway region of Somaliland. Somalia announced last month that it also reached a defense deal with Turkey that includes support for Somalia’s sea assets.","Turkey says Thursday’s deal includes the exploration, exploitation, development and production of oil on ""Somalia’s onshore and offshore blocks.”

""We aim to strengthen Turkey’s presence in the Horn of Africa with these collaborations in the energy field,” Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said on X, formerly Twitter.

Somalia’s petroleum and mineral resources ministers, Abdirizak Omar Mohamed, was in Istanbul for the deal.

Turkey is a key player in Somalia, one of several states jockeying for influence in a country on the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden — a pathway to the Red Sea.

Under the Feb. 8 defense deal, Turkey is to provide training and equipment to the Somali navy so it can better safeguard its territorial waters from threats such as terrorism, piracy, and “foreign interference.”

The defense deal, which according to Somali authorities will be in force for a decade, is aimed at deterring Ethiopia’s efforts to secure access to the sea by way of the breakaway Somaliland.

Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding with Somaliland on Jan. 1. The document has not been made public, but Somaliland says Ethiopia agreed to recognize its independence in return for a naval port. The document has rattled Somalia, which said it’s prepared to go to war over it because it considers Somaliland part of its territory."
APRS000020240306ek3600ox9," France seeks personal accounts of liberation from the Nazis, 80 years after the D-Day landings ","PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday called on the public to collect photos, films, personal journals and testimony from witnesses to liberation at the end of World War Two, as the country prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings which heralded the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.

“Let’s share and inscribe our families’ memories in our nation’s history,” Macron said in a video message posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Let’s honor our liberators and let the young generation carry our memories into the future.”","In June, France plans to show its gratitude towards World War II veterans with a ceremony at Omaha Beach to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when 160,000 troops from the U.S., Britain, Canada and other nations landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944.

Many veterans are expected to return to Normandy beaches, some after a long trans-Atlantic journey, despite advanced age, fatigue and physical difficulties.

Macron specifically called on schoolchildren and teachers around the country to help research heroes from Africa, the Pacific, and elsewhere in the world, who helped liberate France. He emphasized the importance of linking the last witnesses of the war and those who sacrificed for freedom and liberty, enjoyed by the today’s youth.

“These young women and young men, like young people today, had their dreams and their plans for the future,” Macron said. “They had the courage to fight for freedom, against the Nazi barbarity, and often paid the price with their lives.”

A ceremony at Omaha Beach, with many heads of state expected to be present, will honor the contribution of the Allied troops. Over the coming months, France will also pay tribute to Resistance fighters from France and abroad, to soldiers recruited in its colonies in Africa, and to the civilians who suffered during the war.

In the past couple of years, commemorations in Normandy also have taken on extra significance as war returned to Europe with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022."

The attack took place around 7 p.m. local time Saturday in the southern neighborhood of Guasmo.

The gunmen got out of the vehicle and proceeded to shoot people.","“So far, the result is nine people dead and 10 injured,” police Col. Ramiro Arequipa told journalists around midday on Sunday.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

It was the second mass killing in as many days. On Friday, five people who had been kidnapped were killed execution style in the coastal province of Manabi by an armed gang. Police said there were signs the victims were tourists mistakenly caught up in a local drug-trafficking dispute. They didn't elaborate.

In that incident, an armed group had kidnapped a total of 11 people. Police said the other six, including five minors, were rescued and handed over to their families. Two suspects were arrested on Saturday morning, according to police.

The killings in Manabi “remind us that the battle continues,” said Ecuador’s President Daniel Noboa on the social media network X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday.

“Narcoterrorism and its allies are looking for spaces to scare us, but they will not succeed,” Noboa said. His post contained a video of a man handcuffed and bent over, being led away forcefully by an armed police officer.

Ecuador was once considered a bastion of peace in Latin America, but in recent years has seen a surge in violent attacks.

Noboa declared a state of emergency in January, which provides for permanent operations by a security force made up of police and military. In addition, a five-hour curfew is in force in high-incidence areas such as Guayaquil.

On March 24, the 27-year-old mayor of a small town — also in the province of Manabi — was killed along with her collaborator. Brigitte Garcia and Jairo Loor were found inside a vehicle with gunshot wounds.

On Thursday, a riot in a Guayaquil prison under military and police control left three inmates dead and four injured.

Ecuador surpassed a rate of 40 violent deaths per 100,000 inhabitants at the end of 2023, one of the highest in the region, according to police."

BBCMAP0020240305ek3500001,Argentina opposition slam Milei's decision to close official news agency Telam,"By BBC Monitoring

Several Argentine legislators, political leaders, former officials, trade unions and human rights organisations expressed on 4 March their solidarity with the workers of Telam, following Argentine President Javier Milei's announcement of the closure of the state-owned Argentine news agency at the opening of legislative sessions on 1 March, Argentine newspaper Pagina 12 reported on its website on 5 March.","Pagina 12, a left-wing opposition daily that is highly critical of right-winger Milei and his administration, titled its article ""Strong rejection of the closure of Telam"".

""Rejection against the closure announcement and 'the attempt to curtail the right to information of the entire population' had its main expression this Monday [4 March] at noon at the doors of Telam,"" the newspaper said, referring to a demonstration by the news agency's workers and the Buenos Aires Press Union (Sipreba).

Several Argentine media reported on 4 March that access to Telam offices had been barred, the news agency's website was taken down and Telam employees had been suspended from work for a week.

Argentine media reported that Milei had justified his decision to close Telam by saying that it had been used during ""the past decades"" as a ""Kirchnerist propaganda [news] agency"".

""Kirchnerism"" refers to the left-wing husband and wife dynasty of former presidents Nestor and Cristina Kirchner who had governed Argentina from 2003 to 2015. Cristina Kirchner, who succeeded her late husband Nestor in office in 2007, also served as vice-president to former President Alberto Fernandez from 2019 to 2023.

Pagina 12 said that one of the first to criticise the closure of Telam was German Martinez, head of the leftist opposition Union for the Homeland bloc in the Chamber of Deputies.

""Ruthless anti-democrats. In a clear act of censorship, Milei's government closed down the Telam agency, suspended its website and prevented workers from going to work,"" Martinez said on X (formerly Twitter) as quoted by the report.

""It is a totally authoritarian measure that hurts our democracy,"" Martinez added, according to Telam.

According to the report, for her part, Workers' Left Front legislator Myriam Bregman announced on social media that she had presented a bill to the lower house of Congress ""in defence of Telam"", in order to ""reject any attempt to advance in the scrapping and emptying of the [news] agency"" as well as to ""denounce that behind the closure hides a new attack on the right to communication, information and freedom of expression"".

According to Pagina 12, the Association of Foreign Correspondents of the Argentine Republic (ACERA) had also rejected the closure of Telam, highlighting ""the need for the country to have a state - and non-governmental - news agency that guarantees citizens access to plural information and that supports the dissemination of news that, for obvious reasons, is not usually of interest to commercial press media, but which is vital for public opinion"".

In a 4 March article recounting the history of Telam, Pagina 12 noted that the news agency was created on 15 April 1945 by Juan Domingo Peron who was then secretary of Labour and Welfare. He later served several terms as president and founded the dominant leftist political movement in Argentina known as ""Peronism"".

NYTFEED020240317ek3h00335,Niger Orders American Troops to Leave Its Territory,"The West African country’s military junta said the presence of U.S. forces was “illegal.” Increasingly, West Africans are questioning the motives of Western countries operating in Africa.

Niger said it is revoking its military cooperation deal with the United States, ordering 1,000 American armed forces personnel to leave the country and throwing the United States’ strategy in the region into disarray.","The announcement by the West African nation’s military junta on Saturday came after meetings last week with a delegation from Washington and the top U.S. commander for Africa, Gen. Michael E. Langley. The move is in keeping with a recent pattern by countries in the Sahel region, an arid area south of the Sahara, of breaking ties with Western countries. Increasingly, they are partnering with Russia instead.

American officials also voiced alarm in the meetings about several other issues, including whether Niger’s military government was nearing a deal to give Iran access to Niger’s vast uranium reserves, a concern that was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

Niger’s rejection of military ties with the United States follows the withdrawal from Niger of troops from France, the former colonial power that, for the past decade, has led foreign counterterrorism efforts against jihadist groups in West Africa, but which has lately been perceived as a pariah in the region.

“The American presence in the territory of the Republic of Niger is illegal,” Niger’s military spokesman, Col. Amadou Abdramane, said on national television. He added that the U.S. military presence “violates all the constitutional and democratic rules, which would require the sovereign people — notably through its elected officials — to be consulted on the installation of a foreign army on its territory.”

Matthew Miller, the chief State Department spokesman, said it was in touch with the ruling military junta, known as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland, or CNSP, about the move.

“We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP’s trajectory,” he said in a message on X, formerly Twitter.

Many of the Americans posted to Niger are stationed at U.S. Air Base 201, a six-year-old, $110 million installation in the country’s desert north. But since the military coup that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum and installed the junta last July, the troops there have been inactive, with most of their drones grounded.

Because of the coup, the United States had to suspend security operations and development aid to Niger.

Mr. Bazoum, the country’s elected president, is still under arrest, eight months after he was ousted. But the United States had wanted to maintain its partnership with the country.

A senior U.S. military official said on Sunday there had been no immediate changes to the status of about 1,000 American military personnel stationed in the country. The Pentagon has continued to conduct surveillance drone flights from Air Base 201 to protect U.S. troops and alert the Nigerien authorities if the flights detected an imminent terrorist threat.

“The canceling of the security agreement is not quite a direct expulsion of the American military presence, as happened with the French,” said Hannah Rae Armstrong, an analyst focused on peace and security in the Sahel. “It’s more likely an aggressive negotiation tactic to extract more benefits from cooperating with the Americans.”

In Niger, the decision was couched in terms of “sovereignty” — rhetoric meant to resonate with the public.

“The goal of American policy is not to help fight armed groups, but to maintain control and counter the growing influence in the region of countries such as Russia, China and Turkey,” Abdoulaye Sissoko, a Nigerien columnist, wrote on a popular Nigerien news site. “There is no public evidence that American bases in Niger have proven useful.”

American officials say they have tried for months to prevent a formal break in relations with Niger’s junta.

The new U.S. ambassador to Niger, Kathleen FitzGibbon, one of Washington’s top Africa specialists, has held regular discussions with the junta since taking office at the beginning of the year.

In a trip to Niger in December, Molly Phee, an assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, said the United States intended to resume security and development cooperation with Niger, even as she called for a swift transition to civilian rule and the release of Mr. Bazoum.

But the Pentagon has been planning for the worst-case contingencies if the talks failed. The Defense Department has been discussing establishing new drone bases with several coastal West African countries as backups to the base in Niger, which is landlocked. Talks are still in the early stages, military officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.

J. Peter Pham, a former special U.S. envoy to the Sahel, said Washington will “have to wait and see” how Niger will implement the new approach.

“The potential fallout goes beyond the not insignificant damage to counterterrorism and intelligence efforts that loss of access to the bases in Niger entail,” Mr. Pham said, “but to the broader damage to America’s standing on the continent.”

The Biden administration formally acknowledged last October what most countries had declared months previously: that the military takeover in Niger last July was a coup.

Biden administration officials had sidestepped that declaration for weeks because the word “coup” has major policy implications. Congress has mandated that the United States must halt all economic and military aid to any government installed by a military coup until democracy is restored.

But the administration finally concluded that efforts to restore Niger’s democratically elected government to power had failed and that aid that had not already been restricted would be cut off. State Department officials said nearly $200 million in aid that was temporarily paused in August would be suspended. About $442 million in trade and agricultural assistance will also be suspended.

In Washington, the Biden administration had been holding out increasingly dim hopes that the military junta would reverse its takeover and agree to restore a democratically elected government.

The junta’s announcement is part of a major change in dynamic between the country and its erstwhile Western partners.

“It reflects a real shift in the balance of power,” Ms. Armstrong said. “Over the past decade, Niger has repeatedly pleaded for security assistance and aid. Now it’s the U.S. that finds itself in a position of being asked to beg to keep forces and bases in the country.”

The entire military approach in the Sahel needs to be reformed, said El Hadj Djitteye, director of the Timbuktu Center for Strategic Studies on the Sahel, a Mali-based think tank.

“Western governments including the United States and France have failed to work closely with African governments and civilian populations in economic and military development,” Mr. Djitteye said. This, he said, has fed the widely held perception that their presence in the region is an extension of “the old colonial pattern which puts colonial interests first and African interests a distant second.”"
APRS000020240316ek3g00ga5, England captain Harry Kane could miss Brazil and Belgium games after injuring ankle in Bundesliga ,"DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) — England captain Harry Kane is a doubt for upcoming international friendlies against Brazil and Belgium after sustaining an ankle injury while playing for Bayern Munich on Saturday.

“He twisted his ankle in the goal net. He’s cooled it with ice. We don’t have a (final) diagnosis yet. We have to wait and see and hope that it remains a scare,” Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said after the team’s 5-2 win over Darmstadt in the Bundesliga.","Kane crashed into the post late in the game as he tried to reach the ball when it rebounded off the crossbar from Jamal Musiala’s effort. He appeared to be in pain and received brief treatment on the field before going off.

Earlier, Kane had scored his 31st league goal to set the record for goals in a debut Bundesliga season. He also eclipsed his previous best mark of 30 league goals in a season achieved with Tottenham in the Premier League in 2018 and again last season.

“Proud to break a Bundesliga record but more importantly another good win,” Kane wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund said the club was in “close contact” with England and that Kane “will not take any risks” when the Three Lions face Brazil at Wembley Stadium on March 23 and Belgium at the same venue three days later.

BBCAP00020240313ek3d000m9,Chad website reports dissolution of opposition party,"By BBC Monitoring

Independent news website Tchad One reported on 13 March that the Chadian government has dissolved the Socialist Party Without Borders (PSF).&#160;","""Two weeks to the day after the assassination of Yaya Dillo, president of the PSF, the arrest of its activists and the demolition of its headquarters, Mahamat Kaka [President Gen Mahamat Idriss Deby] orders the dissolution of the PSF,"" Tchad One said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).&#160;

It added that the Minister of State and Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation, Limane Mahamat, carried out the task of suspending the party&#8217;s activities and requesting the head of the Supreme Court Samir Anour to carry out the dissolution of the party.&#160;

The post contained a bilingual Arabic-French document dated 29 February and signed by Mahamat ordering the court to dissolve the party.&#160;

Tchad One called it the ""repression of a political party"" and a ""first"" in 34 years of ""pseudo-democracy"" stressing that it happened two days after President Deby asked for forgiveness for his mistakes.&#160;

The post further implied that the recent&#160;visit by French President Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s envoy Jean Marie Bockel to Chad prompted the move as he expressed France&#8217;s support and ""admiration"" for President Deby.&#160;

Tchad One said that alleged attempts by the government to ""erase Dillo from the presidential landscape"" would fail as he remained ""in the hearts of all Chadians deprived of justice and change"".&#160;

On 29 February, opposition leader Dillo was killed by security forces after being accused - alongside his party - of plotting to murder the head of the country's Supreme Court. He was a cousin of President Deby.&#160;

Subsequently, Chadian authorities demolished the party&#8217;s headquarters on 1 March. &#160;

Chadian pro-opposition news website TchadOne reported on X (formerly Twitter) on 18 March that junta chief Gen Mahamat Idriss Deby&#8217;s ongoing trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is largely in response to recent setbacks suffered by the Sudan&#8217;s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in fighting in the Khartoum area and elsewhere in Sudan.","The UAE is widely seen as the RSF&#8217;s patron and according to the website the &#8220;high risk&#8221; trip by Mahamat was prompted by the UAE, which intends to finalise preparations for Chadian military support for the RSF, to reverse recent defeats suffered in the Sudanese war.

&#8220;This high-risk move for Kaka [Mahamat Deby], who has not left Chad for months, comes at a time when Gen [Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as] Hemedti is experiencing difficulties in Sudan. After the fall of Omdurman three days ago [15 March], the Sudanese army is tightening its grip on Khartoum, where thousands of men from the RSF, supported by arms and fuel from the Emirates via the Chadian junta, are trapped,&#8221; the website said.

&#8220;According to two corroborating sources confirmed by TchadOne, the Emirates are going to ask the Chadian regime's army to intervene directly on the Sudanese front to rescue Hemedti. The plan is to deploy a force of several thousand men armed and financed by the Emiratis, with the aim of storming Khartoum and then Port Sudan.&#8221; &#160;&#160;

It added that France through a presidential envoy tried to dissuade Mahamat from proceeding with the plan, but key political allies such as Mahamat&#8217;s chief of staff, Idriss Youssouf Boy are strong advocates, TchadOne claimed.

Sudan has repeatedly accused the Chadian junta of channelling UAE military aid to the RSF, an allegation N&#8217;Djamena denies.

Chad is hosting more than 500,000 Sudanese refugees and is a key entry point for aid entering Sudan's besieged Darfur region.

The Uyghur militant group, Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), has issued a statement announcing two senior appointments in its Syria branch, and calling for unity.","The announcement comes amid significant unrest in north-west Syria, where TIP is based, that is threatening the standing of Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), of which TIP is a longstanding ally.

See: Analysis: Protests shake HTS's grip on Syria rebel bastion

While the TIP statement did not refer to the anti-HTS protests in rebel-held Idlib, the bastion of HTS, it did hint at difficult circumstances facing TIP, as it called for ""cohesion"" and ""unity"".&#160;

The one-page statement in Arabic was dated 24 March 2024 and signed by TIP's top leader, ""Abd al-Haqq"". It was shared the following day on Telegram by a number of Syria-focused Islamist and pro-opposition accounts, including by former HTS member Abu Yahya al-Farghali.

Appointments

The statement announced the appointment of two deputies to TIP-Syria leader, Abu Omar Kawthar.&#160;

They were named as Abu Muhammad (aka Zahid Qari), identified as TIP-Syria's military commander, and someone named only as Sheikh Touba, whose honorary title of ""Sheikh"" suggests seniority or scholarly credentials.

Both individuals appear to be relatively unknown, with little apparent online presence in jihadist social media circles.

The statement said the decision to make these appointments came after consultations between the Shura councils of central TIP and its Syrian branch.

It also stressed the importance of communication between the central TIP leadership and its Syria chapter.

&#8220;We ask of the brothers to obey what is correct, and advise all officials in the Syrian branch to make sure to communicate with their central leadership and interact it with it righteously.&#8221;

Message on unity

The message carried an implicit warning against fragmentation, hinting at difficult times for TIP followers.

Addressing its members in Syria, the leadership told them: &#8220;At a time when Islam has become alienated, and especially the Muslims of Turkistan, who are subject to terrible persecution, we ask of you to preserve the unity of the group and strengthen cooperation between yourselves and be at peace with one another.&#8221;

It also urged them to obey TIP leadership, whilst also encouraging them to offer advice and suggestions.&#160;

Overall, the statement was vague on why the appointments were made, if they replaced existing officials or were new, and if TIP has been affected by the protests dogging its ally, HTS.&#160;

The TIP has been active in northern Syria since the early days of the Syrian conflict. It has been fighting alongside HTS, under the latter's joint operations room al-Fatah al-Mubin, while officially remaining autonomous and often trying to avoid infighting and inter-rebel friction.&#160;

The group frequently criticises China for occupying the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, which it calls &#8220;East Turkistan,&#8221; and for the alleged persecution of Uyghur Muslims.&#160;

In December last year, TIP set up social media accounts, but the group's media operation and outlets nevertheless continue to suffer from instability.

Iranians online criticise 'merciful dealing' call for cleric in land-grabbing scandal

Anti-establishment Iranians online have criticised a call by the conservative Hamshahri newspaper to ""treat with religious mercy"" the case of senior cleric Hojjat ol-Eslam Kazem Seddiqi who has recently been at the centre of an illegal land seizure scandal.

See:&#160;Briefing: Allegations of land grabbing by senior cleric stir controversy in&#160;Iran

Users wondered why the ""merciful approach"" was not exercised in regard with ordinary citizens and critics of the establishment.

""Religious mercy-based dealing for insiders, decisive dealing with outsiders,"" one user said sarcastically in a post on X (formerly Twitter).

Some asked why protesters were executed for petty crimes such as ""setting fire to dustbins"" during the 2022 nationwide protests rather than being granted such ""merciful treatment"". Charges against Mohsen Shekari, who was the first protester executed in relation to the 2022 unrest, included blocking a street and setting fire to a dustbin alongside wounding a security force officer.

They circulated photos of the protesters executed or killed, as well as other cases of police crackdown and political prisoners, under the hashtag ""merciful dealing"".

The High Court of Maldives on 19 March annulled a previous ruling ordering Public Service Media (PSM) to pay 78m rufiyaa ($5.1m) to the Business Image Group (BIG) company and for the case to be reviewed again.

The high court, in its ruling, said while the ruling was issued against MNBC, given that MNBC's assets and debt have now been transferred to the PSM, and given that the interests of PSM are now involved in the case, PSM should be a party to case proceedings. With the Civil Court ruling PSM had paid 30m rufiyaa ($1.9m) of the 70m rufiyaa to BIG. The case was appealed at the high court in 2021, after the appeal period expired.

""According to sources [unnamed], the negotiations on the release of the ship and crew between the owners of the hijacked ship and the Somali Pirates have been going on since Wednesday [20 March] through a third party,"" English-language newspaper Daily Observer reported.

Sources related to the maritime trade have expressed hope that ""the hijack drama will end very soon"", the news report said.

However, Kabir Steel Re-Rolling Mills (KSRM) Group, the owners of MV Abdullah, have ""refuted"" reports on negotiations with the pirates, the report noted.

""We have been continuing contact with the sailors and the pirates,"" KSRM Group media spokesperson, Mijanul Islam, was quoted as saying.

""Our sailors were safe and in good health,"" he added.

In a related development, the European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) ""has deployed a warship under its anti-piracy mission Operation Atalanta near the hijacked Bangladeshi-flagged vessel"", according to a report by prominent English-language news website bdnews24.com.

A video posted on EUNAVFOR's official X (formerly Twitter) handle shows its warship ""positioned close to MV Abdullah"" and a helicopter ""hovering around the hijacked cargo ship"", the news report noted.

Earlier, EUNAVFOR had proposed to launch an operation to rescue the hijacked ship but the Bangladesh side ""did not agree"", according to a report by popular Bengali newspaper Prothom Alo.

KSRM Group spokesperson Islam told the newspaper that their ""first priority"" is to safely bring back the sailors.

President of the Bangladesh Merchant Marine Officers' Association, Captain Anam Chowdhury, said that so far, the government and owners of the ship have ""not given their consent for launching a military operation"" to rescue the ship, the news report noted.

Chowdhury said that in the current situation, there is ""no alternative but to find a peaceful solution"" to free the hostage ship, the report added.

The developments received widespread and largely factual coverage in frontline Bengali and English-language newspapers and online news outlets.

News report says US, Canada likely to take in over 600 Rohingyas

TEHRAN TIMES","Iran, E3 to hold nuclear talks in Geneva today

Iran and the three European signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) - France, Germany and the UK (collectively, the E3) - will hold a meeting today in Geneva on the deputy foreign ministerial level.

The meeting comes amid warnings by the E3 that they will activate the so-called snapback mechanism of the JCPOA to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran if Tehran fails to show progress in nuclear talks with the US.

US-Iran nuclear talks have been stalled since the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June. Talk about the snapback mechanism has intensified ahead of the October deadline when the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, passed in 2015 to endorse the JCPOA, expires.

The state radio channel (VIRI) said that Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi will lead the Iranian delegation today. VIRI noted the 22 August phone call between Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and his E3 counterparts, in which Araqchi rejected the E3's ""legal and moral authority"" to activate the snapback.

China and Russia, other signatories of the JCPOA, oppose the activation of the mechanism. President Massoud Pezeshkian also spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin yesterday, assuring him that Iran has never sought to build nuclear weapons.

Iran rejects Trump's post on Tehran's nuclear programme

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmail Baqai yesterday criticised Trump for reposting an old interview by a former Iranian MP, accusing the US president of distorting facts to justify US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Baqai said Trump was ignoring his own intelligence chief's assessments, referring to Tulsi Gabbard's testimony in March that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, and instead relying on personal remarks by a former Iranian lawmaker.

Baqai's remarks came in response to Trump sharing a clip without a comment, originally posted by influencer Mario Nawfal, of Ali Motahhari, former deputy parliament speaker, saying in 2022 that Iran had initially aimed to develop a nuclear weapon but failed to complete the project or conduct a test.

Motahhari, who left the parliament in 2020, dismissed Trump's post, saying that he was not an official at the time of the interview and adding that the US president ""seemed to lack evidence and so resorts to the personal comment of an ordinary individual"".

Foreign minister in Saudi Arabia for Gaza ministerial

Foreign Minister Araqchi yesterday addressed an emergency meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) about the Israel-Gaza war, urging Muslim countries to take concrete steps to halt ""genocide"" in Gaza.

On the sidelines of the Jeddah ministerial, Araqchi met his Egyptian, Saudi, Iraqi, Pakistani, Turkish and Algerian counterparts as well.

Separately, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Baqai yesterday condemned a deadly Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.

Parliament speaker backs president after leader's endorsement

Conservative Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf this morning called on hardline factions to stop talking about President Massoud Pezeshkian's alleged ""incompetence"", saying that they were ""playing into the enemy's hands"".

Qalibaf's remarks come after Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly backed the ""hardworking"" president on 24 August amid mounting criticism from hardliners against him and his reformist backers.

Some reformist newspapers complained that the attacks against Pezeshkian continued even after Khamenei's backing, accusing the hardliners of trying to ""destroy the government"".

Pro-reform daily Sazandegi named Saeed Jalili, Pezeshkian's hardline opponent in the 2024 election, Peyman Jebeli, the head of the state broadcaster, and several hardline MPs as members of the ""distortion movement"".

At the same time, Qalibaf in his speech rebuked a recent controversial statement by the major reformist group, Reform Front, while Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei yesterday strongly condemned it.

While reformist daily Hammihan criticised the judiciary's ""political statement"", ultraconservative daily Keyhan welcomed Ejei's remarks, warning that ""failing to deal with its statement-writing servants will give the enemy a foothold"".

The leader of the Reform Front, Azar Mansouri, yesterday defended the group's statement calling for direct talks with the US and suspending uranium enrichment, saying that the proposal was rooted in national responsibility.

Outcry after comedian mocks Persian epic poet Ferdowsi

Comedian Zeynab Mousavi has faced a wave of criticism after posting a video parodying verses from Ferdowsi's epic poem, the Shahnameh, with coarse and sexually explicit language.

The clip, widely shared on X and Instagram, was condemned across the political spectrum as an affront to a cornerstone of Persian literature and culture. Many users described it as an ""insult"", saying the Shahnameh is a national symbol that should not be subjected to crude mockery.

Mousavi's Instagram account was taken offline amid the uproar, though it is unclear whether she removed it herself or whether it was deactivated following user complaints.

This morning, Iran's judiciary announced that a case had been opened in Tehran's prosecutor's office for the controversial comedian, after pro-establishment media outlets also weighed in yesterday to report the story and criticise Mousavi.

The controversy has reignited debate online under various hashtags such as #Ferdowsi and #Shahnameh.

Some users argued that comedians should be free to joke about any subject, while others accused Mousavi's defenders of hypocrisy for supporting satire of Ferdowsi while opposing jokes on other topics."

Guatemala's Navy carried out three separate interceptions in recent days of vessels transporting cocaine in Pacific waters, confiscating a total of 2.3 tonnes of the drug and capturing 11 individuals, the official Guatemalan government newspaper Diario de Centro America said in a report posted on X on 13 March.","The most recent interception took place on 11 March, in international waters 400 nautical miles from the coasts of Guatemala's Escuintla department, and the navy apprehended three suspected Mexican nationals in the seized vessel, which sank, the report said.

It quoted Carlos Mota, chief of Guatemala's Pacific Naval Command, as hailing this operation as a ""milestone for the [Guatemalan] maritime forces, as it is the first time that a [drugs-carrying] launch has been found and intercepted at this distance in open sea, in international waters"".

Earlier on 11 March, another cocaine-carrying vessel had been intercepted 145 nautical miles from the Guatemalan Pacific coast, with three people on board whose nationalities were not given.

On 9 March, 245 nautical miles from the coast, another launch with cocaine on board was seized and three Mexicans and two Ecuadoreans were detained, Diario de Centro America reported. The official daily described these seizures by the Guatemalan navy as ""historic"".

The report cited Carlos Antonio Medina, chief of Guatemala's National Defence Staff, as saying that the maritime anti-drugs operations had involved the ""support of intelligence agencies of allied nations such as Colombia, Mexico and United States, as well as air assistance and use of radars to locate these launches"".

On 28 February, the official Guatemalan daily added, authorities had made the Central American nation's ""biggest seizure on land of drugs"", confiscating over 1.7 tonnes of cocaine found in a truck in Coatepeque, in the Quetzaltenango department.

The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) has claimed it conducted a drone attack on a chemical materials station in Israel's Haifa Port.","The announcement came in a statement the group posted on Telegram on 3 March, and it was followed by a video showing the launch of several drones.

&#8220;In continuation of our approach to resisting the occupation, in support of our people in Gaza, and in response to the massacres committed by the [Israeli] usurping entity against Palestinian civilians, including children, women and the elderly, the mujahideen of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a drone attack on the chemical materials station in Haifa Port in our occupied territories on the evening of Friday, 1 March 2024,&#8221; the statement said.

The statement added that the IRI &#8220;confirms that it will continue to destroy enemy strongholds&#8221;.

Later in the day, the group released a video purportedly showing the launch of drones used in the attack. A label displayed in the video suggested the operation took place on 1 March.

A reporter for the Israeli Walla news site posted IRI's claim on X (formerly Twitter) alongside text saying: ""There was no such attack.""

IRI has claimed dozens of attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria, as well as&#160;attacks on Israel, since the outbreak of the Gaza-Israel war in October.

IRI is an umbrella group comprising pro-Iran militias active in Iraq and Syria that seemed to have intensified their anti-US activities following the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The international talks between Iran and world powers to revive the&#160;2015 nuclear deal - Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)&#160;- have been stalled since September 2022.

Russia&#160;has&#160;regularly used Iranian-made drones&#160;in its war against Ukraine. Tehran has confirmed that it supplied&#160;a ""limited number"" of&#160;drones&#160;to&#160;Russia&#160;""months before"" the war but denies they are being used against&#160;Ukraine.

Armenia rules out any 'corridor' compromising its sovereignty","Yerevan has once again ruled out any transport arrangement that would compromise Armenia's territorial integrity or sovereignty.

""Armenia has never discussed and will not discuss the kinds of options of transport links that would be incompatible with its own territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction,"" Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's spokesperson Nazeli Baghdasaryan said on Facebook. She made the comments in response to what she described as ""confusion"" in the media about the matter.

""It is evident that there is some confusion in the Armenian media about Armenia's position regarding the unblocking of regional transport links, and the media outlets see some contradictions in the statements of Armenian officials. To some extent, this is understandable, because the topic has numerous nuances, which sometimes get more complicated with the use of certain wordings, such as renting out, lease, building lease, outsourcing. Certainly, each of the wordings can have different meanings depending on what specifically it pertains to.

""In order to make the issue easier for the esteemed representatives of the press, I would like to once again underscore that the Republic of Armenia has never discussed, is not discussing and will not discuss the kinds of options of transport links passing through its own territory that would be incompatible with the territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Republic of Armenia.

""And furthermore, as part of its territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction, the Republic of Armenia is not only discussing various formulas of utilising regional transport routes, but is also eager to reach an agreement around any of the formulas,"" Baghdasaryan said.

""Armenia's territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction cannot be outsourced. The business management of a railway, pipeline [or] power transmission lines can be [outsourced]. Incidentally, the maintenance and management of roads in Armenia has always been outsourced to private companies. Who manages [the roads] and with what quality is another matter. But this has nothing to do with the topic discussed,"" Baghdasaryan added.

Armenia to temporarily shelter 'endangered' Palestinian cultural heritage

Armenia will temporarily house elements of ""endangered Palestinian cultural heritage"" at the Matenadaran Institute of Ancient Manuscripts in Yerevan as part of an agreement between Armenia and the Palestinians, News.am reported.

It was quoting a statement made by Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Vahan Kostanyan at the high-level UN conference on the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, in New York. In his speech, Kostanyan reaffirmed Armenia's commitment to the two-state solution, stating that ""lasting peace and stability are only possible through the existence of two neighbouring independent states"".

Kostanyan also welcomed France's intention to recognise ""Palestine"" and the UK's intention to follow suit, noting Armenia's pride in having hosted a meeting between the French and Palestinian foreign ministers during the Yerevan Dialogue diplomatic conference earlier in 2025.

Despite limited resources, he said, Armenia has made consistent efforts to support the Palestinian people - including sending humanitarian aid to Gaza and backing the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).

Kostanyan emphasised the importance of protecting Christian communities and heritage in both states, noting that Armenia is particularly concerned about preserving holy sites in the ""Holy Land"".

""Armenia hopes that the historic status quo governing the holy sites in Jerusalem will be fully upheld,"" he said, calling it ""a cornerstone of interfaith solidarity and peaceful coexistence"".

Red Cross to stop visiting Armenian detainees in Baku

The families of Armenians held in Baku have been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that it will no longer be able to visit the detainees, Azatutyun.am, the Armenian service of Radio Liberty, has reported.

This news has caused serious concern among the detainees' relatives, as the ICRC was the only independent international organisation able to access the detained Armenians, monitor their conditions and health, provide necessary clothing and hygiene supplies, and facilitate video calls with family members, the report said.

One relative told Azatutyun that the ICRC was ""the last hope"" for the families and the detainees. ""The only means was the Red Cross, which connected families and brought some light to these people's lives. And now this has been cut off too,"" the person said.

Zara Amatuni, the head of Communication for the ICRC delegation in Armenia, told Azatutyun that the last visit to the Armenians took place in June, and there have been no visits in July. According to Amatuni, the ICRC's Baku office will soon suspend operation at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities.

""Naturally, this situation is causing disruptions to our normal work process,"" she said.

Official data from Azerbaijan indicate that 23 Armenians are currently held in Baku prisons. Their only contact with relatives now is through phone calls arranged by the Azerbaijani authorities.

The pro-opposition Joghovurd daily cited the families of the detainees said that Azerbaijan has now fully prohibited visits to both civilian and military and political Armenian captives. Previously, limited contact was allowed once a month via video calls, but even that has been cut off, the report said.

The daily added that Baku is unwilling to make concessions, while the peace agreement with Baku promised by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan appears increasingly uncertain.

Pundit says no unified stance in Iran on 'Zangazur corridor'

Expert on international relations Grigor Balasanyan has told News.am reformist and conservative forces in Iran no longer have a unified position on the issue of the potential so-called Zangazur corridor which is to link mainland Azerbaijan to its Naxcivan exclave via southern Armenia along the Iranian border.

Iran has long opposed the Zangazur corridor project which it says it fears would cut off its access to Armenia.

The expert noted that serious events are unfolding in Iran, where the political elite is currently divided into two factions. The reformists, led by President Massoud Pezeshkian, are no longer strongly opposed to the opening of the corridor.

""In fact, Pezeshkian recently gave an interview in which he made a controversial statement, saying that issues related to restoring routes along Iran's north-western border are trivial and not worth worrying about. In other words, the Iranian president considers the opening of the 'Zangazur corridor' an insignificant matter,"" Balasanyan said, noting that an opposite stance is held by the team of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who sharply criticise Pezeshkian, warning of destructive consequences for Iran from the corridor's opening.

The expert also said that Pezeshkian's visit to Azerbaijan's Karabakh in July for a summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation was also symbolic following the 12-day Iran-Israel war. ""Knowing well that Iranian territory is constantly shelled from Azerbaijan, choosing to attend the meeting implies agreement with everything happening against your [Pezeshkian's] state,"" the expert said.

Armenian president visits border checkpoint, communities near Iran

As part of his visit to Armenia's southern Syunik Province, Armenia's ceremonial President Vahagn Khachaturyan has toured the Meghri customs checkpoint at the border with Iran, where he was briefed by Deputy Head of the State Revenue Committee Karen Tamazyan on current operations and plans for a new facility at the checkpoint to boost transport links. The new facility will be ready in 2026, Tamazyan said.

Khachaturyan referred to the government's Crossroads of Peace initiative, expressing concern that the planned facility may not be adequate to support the project's full implementation or to ensure reliable transport connectivity along the Middle Corridor.

The president also visited the communities of Chakaten and Nerkin Hand, where he conversed with residents, discussed local issues and inquired about ongoing and planned government programmes in border areas. Khachaturyan visited a tunnel under construction as part of the North-South Road Corridor Project, where he observed the progress of ongoing construction work.

Also, Khachaturyan visited a military unit, reviewed living conditions and awarded several soldiers for their exemplary service.

Armenia-China defence relations

Armenian Armed Forces General Staff Chief Edvard Asryan has attended an event at the Chinese embassy marking the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army, Armenpress has reported.

Speaking at the event, Asryan stated that defence cooperation between two countries, including between the defence ministries, has developed successfully in recent years. He noted that China is currently one of Armenia's key international partners, and further development of bilateral cooperation is among the priorities of Armenia's foreign policy.

""Armenia-China relations are based on mutual respect, a high level of political dialogue and mutual understanding. Armenia is actively participating in the Belt and Road initiative proposed by the Chinese president, which aligns with Armenia's Crossroads of Peace project,"" Asryan said.

He said the Armenian government places strong emphasis on developing cooperation with China in the defence sector.

In this context, he highlighted that in 2023 and 2024, Armenian Defence Minister Suren Papikyan took part in the 10th and 11th Xiangshan international security forums held in Beijing to have productive meetings that helped further strengthen and expand bilateral cooperation.

Asryan added that annual bilateral cooperation programmes include delegation exchanges and expert-level working meetings across key areas of mutual interest. He said Armenia-China relations are currently at a high level, and further development is planned in several key areas.

In the field of military science, close relations have been established between the Academy of Military Sciences of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Armenia's Vazgen Sargsyan Military University of the Ministry of Defence and National Defence Research University.

Chinese ambassador to Armenia Li Songwei said that China's global projects, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, aim to support development, and that countries like Armenia have shown interest and support.

Praising the steady development of relations between Armenia and China over the past 33 years, the diplomat said both nations respect each other's sovereignty and support one another on key national issues.

He confirmed that China will support Armenia's bid to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation during its chairmanship this year. Li added that Beijing is ready to deepen practical cooperation and strengthen peace and stability in the region.

In July, Armenia announced it seeks to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as part of its strategy to pursue a balanced foreign policy. Prime Minister Pashinyan dismissed speculations that its possible SCO membership contradicts Armenia's position on the Moscow-led military alliance CSTO, noting that several countries are members of both organisations.

Premier's falling approval rating reportedly sparks search for new political challenges

Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's approval rating has dropped to 13%, but Armenia's traditional opposition forces have failed to gain ground, Past daily has said. The newspaper argued that Pashinyan is now looking for a ""dangerous opponent"" among other forces that are capable of gaining the trust of Armenian society which is disappointed both with the ruling ""velvet"" government and former authorities.

Among those Pashinyan reportedly viewed as potential threats were the Armenian Apostolic Church and influential philanthropists, Past said. It said that Pashinyan deliberately provoked conflict with the Church in an effort to weaken it and reshape it to make it fit his ""velvet revolution"" narrative.

The arrest of influential businessman Samvel Karapetyan and his announcement to form a new political party marked a critical turning point, signaling a potential new challenge to Prime Minister Pashinyan's power, the daily said. It said that Karapetyan approaches politics as business and suggests that this approach manifests in his ""in our own way"" statement declared by Karapetyan's team, which has greatly unsettled the authorities. The daily concluded that unlike ""insulting and imprisoning"" clergymen, the new political force led by Karapetyan may prove far harder for Pashinyan to suppress."

US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the sanctions ""are not intended to target the people of Zimbabwe"".

Mangwana tweeted in response that the termination of the sanctions regime ""was massive. A great vindication of [Mnangagwa's] foreign policy"", but that ""as long our president is under sanctions, Zimbabwe remains under illegal sanctions"".

The prime minister also directed to compile a report on the damages to private properties and ordered early restoration of communication infrastructure, leading Urdu newspaper Jang reported.&#160;

The development received extensive coverage in the frontline newspapers and online media outlets. &#160;Select editorials hailed PM's visit to Balochistan.&#160;

""It's good to see that an elected PM decided to visit Gwadar a day after taking charge and went on a maiden visit to a province that has been neglected for decades,"" prominent English-language newspaper The News said. &#160;

""The idea of Pakistan as a federation is not to dismiss the grievances of smaller provinces but to give equal rights and autonomy to all provinces,"" it added. &#160;

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to Gwadar ""highlights the gravity of the situation with his announcement of a comprehensive relief package, encompassing monetary compensation for the families of the deceased, support for the injured and assistance for those whose homes have been damaged,"" prominent English-language newspaper The Express Tribune said. &#160;

""Amidst the sorrow for lives lost, solidarity with affected communities and a steadfast commitment to collective action are imperative,"" it added. &#160;&#160;

Army rejects claims of 'interference' in electoral process&#160;

The Pakistan Army on 5 March rejected ""unsubstantiated allegations"" of ""interference"" in the electoral process, the military's media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. &#160;&#160;

The development came during the 263rd Corps Commanders' Conference (CCC) chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi city of Punjab province. &#160;

ISPR said the ""forum noted that the Armed Forces of Pakistan at a great peril to their primary responsibility, provided security environment for the conduct of GE-24 [general elections 2024] as per the given mandate, and had nothing to do with the electoral process"". &#160;

However, the forum expressed ""dismay that some vested small segments of polity and media especially social media have been maligning Armed Forces of Pakistan with unsubstantiated allegations of interference which is highly deplorable,"" ISPR said.

""It's unfortunate that rather than focusing on real issues such as good governance, economic recovery, political stability and public wellbeing, entire focus of such vested elements is on creating political instability and uncertainty by attempting to scapegoat others for their own failings,"" ISPR added.

The ISPR further said that the forum emphasised that ""due legal processes be followed with evidence and proof rather than resorting to unconstitutional and uncalled for baseless political rhetoric and emotional outbursts"".

""Forum noted with satisfaction the smooth democratic transition of power in the Centre [federal government] and provinces,"" ISPR said adding forum hoped that the post elections environment brings in ""desired political and economic stability resulting into peace and prosperity for the people of Pakistan"". &#160;&#160;

The ISRP said that forum paid rich tribute to the supreme sacrifices of Shuhadas [martyrs] including officers and men of the armed forces, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and the citizens who have laid their lives for ensuring peace and stability in the country. &#160;

""Forum resolved that terrorists, their facilitators and abettors, working on behest of hostile forces to destabilise Pakistan, will be dealt with full might of the state,"" ISPR said. &#160;

The ISPR further said that COAS directed commanders to ""continue consolidating the gains of efforts against terrorism and militancy"". &#160;

ISPR said that in line with the resolve of the honourable prime minister of Pakistan, the forum committed that ""planners, instigators, abettors and perpetrators/desecrators of Shuhada Monuments and attackers of military installations on 9 May, would certainly be brought to justice under the relevant provisions of the law and Constitution"".&#160;

The workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) have been accused of ransacking public property and military installations following arrest of party founder, Imran Khan that day. &#160;&#160;

""The forum expressed concerns over continued repression of Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (India-administered Kashmir) and condemned the unabated human rights violations by India,"" ISPR said adding the forum reaffirmed that Pakistan shall continue to support Kashmiris ""politically, diplomatically and morally at all levels"".

The forum also expressed complete solidarity with the Palestinians and condemned ""serious human rights violations and war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza"", ISPR said. &#160;&#160;

The development received prominent and largely factual coverage in the frontline newspapers and online media outlets. &#160;

The developments were also discussed on X (formerly Twitter) in Pakistan as of 09:00 GMT on 6 March under prominent trends #AsimMunir and ""Duffers"". &#160;&#160;

Several posts called Army leadership as ""duffers"". &#160;&#160;

Resolution for release of ex-PM Khan submitted to parliament &#160;

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on 5 March submitted a resolution to the lower house of the parliament, the National Assembly Secretariat, seeking release of the party's founder Imran Khan and several other political leaders and journalists, local media reported. &#160;

Khan has been lodged in a jail in several cases since 5 August, 2023. &#160;

PTI leaders including Omar Ayub Khan and Asad Qaiser submitted the resolution, pro-military Urdu TV news channel Samaa TV reported. &#160;

The resolution demanded immediate release of Khan, emphasising that ""he is a prominent leader of the Muslim world,"" the news report added.

The resolution said that cases against the PTI founder were registered to ""politically victimise"" him and keep him away from the masses, Urdu TV news channel ARY News reported. &#160;

Meanwhile, Qaiser said that the PTI would unite all political forces and launch a ""movement"" against a ""rigged election"", the news report added. &#160;

Separately, newly elected Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, called on Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi city of Punjab to discuss cabinet formation in the province, Ausaf, an Urdu newspaper generally critical of PML-N reported. &#160;

Khan, in the meeting, reportedly proposed 15-member provincial cabinet, the news report added. &#160;

Talking to media outside the Adiala Jail, Gandapur said that Khan will decide on ""reconciliation with the establishment [reference to military establishment]"" The News reported. &#160;

PTI has been accusing the establishment of interference in politics and helping the opposition oust Khan's government in April 2022. &#160;

The development received extensive coverage in the frontline newspapers and online media outlets.

""The people of the province trusted the PTI and voted for Gandapur to provide them an opportunity to serve the nation instead of satisfying their personal enmity or the party's tussle with the adversaries,"" prominent English-language newspaper The Frontier Post said in an editorial.

""Hence, civic groups and politicians must think about the country and the masses instead of their politics and power,"" it added.

Social buzz &#160;

The top trend on X in Pakistan as of 09:00 GMT on 6 March was ""Article 6"" which appeared in posts urging to try Chief Election Commissioner, Sikandar Sultan Raja, under Article 6 of the Constitution for ""illegally"" distributing PTI's reserved seats in the National and provincial assemblies among other political parties.&#160;

Iran welcomes Armenia-Azerbaijan deal, warns against foreign presence

The Iranian Foreign Ministry has ""welcomed the finalisation of the text of the peace agreement"" between Azerbaijan and Armenia, describing the deal as ""an important step in achieving lasting peace in the region"".

In a statement issued this morning, the Foreign Ministry said Iran was ready to cooperate with Baku and Yerevan to ""safeguard peace, stability, and economic development of the region through bilateral and regional cooperation"".

The statement however expressed Iran's concern regarding the negative consequences of ""any external intervention"", particularly ""in close proximity to shared borders which could disrupt the security and sustainable stability of the region"".

As part of the deal, the US will help build a major transit corridor, previously referred to as Zangazur and now named ""the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity"", to connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan (Naxcivan) exclave - separated by Armenian territory.

Iran has long opposed Azerbaijan's plans to open the Zangazur corridor, via southern Armenia, repeatedly warning against any attempt to shift geopolitical borders in the Caucasus. Tehran is worried that the establishment of the corridor will sever its land border with Armenia.

Iranian state TV and radio reported on the deal this morning, highlighting Russia's warnings against US control over the corridor. Several Iranian newspapers this morning also reacted to the signing of the agreement.

Prominent hardline Keyhan daily said ""Baku's policy of becoming a regional energy hub is in complete conflict with the interests of Iran and Russia"". The article was headlined: ""Armenia gives green light to US for 100-year lease of Zangazur Corridor"".

State broadcaster's Jaam-e Jam labelled the development ""Trump's chaos in the Caucasus"", while the conservative Farhikhtegan described the deal as Armenia's ""surrender to Washington's plan to destroy"" the country.

The conservative Siasat-e Rouz daily said that the plan ""can be considered a new American-Zionist conspiracy against the geopolitics of the Caucasus and Iran's regional and global position"".

Initial online reaction to 'Trump Route'

Some hardline pro-establishment users on X accused President Massoud Pezeshkian of having overlooked the importance of the development and maintained that remaining silent about the so-called Zangazur corridor was ""tantamount to treason"". They argued that neglecting it now would ""harm Iran's national interests for centuries to come"".

Hardliner and conspiracy theorist Ali Akbar Raefipour argued that the US was poking ""Iran's sensitivity"" to its borders through the project.

Meanwhile, foreign-based Iranian analyst Hossein Aghaie stressed Iran ""couldn't do a damn thing"" to prevent the plans for the corridor.

A pro-Trump anti-establishment user welcomed the event as a ""historic moment"", as Trump was at the centre of it.

Press highlights pro-Hezbollah protest, rejects disarmament plan

Several Iranian newspapers this morning reacted to the Lebanese government's approval of a US proposal that would see the disarmament of the Iran-backed group, Hezbollah.

Hardline Javan daily, affiliated with the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), described the approval as ""Kill shot at ""Lebanon's 40-year unity"" and said ""the Lebanese government approved the Hezbollah disarmament plan by vote and without consensus"".

The ultraconservative Keyhan daily quoted Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to the supreme leader, as saying that ""disarming Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces is an American-Zionist plan"" against the ""Islamic resistance"".

Jaam-e Jam called it a ""pipe dream of disarmament"" and conservative Qods said ""the disarmament of the Resistance"" - a term used to describe Iran's allies and proxies - was a ""dangerous fantasy"".

The reformist Hammihan and the moderate Sazandegi newspapers were among several outlets that highlighted protests by Hezbollah supporters against the move.

Tehran condemns Israel's plan military occupation of Gaza

Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmail Baqai yesterday ""strongly condemned"" Israel's ""complete military occupation"" and its ""forcing"" Gazans out of the Gaza Strip. Baqai called the decision ""a plan to complete the genocide of the Palestinian nation"".

He said it is ""each and every government's legal and ethical responsibility to put an end to genocide…in the occupied Palestine"".

Keyhan daily highlighted on its front page Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi's call for an emergency meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to address what he described as a ""systematic destruction"" of Gaza's civilian population and Israel's alleged plans to permanently occupy the territory.

On 7 August, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to ""take over"" Gaza City and give Palestinians a deadline of 7 October to evacuate the city and move to the south, Israeli media reported.

Iran condemns US 'interventionist' policies against Venezuela

Iran's Foreign Ministry yesterday condemned the US for what it described as its ""interventionist behaviours"" and positions against Venezuela and said that Iran will stand in solidarity with the people of Venezuela.

""Iran stands in solidarity with the people and government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and condemns US unlawful interventions in Venezuela's domestic affairs,"" said a statement posted to the Foreign Ministry's X account in English and Spanish yesterday.

The US has doubled the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50m, accusing him of being ""one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world"".

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro was directly linked to drug smuggling operations."

Several areas of Pakistan have seen disruption in access to X since 17 Feb, when former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha accused the chief election commissioner and the chief justice of Pakistan of rigging the&#160; 8 February general elections.

""The Yemeni army has a distinctive military maritime expertise built on practical effectiveness rather than drills or studies of the enemy from afar based on the theories of experts influenced by US propaganda,"" he added.

The Houthis, who oppose the internationally-recognised Aden-based government, refer to their own forces as the ""Yemeni armed forces"".

The statement comes on the same day Houthi leader Abdulmalek al-Houthi announced the group was &#8216;widening&#8217; its maritime actions by targeting ships ""linked to Israel"" transiting via the Indian Ocean towards the Cape of Good Hope, on the southern tip of Africa.

Dancing in a mixed-gender environment is&#160;prohibited by Iran's Islamic law.

The arrest of the two young women, who danced in Haji Pirouz (an Iranian Nowruz character) suits ahead of the Nowruz holidays, has sparked anger among Iranians online. &#160;The Nowruz (Iranian new year) holiday starts on 20 March.&#160;

Social media users are also angered by the charges of ""spreading corruption"" facing Mahvar Ahmadi, daughter of poet Ahmad Reza Ahmadi, who had attended her father's funeral without the mandatory hijab. They highlight the fact that the authorities are seeking to tighten their grip on hijab enforcement straight after the 1 March elections, which were marked by a record low turnout of 41%.

Users underlined the establishment's bid to retract a fine of 30m rials (around $50 at the free market rate) from the bank accounts of women defying hijab as soon as the Nowruz holidays are over.

Situated on the borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan, the&#160;marginalised&#160;and impoverished province of&#160;Sistan-Baluchestan&#160;is home to some Sunni militants, and is also an entry point for smuggled goods, drugs and arms.

The Sunni militant group&#160;Jaish&#160;al-Adl, which is active in the province and has launched repeated attacks on security forces in the region,&#160;has not claimed responsibility for the attack.

However, it reportedly also says that impact of Maha Vikas Aghadi [MVA, coalition mainly comprising Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray party, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-Sharadchandra Pawar faction and Congress party] along with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) might be more than that of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

Editorial on implementation of citizen amendment law

""In short, this decision is not likely to have much impact besides polarisation of Hindu votes. In the event, these non-Muslims without citizenship gain citizenship, they cannot vote in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. That is because voters lists have been published. But undoubtedly, the decision is part of BJP's Hindutva [ideology of Hindu nationalism] agenda. Whether or not people approve of the journey in this direction has to be decided by Indian voters in these elections [Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by parliament in 2019 grants citizenship to non-Muslim refugees-&#160;Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians- entering India by 31 December 2014 from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

BBCSAP0020240304ek3400001,"Pakistan's Samaa TV show on new prime minister, media censorship","The following is a summary of the talk show ""Mere Sawal"" (My Questions), hosted by anchor Muneeb Farooq on moderate Samaa News TV in Urdu at 15:00 GMT on 3 March 2024. The programme invites politicians and analysts to express their opinions on important issues.

Anchor Muneeb Farooq announced Shehbaz Sharif (president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, PML-N) was elected as the prime minister on 3 March and he delivered a speech after his election. He noted the opposition commented that in his speech, Sharif only spoke about problems and the new government does not have a solution to those problems. He said none of the governments which came into power in the recent years had a solution. He further noted in his speech, Sharif ""took ownership"" of measures taken against those involved in the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PTI). He added Sharif spoke about the need for a ""charter of reconciliation"".","Farooq spoke with PML-N politician Ataullah Tarar and asked him why the speech of the opposition's candidate for prime ministership, Omar Ayub Khan, was not shown on PTV (state-owned broadcaster) but Sharif's speech was broadcast live. Tarar said Sharif delivered a ""balanced speech"" and did not talk about political revenge or chaos, instead he spoke about national harmony and reconciliation. He added he spoke about the economy, foreign policy and every section of the society, including labourers, farmers and women.

Tarar noted live coverage of Omar Khan's speech was interrupted but claimed it was not in the knowledge of the prime minister or anyone else. He said when pointed out, the deputy speaker took notice immediately and the transmission was resumed. He was of the view that the speech should have been ""transmitted live end to end"" and said he would ask the speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament) to ensure that speeches of the opposition members are covered live.

Farooq played a clip of a statement by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) chief Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman in which he claimed the elections were stolen and the [military] establishment is responsible for the theft. He added this is why the JUI will sit in the opposition this time. Farooq asked Tarar how he would respond to Rehman's allegations. Tarar insisted the election results should be accepted by all. He questioned if the establishment was involved in rigging, then why did Ali Amin Gandapur (PTI politician allegedly involved in the 9 May attacks) win the election and why several prominent PML-N politicians lost the polls. He said complaints about election results should be taken to election tribunals.

Tarar said he is against the blocking of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) or any other platform but emphasised that all political parties should agree upon a ""code of conduct"" regarding social media. He remarked 9 May was a ""dangerous plan"" and noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said any prisoner being kept in jail without evidence of involvement in the 9 May incidents should be released.

Senior journalist Mazhar Abbas said he has been demanding that PTV should be a free and independent channel. He noted PTV was to be a national TV channel, but it has been turned into a state-controlled channel. He claimed there is an ""undeclared censorship"" in place at the moment and digital media is being controlled. He was of the view that freeing the media would be a challenge for Sharif's new government.

Speaking about the allegations of election rigging, Abbas said a ""high-powered commission"" should be formed and all parties should agree that they would accept the findings of the commission. He was of the view that the 9 May cases have been used for political advantage.

Farooq asked analyst Mansoor Ali Khan whether a commission could be formed. Khan claimed the PML-N would never want to form a commission because it has gotten into power and Shehbaz Sharif has been elected as the prime minister. He further claimed there is no need for a commission to investigate as journalists saw that the results were changed. He said Omar Khan's speech was censored because a person holding former prime minister Imran Khan's picture stood on his side and PTV did not want to show that picture. He remarked this is the state of censorship that the country is currently facing.

Islamic State group (IS) has released rare images depicting the ""daily life"" of its militants in Mozambique, in a clear effort to project strength, especially following the group's recent ""feats"" in the country.","IS published the set of 25 photos in the name of its so-called Mozambique Province branch on 10 March via its channels on Telegram .

The images show militants engaged in a wide range of activities, including performing group prayers, watching videos, feasting together, attending lectures, and preparing and setting off for battle.

They were published a day before the start of Ramadan, which most Muslims marked on 11 March.

Such ""daily life"" images used to be a staple of IS propaganda in the jihadist group's heyday, and used for recruitment when it controlled large swathes of territory in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. They became scarce over the years.

The last time the group published such images was in July 2022, depicting the ""daily life"" of militants in Syria.

The latest Mozambique images suggest that militants in that country now enjoy relative strength and security in areas where they operate.

They compliment the group's recent surge in the north of the country, where it has been claiming a significant number of attacks this year mostly against Christian communities, as well as reaching out to Muslims in the region.

Al-Naba said that the following day, on 6 March, IS militants attacked a ""pro-government militia"" checkpoint on the Menaka-Ansongo road, allegedly killing one militia member ""while the rest fled"". It shared a picture said to show the slain militia fighter.&#160;

The two other attacks in Mali listed in the roundup were the killing of 19 al-Qaeda fighters, including a top commander, in Gao; and the killing of four Benin ""Christians"" on the Labbezanga-Ansongo road. (See here and here)

Attack in Burkina Faso&#160;

Moving to neighbouring Burkina Faso, al-Naba portrayed IS militants there as defenders of Muslims against the aggression and ""criminality"" of al-Qaeda fighters.

It said that on 27 February, al-Qaeda militants tried to raid and rob Muslim residents in ""the village of"" Gorgadji in Dori, north-eastern Burkina Faso.

This attempt, al-Naba continued, prompted IS militants to respond and attack the al-Qaeda ""raiders"", triggering clashes in which two al-Qaeda fighters were killed, a third was captured, ""while the rest fled"".&#160;

As such, al-Naba triumphantly said, IS prevented the rival militants from looting the village.&#160;

Both IS and al-Qaeda often accuse each other of starting aggressions, with each claiming to be defending Muslims against the other. While IS typically calls al-Qaeda militants ""apostates"" and ""militiamen""; al-Qaeda calls IS members ""ultra-extremists"" (khawarij).&#160;

Islamic State group (IS) has published a set of photos showing a suicide bombing against African task force personnel in north-east Nigeria.","IS issued seven photos on behalf of its so-called West Africa Province branch (ISWAP), via its accounts on Telegram on 21 March.&#160;

The photos appeared to refer to an attack in north-eastern Nigeria that IS claimed on 18 March. IS had said the attack killed and wounded a number of ""African coalition"" personnel, including two officers, presumably affiliated to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). The MNJTF is tasked with fighting jihadist insurgency in the Lake Chad basin.

One photo showed an image of the purported suicide bomber, named as Abu Adam al-Nijri, a nom de guerre that suggests he was from Niger.&#160;

The set of photos concluded with a cloud of smoke which IS claims captured the moment of the suicide bombing. &#160;

Text accompanying the images added that the attack had taken place near the town of Gashagar in Borno state. In recent weeks, ISWAP has been fending off army assaults on their positions in the country's north-eastern state.

Islamic State group (IS) has claimed the beheading of three people described as Christians in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).","IS issued the claim on 19 March via its accounts on Telegram, and in the name of its &#8220;Central Africa Province&#8221; branch (ISCAP).

It said IS militants attacked ""the village of Masusi in Beni&#8221; in eastern DR Congo, and captured and later killed the three individuals. It is unclear if IS meant the town of Masisi in the same region.&#160;

While the group did not say when the attack took place, the breaking-news stylisation of the claim suggested it happened on the same day.&#160;

A day earlier, on 18 March, ISCAP issued three separate claims for similar attacks in eastern DR Congo, including in &#8220;Masusi&#8221;, saying its militants killed a total of five &#8220;Christians&#8221; and captured another five.&#160;

Christian civilians have had the lion&#8217;s share of IS attacks in DR Congo since last year, when 80% of the group&#8217;s claimed operations in the country were said to have targeted Christian communities.&#160;

Islamic State group (IS) has claimed that multiple soldiers were ""killed and injured"" during a suicide bombing, in response to an army assault on militant camps in Alagarno forest in Nigeria's north-eastern Borno state.","IS made the claim a statement it issued on 3 March on behalf of IS's West Africa Province branch (ISWAP), via the group's official Telegram channels.

The statement said that militants clashed with soldiers who ""sought to advance upon mujahidin positions"" in the vicinity of Alagarno forest on 28 February.

It added that during this incident IS staged a suicide attack, perpetrated by an individual identified as Haroun al-Ansari ""killing and injuring a number of"" soldiers, and ""damaging several vehicles"".

ISWAP in the past has frequently staged suicide attacks using SVBIEDs (suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devises) in response to army crackdowns against militant camps. Most ISWAP suicide attackers have been identified with the nom de guerre ""al-Ansari"", which suggests that the individual was a local of the country or region.

See: Briefing: IS uses suicide bombers to repel army offensive in Nigeria (May 2023)

A statement by the army regarding a military operation in the Alagarno region on the same day provided a rather different account of events. It said that despite the use of an SVBIED, militants ""fell under the overwhelming superior fire power of the troops, forcing them to abandon their stronghold, armaments and equipment in disarray"".

The army statement reported the capture of large amounts of equipment, including an armoured vehicle. Reporting indicated that three IS militants were killed in the operation. No mention was made of possible military casualties.

Uzbekistan's external labour migration agency has called on the country's citizens in Russia not to visit crowded places after the recent terrorist attack on a concert hall in Moscow, the privately-owned news website Gazeta.uz reported on 27 March.","""In particular, Uzbek citizens should carry documents confirming their identity and their right to stay or work in the country, they should not visit crowded places without a reason, nor communicate with strangers or suspicious people, nor keep prohibited photo, audio and video material on their phones and other devices. When planning a trip, they are recommended to arrive at the railway station or airport earlier than planned,"" the report said, citing the agency.

The agency's press secretary Ortikkhuja Norov said that there were more than 1m Uzbek migrants in Russia.

He also denied reports that Uzbek and other Central Asian migrants in Russia were facing problems after the recent terrorist attack in Moscow.

""Most of the allegations about migrants being denied individual business licences and being expelled from the country are untrue, especially as far as Uzbek citizens are concerned. As for the videos that have emerged about individual business licences not being issued, we have spoken to the staff of a migration centre in Russia and they said that such rumours are not true,"" Norov said, as quoted by the website.

He admitted that document checks and raids may have taken place amid the current heightened security measures, but said they had been carried out ""before"".

Norov also said there was no need for Uzbek migrants to rush home at the moment.

""There is no need to return home as soon as possible. We can see the developments, Russia's official position is not against migrant workers either. I think that migrants can continue their work,"" Norov added.

On 22 March, a group of Tajik gunmen attacked Crocus City Hall as a concert was about to begin, shooting people indiscriminately. Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The latest figures put the death toll at 140, with hundreds injured. &#160;

The second statement detailed an attack to the west of the town of Sukhna in which IS claimed to have taken prisoner four soldiers before interrogating and shooting them dead. The 'urgent' styling of this statement indicates that this attack likely occurred on the same day as its publication.

Earlier in March, IS claimed a similar attack in which it captured and shot dead three army personnel near Sukhna.

There has been a significant uptick in IS attack claims in Syria since the beginning of 2024, especially in Deir al-Zour, Raqqa, and Homs. IS has claimed an average of over 30 attacks per month so far in 2024, roughly three times the monthly number in 2023.

NYTFEED020240325ek3p00001,4 Men Showing Signs of Beating Charged With Terrorism After Moscow Attack,"The four accused of carrying out an assault at a concert hall near Moscow are migrant laborers from Tajikistan. They face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The four men suspected of carrying out a bloody attack on a concert hall near Moscow, killing at least 137 people, were arraigned in a district court late Sunday and charged with committing a terrorist act.","The four, who were from Tajikistan but worked as migrant laborers in Russia, were remanded in custody until May 22, according to state and independent media outlets reporting from the proceedings, at Basmanny District Court. They face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The press service of the court only announced that the first two defendants, Dalerjon B. Mirzoyev and Saidakrami M. Rachalbalizoda, pleaded guilty to the charges. It did not specify any plea from the other two, Mediazona, an independent news outlet, reported.

The men looked severely battered and injured as each of them was brought into the courtroom separately. Videos of them being tortured and beaten while under interrogation circulated widely on Russian social media.

Muhammadsobir Z. Fayzov, a 19-year-old barber and the youngest of the men charged, was rolled into the courtroom from a hospital emergency room on a tall, orange wheelchair, attended by a doctor, the reports said. He sat propped up in the wheelchair inside the glass cage for defendants, wearing a catheter and an open hospital gown with his chest partially exposed. Often speaking in Tajik through a translator, he answered questions about his biography quietly and stammered, according to Mediazona.

Mr. Rachabalizoda, 30, had a large bandage hanging off the right side of his head where interrogators had sliced off a part of his ear and forced it into his mouth, the reports said, with the cutting captured in a video that spread online.

The judge allowed the press to witness only parts of the hearings, citing concerns that sensitive details about the investigation might be revealed or the lives of court workers put at risk. It is not an unusual ruling in Russia.

Russia’s Federal Security Services announced on Saturday that 11 people had been detained, including the four charged men, who were arrested after the car they were fleeing in was intercepted by the authorities 230 miles southwest of Moscow.

In the attack, on Friday night, four gunmen opened fire inside the hall just as a rock concert by the group Piknik was due to start. They also set off explosive devices that ignited the building and eventually caused its roof to collapse. Aside from the dead, there were 182 injured, and more than 100 remain hospitalized, according to the regional health ministry.

President Vladimir V. Putin used the fact that the highway where the men were detained leads to Ukraine to suggest that the attack was somehow linked to Ukraine’s war effort. But the United States has said repeatedly that the attack was the work of an extremist jihadi organization, the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility.

The first charged, Mr. Mirzoyev, who had a black eye and cuts and bruises all over his face, leaned for support against the glass wall of the court cage as the charge against him was read. Mr. Mirzoyev, 32, has four children and had a temporary residence permit in the southern Siberian city of Novosibirsk, but it had expired, the reports said.

Mr. Rachabalizoda, married with a child, said he was legally registered in Russia but did not remember where.

The fourth man charged, Shamsidin Fariduni, 25, married with an 8-month-old baby, worked in a factory producing parquet in the Russian city of Podolsk, just southwest of Moscow. He had also worked as a handyman in Krasnogorsk, the Moscow suburb where the attack took place at Crocus City Hall, at a concert venue within a sprawling shopping complex just outside the Moscow city limits.

The Islamic State has been able to recruit hundreds of adherents among migrant laborers from Central Asia in Russia who are often angry about the discrimination they frequently face.

NYTFEED020240323ek3n00439,Deadly Moscow Attack Shatters Putin’s Security Promise to Russians,"The tragedy outside Moscow is a blow to a leader riding an aura of confidence only days after a stage-managed election victory.

Less than a week ago, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia claimed a fifth term with his highest-ever share of the vote, using a stage-managed election to show the nation and the world that he was firmly in control.","Just days later came a searing counterpoint: His vaunted security apparatus failed to prevent Russia’s deadliest terrorist attack in 20 years.

The assault on Friday, which killed at least 133 people at a concert hall in suburban Moscow, was a blow to Mr. Putin’s aura as a leader for whom national security is paramount. That is especially true after two years of a war in Ukraine that he describes as key to Russia’s survival — and which he cast as his top priority after the election last Sunday.

“The election demonstrated a seemingly confident victory,” Aleksandr Kynev, a Russian political scientist, said in a phone interview from Moscow. “And suddenly, against the backdrop of a confident victory, there’s this demonstrative humiliation.”

Mr. Putin seemed blindsided by the assault. It took him more than 19 hours to address the nation about the attack, the deadliest in Russia since the 2004 school siege in Beslan, in the country’s south, which claimed 334 lives. When he did, the Russian leader said nothing about the mounting evidence that a branch of the Islamic State committed the attack.

Instead, Mr. Putin hinted that Ukraine was behind the tragedy and said the assailants had acted “just like the Nazis,” who “once carried out massacres in the occupied territories” — evoking his frequent, false description of present-day Ukraine as being run by neo-Nazis.

“Our common duty now — our comrades at the front, all citizens of the country — is to be together in one formation,” Mr. Putin said at the end of a five-minute speech, trying to conflate the fight against terrorism with his invasion of Ukraine.

The question is how much of the Russian public will buy into his argument. They might ask whether Mr. Putin, with the invasion and his conflict with the West, truly has the country’s security interests at heart — or whether he is woefully forsaking them, as many of his opponents say he is.

The fact that Mr. Putin apparently ignored a warning from the United States about a potential terrorist attack is likely to deepen the skepticism. Instead of acting on the warnings and tightening security, he dismissed them as “provocative statements.”

“All this resembles outright blackmail and an intention to intimidate and destabilize our society,” Mr. Putin said on Tuesday in a speech to the F.S.B., Russia’s domestic intelligence agency, referring to the Western warnings. After the attack on Friday, some of his exiled critics have cited his response as evidence of the president’s detachment from Russia’s true security concerns.

Rather than keeping society safe from actual, violent terrorists, those critics say, Mr. Putin has directed his sprawling security services to pursue dissidents, journalists and anyone deemed a threat to the Kremlin’s definition of “traditional values.”

A case in point: Just hours before the attack, state media reported that the Russian authorities had added “the L.G.B.T. movement” to an official list of “terrorists and extremists”; Russia had already outlawed the gay rights movement last year. Terrorism was also among the many charges prosecutors leveled against Aleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned opposition leader who died last month.

“In a country in which counterterrorism special forces chase after online commenters,” Ruslan Leviev, an exiled Russian military analyst, wrote in a social media post on Saturday, “terrorists will always feel free.”

Even as the Islamic State repeatedly claimed responsibility for the attack and Ukraine denied any involvement, the Kremlin’s messengers pushed into overdrive to try to persuade the Russian public that this was merely a ruse.

Olga Skabeyeva, a state television host, wrote on Telegram that Ukrainian military intelligence had found assailants “who would look like ISIS. But this is no ISIS.” Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the state-run RT television network, wrote that reports of Islamic State responsibility amounted to a “basic sleight of hand” by the American news media.

On a prime-time television talk show on the state-run Channel 1, Russia’s best-known ultraconservative ideologue, Aleksandr Dugin, declared that Ukraine’s leadership and “their puppet masters in the Western intelligence services” had surely organized the attack.

It was an effort to “undermine trust in the president,” Mr. Dugin said, and it showed regular Russians that they had no choice but to unite behind Mr. Putin’s war against Ukraine.

Mr. Dugin’s daughter was killed in a car bombing near Moscow in 2022 that U.S. officials said was indeed authorized by parts of the Ukrainian government, but without American involvement.

U.S. officials have said there is no evidence of Ukrainian involvement in the concert hall attack, and Ukrainian officials ridiculed the Russian accusations. Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, said Mr. Putin’s claim that the attackers had fled toward Ukraine and intended to cross into it, with the help of the Ukrainian authorities, made no sense.

In recent months, Mr. Putin has appeared more confident than at any other point since he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russian forces have retaken the initiative on the front line, while Ukraine is struggling amid flagging Western support and a shortage of troops.

Inside Russia, the election — and its predetermined outcome — underscored Mr. Putin’s dominance over the nation’s politics.

Mr. Kynev, the political scientist, said he believed many Russians were now in “shock,” because “restoring order has always been Vladimir Putin’s calling card.”

Mr. Putin’s early years in power were marked by terrorist attacks, culminating in the Beslan school siege in 2004; he used those violent episodes to justify his rollback of political freedoms. Before Friday, the most recent mass-casualty terrorist attack in the capital region was a suicide bombing at an airport in Moscow in 2011 that killed 37 people.

Still, given the Kremlin’s efficacy in cracking down on dissent and the news media, Mr. Kynev predicted that the political consequences of the concert hall attack would be limited, as long as the violence was not repeated.

“To be honest,” he said, “our society has gotten used to keeping quiet about inconvenient topics.”

Islamic State group (IS) has claimed the killing of ""at least 30"" soldiers in an ambush in Niger's western Tillaberi region on 20 March. The attack had prompted the government to declare three days of mourning.","IS issued the claim on 23 March on behalf of its Sahel Province branch, and through its Telegram channels.

A slightly more detailed report on the attack was issued via the same channels by IS's ""news agency"" Amaq. A screen caption indicated that the photo shown in the statement (above) was not related to the latest attack.

The Amaq statement claimed that ""at least 30"" Niger soldiers had been killed in an ambush targeting a military patrol on 20 March near the village of Teguey in Niger. Other soldiers were wounded, while the remainder fled, IS claimed.

The statement added that militants burnt eight military vehicles and seized an additional vehicle, along with weapons and ammunition.

Amaq boasted that Niger's government had declared three days mourning due to its ""major losses"".

A statement by Niger's Defence Minister said that troops were ambushed by around 100 jihadists, armed with bombs and bomb-rigged vehicles, between the villages of Teguey and Bankilare, during a counter-insurgency operation. He confirmed that around 30 troops were killed in the incident.

The IS statement said that the ambush was staged with ""various weapons"", making no mention of the possible use of booby-trapped vehicles or explosive devices.

Since Niger's July 2023 military coup, IS has claimed a number of major attacks in the west of the country.

Islamic State group's central media has finally issued a statement on the subject of the attack on a concert hall near Moscow on 22 March, for which the group's news outlet Amaq had earlier clamed responsibility.&#160;","In the latest statement from IS's central media outlet, issued on 23 March, the group did not attribute the attack to any of its global branches.

In the place where IS typically refers to the name of the responsible branch, it simply had the word ""Russia"", with no ""wilayah"" (branch) affiliation. (BBCM has highlighted this section in the image above.)

This is not uncommon. IS publishes such non-branch claims in countries where it does not regularly carry out attacks. This was the case with the Iran attacks in January 2024, where IS did not indicate the involvement of a regional branch and simply had the word ""Iran"" in the claim.

IS typically operates in Russia under the banner of its low-profile Caucuses Province branch. Many analysts and authorities have speculated that the Russia attack was orchestrated by IS's Afghanistan-focused Khorasan Province branch (ISKP or ISIS-K). The group has not linked the attack to either branch.

This could be deliberate, to avoid having any of its regional branches come under scrutiny and fire, or it could be because the attack was carried out by IS operatives not linked to these branches.&#160;

The latest statement did not offer a lot of new information nor indicated the fate of the four attackers.&#160;

But it did deliver a message of threat to Russia ""and its allies"".

It said, ""and let Crusader Russia and its allies know that the mujahidin do not forget their revenge"".

This is possibly a reference to Russia's involvement in military operations against IS in Syria, particularly in the central Homs province. It may also be a reference to past and recent Russian crackdowns on IS operatives in Russia and its republics.&#160;

IS issued the claim on 7 March through its weekly newspaper al-Naba (issue 433), via the messaging app Telegram.&#160;

It said that on 3 March, Mozambican armed forces tried to advance on IS positions in Quirimba Island, prompting clashes between the two sides that allegedly led to the killing of two soldiers.

Another two soldiers died drowning as they ""fled to their boats"" to escape the militants, according to al-Naba.

The remaining five, the IS mouthpiece continued, were captured and later shot dead by the jihadists.

The publication featured a picture to illustrate the execution-style killing of the five soldiers, four of whom were dressed in military fatigues, all sat on a beach.&#160;

Local media outlets said that ""at least"" eight soldiers were killed by militants in Quirimba ""since the occupation of the island on 2 March"".
