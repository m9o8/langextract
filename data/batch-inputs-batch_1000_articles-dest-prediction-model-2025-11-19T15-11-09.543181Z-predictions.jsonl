{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: But even as the judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, rejected the claim by one of Mr. Trump’s co-defendants, Mike Roman, that the relationship raised an actual conflict of interest by giving Ms. Willis a financial stake in the case, the judge also ruled that it raised “a significant appearance of impropriety.”\n\nThe judge gave her two choices: either Mr. Wade leaves her prosecution team, or she and her office must step aside from the case.\n\nHere are highlights from the 23-page ruling:\n\nA combination of factors raises a legitimate question.\n\nAlone, each of the two main issues raised by the defense — that Mr. Wade is being paid by the hour, and that two members of the prosecution team were having a relationship — would not be a problem. But combined, they raise an deeper issue, the judge wrote.\n\nFinancial gain was neither proven nor shown to be a motivating factor.\n\nThe judge wrote that Willis’s claim that she had reimbursed Mr. Wade in cash for trips they took together was “unusual” and “understandably concerning” but was “not so incredible as to be inherently unbelievable,” and the evidence did not establish that she had received any material benefit as a result of her decision to hire and engage in a romantic relationship with Mr. Wade.\n\nAnd, more important, the judge found, the evidence demonstrated that financial gain was “not a motivating factor” on Willis’s part in indicting and prosecuting the case.\n\nWillis showed a “tremendous lapse in judgment” and acted unprofessionally.\n\nWhile deciding that the evidence did not show there was an actual conflict of interest, the judge nevertheless suggested that the prosecutor’s conduct was problematic in a way that others — including an ethics commission and voters — may wish to address.\n\nThe situation still raises an “appearance of impropriety.”\n\nEven when no actual conflict exists, the judge wrote, “a perceived conflict in the reasonable eyes of the public threatens confidence in the legal system itself.” The combination of factors that made the question of whether Ms. Willis had a conflict legitimate, he wrote, means such an appearance of impropriety persists in the case.\n\nThe judge also wrote that “reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued resulting in some form of benefit to the District Attorney, or even whether the romantic relationship has resumed,” adding that, “As long as Wade remains on the case, this unnecessary perception will persist.”\n\nA lingering “odor of mendacity” means the two cannot continue together on the case.\n\nExpressing skepticism about testimony regarding when the relationship between Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade evolved into a romantic one, the judge portrayed the continued commingling of professional and personal relationships as untenable.\n\nThere has been no showing that the two prosecutors’ relationship violated the defendants’ rights or hurt them in any way, the judge wrote, and disqualifying Ms. Willis is unnecessary when there is a less drastic remedy available: Mr. Wade can leave the prosecution team.\n\nA gag order may be coming.\n\nThe defense had also asked the judge to disqualify Ms. Willis over public remarks she has made, including at a church in Atlanta on Jan. 14 in which she complained vaguely about her detractors and accused them of playing “the race card.” While finding that her comments did not amount to improperly trying the case in public, the judge nevertheless scolded her and suggested that he may soon issue a gag order to prevent further public comments.\n\nThe relationship is an unacceptable distraction.\n\nSumming up, the judge wrote that regardless of the outcome of the case, it is important that how it unfolds instills public confidence in the fairness and legitimacy of the process. While there is not a legal basis to support a finding that the district attorney has an actual conflict of interest, he found that the appearance of impropriety must nevertheless be addressed — signaling that Mr. Wade needs to leave the prosecution team in one manner or another.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.739849090576172,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":864,"startIndex":537,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":1662,"startIndex":1409,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":2190,"startIndex":1811,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":2816,"startIndex":2548,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":3263,"startIndex":2936,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":4044,"startIndex":3813,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":4350,"startIndex":4084,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"},{"endIndex":4899,"startIndex":4456,"uri":"https://manifold.markets/DanMan314/will-a-gag-order-be-issued-on-fani"},{"endIndex":5497,"startIndex":5043,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/highlights-of-the-judges-decision-in-the-georgia-trump-case/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Fulton County\n*   Atlanta"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-24.658641815185547}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.171178Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94daaq5Cpe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3452},"candidatesTokenCount":9,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":9}],"promptTokenCount":828,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":828}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1240,"totalTokenCount":2077,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:47.410444+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: “When people ask us whether it is OK for the United States to abandon Ukraine, the answer is no, because the world is operating not in a black-and-white way, or if you only look at one theater at a time,” he said. “The world is interconnected.”\n\nIf Russia is able to occupy more of Ukraine and claim victory, he added, “it would be seen as a victory of authoritarian states because Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, they are now linked together.”\n\nMr. Wu’s comments, made in a wide-ranging hourlong interview in Taipei, come as the Biden administration tries to get Congress to pass a supplemental funding package that would give $60 billion of aid to Ukraine.\n\nMany House Republicans are staunchly opposed to giving more aid to Ukraine, adopting the “America First” posture embraced by former President Donald J. Trump, a pro-Russia candidate who has pressed them to reject the package. For months they claimed they would be willing to consider providing more assistance for Kyiv if the Biden administration imposed severe immigration restrictions at the United States border with Mexico. But at Mr. Trump’s urging, they balked at a funding package that would have done that, calling the border measures too weak.\n\nThe package also includes $8 billion of aid to counter China in the Asia-Pacific region, $1.9 billion of which would refill stocks of U.S. weapons sent to Taiwan. And it includes $14.1 billion of military aid to Israel.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers contend that China is a bigger threat than Russia and that the funding proposed for Ukraine should go toward countering China. But other Republican officials in Congress and many Democrats make the same argument as Mr. Wu: that Taiwan’s security is linked to that of Ukraine, because China will see weakness on the part of the United States — and a greater chance of success in a potential invasion of Taiwan — if Ukraine is defeated.\n\nChinese leaders have said for decades that Taiwan, a de facto independent island, must be brought under the rule of the Communist Party, by force if necessary. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has continued to promote that position.\n\nThe U.S. and Taiwanese governments have been trying to deter China from notions of invading Taiwan, including through military buildup in the region and bolstering alliances with other democratic nations.\n\nIf the United States abandons Ukraine, Mr. Wu said, China will “take it as a hint” that if it can keep up sustained action against Taiwan, “the United States is going to back off, the United States and its allies are going to back off.” The thinking among Chinese officials would be this, he said: “OK, since Russia could do that, we can do that as well.”\n\n“So the U.S. determination in providing support to those countries suffering from authoritarian aggression, it is very important,” Mr. Wu said.\n\nAfter U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, China pushed propaganda through traditional state-run media and social media that “the U.S. commitment to anything is not firm,” Mr. Wu said. “We suffered from a huge wave of cognitive warfare.”\n\nChina has also spread disinformation stressing Russian narratives of the war, Mr. Wu said, including the idea that the expansion of NATO forced President Vladimir V. Putin to attack Ukraine, and that the United States is ultimately not committed to supporting Ukraine.\n\nOn the eve of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, and their two governments announced a “no limits” partnership.\n\nMr. Wu said some Central and Eastern European nations seeking to forge anti-authoritarian partnerships had strengthened their relations with Taiwan during the war.\n\nHis comments on the need for the United States to keep supporting Taiwan echo those of other senior Taiwanese officials. In May 2023, Bi-khim Hsiao, then Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States and now the incoming vice president, made similar arguments to reporters in Washington.\n\nAnd in February, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said during a visit of American lawmakers to Taiwan that the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the president-elect, Lai Ching-te, made clear to the lawmakers that “if for some reason the Ukrainians do not prevail, that will only encourage hostilities against Taiwan.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5190842701838567,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   United States\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   China\n*   North Korea\n*   Iran\n*   Taipei\n*   Asia-Pacific region\n*   Taiwan\n*   Israel\n*   Kyiv\n*   Mexico\n*   Afghanistan\n*   Beijing\n*   Central and Eastern European nations (or Central and Eastern Europe)\n*   Washington (referring to Washington D.C.)\n*   Illinois"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-53.984764099121094}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.859025Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4daZG3NOuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3637},"candidatesTokenCount":104,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":104}],"promptTokenCount":919,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":919}],"thoughtsTokenCount":529,"totalTokenCount":1552,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:47.849361+00:00"}

Ismail said leaving politics was difficult as he had been affiliated with Imran Khan (PTI founder) since 1993. He added after leaving politics, he has been focusing on his business and family.\n\nResponding to a question on whether he would go back to the PTI, Ismail said political conditions are very difficult for the party at the moment and several of its members are in jail. He added he does not know who is managing the party right now, so he will think about it later, but he is currently not planning on returning to politics.\n\nIsmail said he believes the PTI is a good political party and not a \"terrorist party\". He added it is a party which stands with the military and other institutions like the judiciary. He claimed no government in Pakistan can work \"without the support of institutions\", and as long as the PTI was in power, it enjoyed full support from the Army and other institutions of the military. He remarked it is very encouraging for a government to \"remain on the same page as the military\".\n\nIsmail mentioned after a vote of no-confidence against the PTI government in the centre, he resigned from the governorship of Sindh because he felt he could not get along with the new government. He was of the view that former president Arif Alvi should also have resigned if he was \"unable to work freely\".\n\nIsmail strongly condemned an alleged negative social media campaign against military personnel martyred a few days back and called the people involved in it \"criminals of the nation\". He said he decided to leave the PTI after the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of Imran Khan).\n\nMirza asked senior journalist Muhammad Malick about politicians in the PTI feeling that the party has been \"hijacked by lawyers\". Malick said Khan gave party tickets to a large number of lawyers before elections, thinking that lawyers would not be disqualified and the courts would also be lenient towards them. He noted the PTI stands divided into four to five factions at the moment as there is a \"communication gap\" between the party and Khan since he is in jail.\n\nMalick was of the view that the issue of reserved seats is not important because the PTI will not be able to form its government even if it gets those seats in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament). He remarked the issue is between two individuals: Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir. He added if these two individuals \"take two steps back and reach big decisions\", things would become better for the PTI. He predicted some relief would gradually be given to the PTI, but not to Khan.\n\nTalking about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur's meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Malick said it should not be seen as \"defiance\" to Khan. He added the two would continue to meet in future as well because they are constitutional office holders.\n\nSource: Dawn News TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1700 GMT 17 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.0502743928328804,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Pakistan\n*   Sindh\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-70.15631103515625}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.041749Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daZXGArH1x_AP3YWuoAQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2781},"candidatesTokenCount":23,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":23}],"promptTokenCount":711,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":711}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1208,"totalTokenCount":1942,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.909457+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: El 25 de marzo de 2024, nubes carmesí, esmeralda, añil y azafrán se ciernen sobre el país para celebrar una de sus fiestas más vibrantes, alegres y coloridas.\n\n“Jugar al Holi”, como dicen los indios, se ha extendido mucho más allá de las fronteras de India.\n\nEl jolgorio comienza al atardecer\n\nTambién conocido como el “festival de los colores”, el Holi (que se pronuncia como santo en inglés, holy, con una hache inicial aspirada), comienza la noche de luna llena del mes phalguna del calendario hindú, que cae alrededor de febrero o marzo.\n\nLa celebración comienza con el encendido de las hogueras. La gente se reúne en torno a las llamas para cantar, bailar y rezar durante un ritual nocturno llamado Holika Dahan, que recrea la desaparición de Holika, una demonio hindú mítica.\n\nSe arrojan al fuego todo tipo de cosas, como leña, hojas y comida, en una purga simbólica del mal y el triunfo del bien.\n\nArchie Singhal, de 24 años, va de Delhi a visitar a su familia en Gujarat la víspera del Holi, cuando se enciende el fuego por la noche. A la mañana siguiente, Singhal se prepara para las ráfagas de polvo, llamadas gulal, aplicándose aceite en el cuerpo para que los colores no se le peguen a la piel. También se pone ropa vieja que no le importa descartar.\n\n¿Por qué los colores?\n\nLas raíces del Holi se encuentran en el hinduismo. El dios Krishna, maldecido por un demonio de piel azul, se quejó con su madre preguntándole por qué Radha, su amada, era de piel clara y él no. Su madre, Yashoda, le sugiere juguetonamente que pinte la cara de Radha con los colores que desee. Entonces Krishna la pinta de colores para que ambos se parezcan.\n\nEl Holi es, en parte, una celebración del amor entre Krishna y Radha, que va más allá de las diferencias. Hoy en día, parte del gulal que se utiliza durante la festividad es sintético. Pero tradicionalmente los colores proceden de ingredientes naturales, como flores secas, cúrcuma, hojas secas, uvas, bayas, betabel y té.\n\n“Hay un ambiente de libertad”, dijo Singhal, y añadió que ella no duda en lanzar colores sobre su hermano menor, sus padres, sus tíos y sus vecinos.\n\nTodo el mundo participa\n\nLa antigua fiesta hindú evita las divisiones religiosas, sociales, políticas y de casta que apuntalan a menudo la sectaria sociedad india. Hindú o no, cualquiera puede ser salpicado con polvo de colores brillantes, o incluso con huevos y cerveza.\n\nAlgunos participan en el culto, llamado puja, ofreciendo plegarias a los dioses. Para otros, el Holi es una celebración de la comunidad. El festival involucra a todo el mundo, incluidos a los incautos transeúntes.\n\n“La gente olvida sus malentendidos o enemistades durante esta ocasión y vuelven a ser amigos”, dice Ratikanta Singh, de 63 años, quien a veces escribe sobre Holi, en Assam, en el noreste de India.\n\nEl banquete\n\nCuando no están lanzando gulal, amigos, familiares y vecinos participan en un bufé de platos y bebidas tradicionales. Entre ellos, gujiya, unos dulces fritos rellenos de frutos secos; dahi vada, unos buñuelos de lentejas fritos servidos con yogur; y kanji, bebida tradicional elaborada con zanahorias fermentadas en agua y especias.\n\nAlgunos celebran el Holi con thandai, un brebaje de leche verde claro, pétalos de rosa, cardamomo, almendras, semillas de hinojo y otros ingredientes. Desde hace miles de años, la bebida se adereza a veces con bhang, u hojas de marihuana trituradas, que contribuyen al ambiente de juerga.\n\nEl Holi tiene raíces ancestrales\n\nLa festividad está documentada desde hace siglos en textos hindúes. La tradición es observada por jóvenes y mayores, sobre todo en el norte de India y Nepal, donde se origina la mitología del festival.\n\nEl Holi también marca el inicio de las cosechas con la llegada de la primavera en India, donde más de la mitad de la población vive en zonas rurales.\n\nLas tradiciones varían según el país\n\nLas celebraciones del Holi son tan diversas como el subcontinente indio. Son especialmente intensas en el norte de India, considerado el lugar de nacimiento del dios hindú Krishna, donde los festejos pueden durar más de una semana.\n\nEn Mathura, ciudad del norte donde se dice que nació Krishna, la gente recrea un relato hindú en el que Krishna visita a Radha para enamorarla y los amigos vaqueros de ella, ofendidos por sus insinuaciones, lo expulsan con palos.\n\nEn el estado oriental de Odisha se celebra un festival de un día de duración llamado Dola Purnima. Las grandes procesiones de gente que cargan al hombro carruajes ricamente decorados con estatuas de dioses hindúes son una parte importante de las festividades. Las procesiones están llenas del sonido de tambores, canciones, polvos de colores y pétalos de flores que se lanzan al aire.\n\nEn el sur de India, donde el Holi no se celebra tan ampliamente, muchos templos llevan a cabo ritos religiosos. En la comunidad tribal de Kudumbi, en el suroeste, los devotos de los templos cortan palmas de areca y transportan sus troncos al santuario en un ritual que simboliza la victoria del bien sobre el mal.\n\nNo solo se celebra en India\n\nHoli se celebra en todo el mundo en donde haya ido la diáspora india. Más de 32 millones de indios y personas de origen indio están en el extranjero, la mayoría en Estados Unidos, donde residen 4,4 millones, según el gobierno indio.\n\nTambién se disfruta mucho en países tan variados como Fiyi, Mauricio, Sudáfrica, el Reino Unido y otras partes de Europa.\n\nEl Holi se conoce como Phagwa en las comunidades indias del Caribe, como Guyana, Surinam y Trinidad y Tobago.\n\nEl gobierno indio también ha utilizado el festival para proyectar poder blando y rediseñar su imagen como parte de su campaña turística “India increíble”.\n\nDurante el festival, “el mundo es una aldea global”, dijo Shubham Sachdeva, de 29 años, vecino de un suburbio del este de Delhi, quien añadió que sus amigos de Estados Unidos celebraban Holi con sus compañeros de piso, fueran o no indios. “Todo esto acerca el mundo a los demás”.\n\nJohn Yoon es un reportero del Times afincado en Seúl que cubre noticias de última hora y de tendencia.

Stoltenberg underscored that the Nordic country “now enjoys the protection granted under Article 5, the ultimate guarantee of allies’ freedom and security.”\n\nArticle 5 of NATO’s treaty obliges all members to come to the aid of an ally whose territory or security is under threat. It has only been activated once – by the U.S. after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks – and is the collective security guarantee that Sweden has sought since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer and the whole alliance more secure,” Stoltenberg said. He added that the move “demonstrates that NATO’s door remains open and that every nation has the right to choose its own path.”\n\nSweden, along with Finland, which joined NATO last year, both abandoned the long-standing military neutrality that was a hallmark of the Nordic states’ Cold War foreign policy after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.\n\nBiden, in his speech to Congress, stepped up calls for reluctant Republicans to approve stalled military assistance to Ukraine as the war enters its third year.\n\n“If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not,\" Biden said. “But Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons it needs to defend itself.”\n\nBiden and his NATO counterparts have vowed that Ukraine will join NATO one day, too.\n\nSweden’s membership had been held up due to objections by NATO members Turkey and Hungary. Turkey expressed concern that Sweden was harboring and not taking enough action against Kurdish groups that it regards as terrorists, and Hungary's populist President Viktor Orban has shown pro-Russian sentiment and not shared the alliance’s determination to support Ukraine.\n\nAfter months of delay, Turkey ratified Sweden’s admission earlier this year, and Hungary did so this week.\n\n___\n\nCook reported from Brussels.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Mersal, who was then a graduate student, thought the author might be related to a novelist and prominent anticolonial figure, Latifa al-Zayyat. She bought the book for one Egyptian pound.\n\nWhat Mersal found instead was an intimate, introspective novel, an essential but largely forgotten work by a female writer in early contemporary Egypt. The voice, Mersal later wrote, was “modern, strange, limpid and beyond categorization.”\n\nThe book moved her, she said, and set her on a nearly 30-year journey to learn what she could about the author, a young Egyptian woman called Enayat al-Zayyat who died by suicide in 1963 after overdosing on pills. All she left was a note by her bed for her son, Abbas, that read: “I do love you, it’s just that life is unbearable. Forgive me.” After her death, her writing fell into oblivion.\n\nIn “Traces of Enayat,” translated by Robin Moger and to be published on April 2 in the United States by Transit Books, Mersal revives the story of the late writer. The Arabic version, published in 2019, won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award two years later and was a regional success. A mix of literary genres, the book is a subtle and universal exploration of identity.\n\n“A sense of longing for a place and a self that has left you comes through in the pages,” Adam Levy, the book’s U.S. editor, said.\n\nThe book feels like a biography, he said, but it is more ambitious, and more interesting, than that. “As you read,” he added, “you start to feel Iman’s presence in it subtly.”\n\nMersal, who is now 57 and one of the most consequential Egyptian authors of her generation, grew up in Mit Adlan, a village in the delta of the Nile, in northern Egypt. As a child, she loved language and songs, often shutting herself in her room to listen to music, plays and narrated movies on the radio.\n\nShe lost her mother at a young age, and wrote her first poem, a critique of Mother’s Day that started with the phrase “against motherhood,” when she was in fifth grade. She wrote it in anger, she said, and read it out loud during a celebration in the school courtyard.\n\n“One of the toughest teachers cried,” said Mersal, who has two sons. “I call myself a writer since.”\n\nAl-Zayyat came of age during a golden era for Egyptian literature, in the 1950s and 1960s, during Gamal Abdel Nasser’s government. Many influential writers in that era were driven by the urge to transform society. Mersal, too, socialized with writers who wanted to change the world, and joined a feminist publication, “Bint al Ard,” in 1986. But she wasn’t sure what kind of intellectual she wanted to become.\n\n“The literary scene was controlled by the old guard who believed in Arab nationalism or communism, who believed that literature can change the status quo,” she said. “I was thinking about figuring out my own voice. Expressing my relationship with my father, my relationship with Cairo, my city. It was about individuality.”\n\nIn 1992, she visited Baghdad to meet with women affected by the Gulf War in Iraq and the brutality of the regime in their own country. It was then that Mersal started questioning her purpose.\n\n“It was transformative. I faced many questions,” said Mersal during an interview from her work studio in Edmonton, Alberta, where she lives. “What does Arab nationalism mean, what does it mean to be a committed writer?”\n\nNew perspectives opened up when she discovered “Love and Silence,” another woman’s honest chronicle of suffering and self-discovery. The book, which came out four years after al-Zayyat’s death, tells the story of Najla, a young woman who is grieving the recent loss of her brother and figuring out her place in a fraught political context. The narrator’s unfiltered voice sketches Najla’s attempts at finding herself, failing brutally each time.\n\nThough al-Zayyat’s book had its flaws, Mersal said, it was life-altering. Mersal had been facing depression and searching for meaning in her life, she said. “This book spoke to me in a way no other female writer spoke to me.”\n\nMersal moved to the United States in 1998 and later to Canada, where she has lived since as an academic, poet, translator and author. Al-Zayyat grew up in a very different world, among the high society of Cairo.\n\nOver the years, Mersal took her time to carefully navigate al-Zayyat’s world. She includes this journey in her book, taking the reader to places few can access, such as a meeting with al-Zayyat’s childhood friend, the iconic Egyptian actress Nadia Lutfi.\n\nAl-Zayyat grew up in a loving family and was particularly close to her father, but struggled with depression most of her life. She had a passion for drawing and painting but stopped studying before she turned 19 to marry a man from an affluent family. The marriage was agonizing, and soon ended in a bitter divorce.\n\nIn Mersal’s book, an entry from al-Zayyat’s journal dated 1962 captured her pain. “I don’t mean a thing to anybody. Lost, found, it’s all the same: Here is as good as gone. The world wouldn’t tremble either way. When I walk I leave no tracks, like I walk on water, and I am unseen, invisible.”\n\nWhat led al-Zayyat to end her life is uncertain. A commercial film and a radio series were made based on her novel. Both disappointed Mersal and al-Zayyat’s niece. They felt that, among other issues, the productions had erased the substance of the novel and focused on elements of the plot.\n\nDuring her last months, al-Zayyat lived in an apartment that her father built for her on the second floor of their villa in Dokki, then a wealthy residential suburb of Cairo. She wrote on a newly-acquired Optima typewriter, and was committed to getting her book published. At the same time, she was losing custody of her son in court.\n\nAfter her mother received a call from the publishing house saying that the manuscript had been rejected, al-Zayyat chopped off her hair and locked herself in the apartment. According to Mersal, who spoke to the author’s sister and to her best friend, she was found dead the next day.\n\nIt seemed that being part of the upper class limited her possibilities, Mersal explained — as if society had disappointed her so much that death was the only form of protest that remained.\n\n“The idea that a young woman would kill herself — a young woman with a son, a father and a best friend — and all because of a book, was genuinely tragic, but it was also seductive in its tragedy,” Mersal wrote in the book. “I pictured Enayat painstakingly acquiring the rudiments of good Arabic grammar and inflection, then carefully setting down everything she wanted to say in her novel, then refusing the suggestion that she should self-publish.”\n\nMersal had many questions that she attempted to answer over her long years of obsessive research, but her intent never was to write a biography or a history book, she said.\n\n“Telling the story of searching for Enayat was my way of reading her life and not displaying her life,” she said. “My dream was to tell our story, my story, her story, this interaction between us. The past is not that glorious. It’s the collective and individual wounds of this past.”\n\nWhen Mersal finished writing the book, she struggled with emptiness and sadness that echoed al-Zayyat’s.\n\n“It felt like a friend died,” she said. “It was a weird feeling of mourning.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7921105879771558,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Egypt\n*   United States\n*   Mit Adlan (a village in the delta of the Nile)\n*   Nile (delta of the Nile)\n*   Cairo\n*   Baghdad\n*   Iraq\n*   Edmonton, Alberta\n*   Canada\n*   Dokki (a suburb of Cairo)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-62.57673645019531}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.668743Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4dacfoKJe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6038},"candidatesTokenCount":79,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":79}],"promptTokenCount":1710,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1710}],"thoughtsTokenCount":932,"totalTokenCount":2721,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.463963+00:00"}

Responding to questions from lawmakers in parliament, the minister said India has also informed the Maldives that its navy had boarded the vessels because they had had satellite phones and that they had believed it was illegal. The minister said while the use of satellite phones in Indian waters was banned after an amendment to certain Indian regulations, it was mandatory under Maldivian regulations to have one, especially if the vessels venture outside a certain distance. Responding to a question by Member of Parliament for Hulhumale, Ali Niyaz, on whether the minister believed in the response, the minister said he believed it had been a miscommunication, and that the Maldivian Chief of Defence Force, who had been in India on an official visit at the time, had also been informed by senior policy-level Indian officials of the same. The minister, however, said there are various established channels between neighbouring countries to provide information to each other when such operations are undertaken on the seas, but that it was surprising that no information had been shared on the operation undertaken where the Indian Navy had boarded the Maldivian vessels. The minister also confirmed that the Maldivian vessels had been inside Maldivian waters prior to and when the operation was conducted and had not ventured into Indian waters. He added that future measures will include increased coordination between all countries and establish a mechanism to work together, as well as increase the capability within the Maldives to monitor its own borders, which the government has already started.

Also, all kind of dispersion of aircraft is good and this allows to add depth to our defence activities,\" Rebo said.\n\nSweden also contributes to Nato with advance warning systems. They also have significant intelligence capability and defence industry.\n\n\"Sweden is allegedly one of the few European states that produces military platforms in all military dimensions and for all weapon types. There are supposedly only four such states in Europe. Besides Sweden, also the United Kingdom, France and Germany. These are also historically very deep and long-term and technologically advanced solutions,\" Kolga said.\n\nBut Sweden&#8217;s land force has decreased in the past decade. According to Hurt, after the Cold War it focused on expedition forces and field operations.\n\n\"When Sweden&#8217;s defence forces began to be strengthened after Crimea&#8217;s occupation in 2014 and the start of Russia&#8217;s aggression against Ukraine, then clearly too little money was allocated for that, hence this defence capability is certainly in a developmental stage,\" he said.\n\n\"If we look at Sweden&#8217;s 12-billion annual budget then this allows them develop very fast in the future. Especially because they have in industrial base,\" Rebo noted.\n\nEven though Nato&#8217;s Baltic Sea puzzle is now ready, there is still the outstanding question of how well various pieces fit together. The military command and planning of the alliance has been divided between different joint force commands. Denmark and Finland are under Brunssum in the Netherlands, while Norway is under US-based Norfolk. Now Sweden is also looking to the USA. This has led to a fear that the Baltic states will remain on the border of two commands and planning.\n\n\"Sweden is partly a Baltic Sea state but partly also an Arctic state and it is looking towards the north, and historically has always done so. Sweden has somewhat different interests than Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The decisions about where those borders will be drawn between different Nato joint force commands, have not been made yet,\" said Hurt.\n\nThis border is an imaginary border, which can be coordinated and about which either additional plans can be developed, or partial plans with which Sweden can also support the Baltic states,\" Rebo said.\n\nAccording to Rebo, it is obvious that with Sweden&#8217;s membership, Nato&#8217;s defence activities will become more effective and that this will also reduce the Russian threat.\n\n\"If we speak about Kaliningrad, then from the Russian perspective their chances of success on the sea and in skies will decrease, which means that the defence of the Suwalki gap will be an increasingly important issue for our southern neighbours,\" Rebo said.\n\n\"Supplying Kaliningrad is complicated already in peacetime, but in a time of war it will become even clearer that Sweden would not passively observe when Russia is trying to supply Kaliningrad,\" Hurt said.\n\nAccording to Hurt, no military-technical revolution will take place in Sweden upon accession to Nato.\n\n\"Rather this is about changing the mindsets of people, which is important and will certainly take years. Until now, Sweden has gotten used to being outside alliances, which means that for a long time it has assumed that it will remain outside military conflicts,\" Hurt said.\n\n(See the original here.)\n\nSource: ERR News website, Tallinn, in Estonian 1922 GMT 3 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.3994928661145662,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Sweden\n*   Baltic Sea\n*   Baltic states\n*   Estonia\n*   Gotland island\n*   Iceland\n*   Atlantic (referring to the Atlantic Ocean)\n*   North Atlantic\n*   Europe\n*   United Kingdom\n*   France\n*   Germany\n*   Crimea\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Denmark\n*   Finland\n*   Brunssum (Netherlands)\n*   Netherlands\n*   Norway\n*   USA\n*   Norfolk (USA)\n*   Arctic\n*   Latvia\n*   Lithuania\n*   Kaliningrad\n*   Suwalki gap\n*   Tallinn"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-60.72291564941406}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.159637Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4daZXfCZ3y1PIPxO6p0Qc","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4274},"candidatesTokenCount":152,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":152}],"promptTokenCount":1098,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1098}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2180,"totalTokenCount":3430,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:48.686463+00:00"}

Condemning the Moscow attack, the Taliban have called on the region to coordinate efforts against IS.\n\nSpeaking to Afghan Shamshad TV's Tawda Bahsona (Heated Discussions) talk show on 24 March, a Kabul-based analyst, Habibullah Janebdar reiterated the Taliban stance on the region's coordination, criticising regional countries for failing to recognise the ruling group and engaging in \"proper\" interaction with it.\n\n\"If there was coordination, such incidents would not have happened,\" he told Shamshad. \"Neighbouring countries should learn a good lesson from such incidents and engage in full interaction with Afghanistan if they really want to work for peace for their citizens.\"\n\nJanebdar lauded the Taliban fight against IS over the past three years of their return to power, saying that the group is preventing the threat to regional countries for free.&#160;\n\nAsked what assistance Russia should provide to the Taliban in the fight against IS, Janebdar put recognition of the ruling group as the first step that Moscow should take followed by encouraging Russian investments in the country, saying that internal shortcomings of the Taliban should be set aside.\n\nWhen asked about Russia's recent hosting of anti-Taliban figures' conference, he advised Moscow to \"learn a lesson from its past\" in Afghanistan, saying: \"Those pursuing good relations with Afghanistan make a gain, and those pursuing the policy of expansionism towards Afghanistan, be that the then policy of the Great Britain or tsarist Russia, have made a loss\".\n\nAnother analyst from Moscow, Yahya Chaosh, accused France and the US of being behind the Moscow assault, which according to him was carried out by Tajik nationals, saying that Paris is \"practically at war with Russia\".\n\nAccording to him, France has established close ties with Tajikistan through \"fugitive\" anti-Taliban former Afghan government officials, who he alleged have allied with IS's Khorasan branch to fight the Taliban.\n\nAsked what are the objectives behind the attacks in Kandahar and Moscow, Chaosh described IS as a \"common enemy created by Western intelligence to gain common interests in Afghanistan, Russia and other countries which oppose the policies of the United States of America\".\n\nAsked how regional countries would be able to fend off the IS threat, Chaosh stressed the need for intelligence cooperation between regional countries, including Afghanistan, saying he believed that \"after his re-election, Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to have very close relations with Afghanistan\".\n\nAnother commentator, the US-based university lecturer Samsor Safi said: \"I would like to condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Kandahar and Moscow.\" He alleged that Tajikistan and Pakistan were involved in orchestrating both the Kandahar and Moscow attacks, suggesting that these assaults were conducted under the \"direction of the West\".

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The former president, Juan Orlando Hernández, has been on trial for two weeks in Federal District Court, facing charges that he conspired to import cocaine into the United States. Prosecutors said that he worked with ruthless drug gangs like the Sinaloa Cartel, led by the Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzman Loera, better known as El Chapo.\n\nGovernment witnesses have included a string of former traffickers from Honduras who testified that they bribed Mr. Hernández in return for promises that he would insulate them from investigations and protect them from extradition to the United States.\n\nDressed in a dark suit with a blue shirt and tie, Mr. Hernández sat up straight during his testimony and sometimes gave long, discursive answers that prompted the judge overseeing the trial to rein him in.\n\nAt other times his answers were terse.\n\n“Did you ever receive a bribe from El Chapo?” one of Mr. Hernández’s lawyers asked at one point.\n\n“Never,” Mr. Hernández replied.\n\nHe gave the same answer to successive questions about whether he had ever met El Chapo, his traffickers or anyone purporting to be a member of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nWhen one of his lawyers asked if he had promised cartels that he would protect them, Mr. Hernández answered: “On the contrary, sir. The problem was that we were going to terminate them.”\n\nThroughout the trial, rows of benches in the courtroom have been filled with Hondurans attending to watch Mr. Hernández face a judicial process of the sort some doubted could have taken place in Honduras. Those who could not find a seat in the courtroom have instead watched the proceedings on a tall screen in an overflow room on a different floor of the courthouse.\n\nDuring Mr. Hernández’s direct testimony on Tuesday, some in the courtroom gallery were rapt. At times others laughed derisively, and on one occasion a statement by Mr. Hernández was met with a long hiss.\n\nIt is almost always considered risky for a criminal defendant to testify because friendly questions from a defense lawyer are typically followed by a pointed cross-examination from prosecutors.\n\nSome defendants decide to testify because they believe they can sway jurors; others may choose to take the stand when they feel that the tide of a trial is going against them and they have little to lose.\n\nWhile cross-examining Mr. Hernández on Tuesday afternoon, a prosecutor asked him why various accused traffickers whose extradition had been requested by the United States had not been handed over while he was president. Mr. Hernández replied that his administration had referred all extradition requests to the Honduran Supreme Court.\n\nLater, the prosecutor asked Mr. Hernández about a photograph taken during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that showed him with a man named Miguel Arnulfo Valle Valle, who was a leader of a violent drug gang. Mr. Hernández replied that he believed the picture had been the subject of a debate over whether it was fake or a “photomontage.”\n\n“The person with his arm around you is Arnulfo Valle?” the prosecutor asked.\n\nMr. Hernández replied: “Sir, I don’t know Mr. Arnulfo Valle.”\n\nDuring his political career as a member of the right-wing Honduran National Party, Mr. Hernández was seen as adept at accumulating power and willing to use it, sometimes bluntly.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court threw out laws he had pushed through while serving as president of the Honduran Congress, the Congress simply replaced four justices. Later, the Supreme Court changed rules to allow Mr. Hernández to serve a second term as president of Honduras.\n\nPolitical opponents claimed that both the presidential contests that Mr. Hernández won, in 2013 and 2017, were marred by fraud. Prosecutors in New York said that he financed both with drug money. Distrust of the 2017 election results led to protests that blocked roads and bridges.\n\nProsecutors said that Mr. Hernández gave money to a political party colleague who paid gang members to commit violence, and that demonstrators died during confrontations with security forces that followed.\n\nBy the time his second term ended, Mr. Hernández was deeply unpopular. His administration had failed to curb crime or create a healthy economy, which led in part to migration from Honduras. His successor as president, Xiomara Castro, accused Mr. Hernández of having turned the country into a “narco-dictatorship.” Thousands of Hondurans celebrated when he was extradited to New York.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Hernández portrayed himself as a stalwart partner of U.S. officials in their fight to stem the flow of drugs over the country’s southern border. He said that he had several meetings about that with U.S. officials, including Gen. John Kelly, then the commander of the U.S. Army Southern Command.\n\n“I asked General Kelly to help us in our fight against drug trafficking,” Mr. Hernández said, adding: “The Southern Command helped us set up an elite force that we called the Tigers.”\n\nAs Mr. Hernández was being cross-examined, spectators in the overflow room were more animated than those who had watched in the courtroom. At times laughter echoed in the room, including when Mr. Hernández professed puzzlement over the World Cup photo that showed him with Mr. Valle.\n\nAfter the court session ended, Mr. Hernández buttoned his suit jacket, rose from the witness stand and was led by a federal marshal back to the seat at the defense table that he had occupied since the trial began.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.063367124463691,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":903,"startIndex":544,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/06/ex-president-of-honduras-denies-at-trial-that-he-trafficked-drugs/"},{"endIndex":4845,"startIndex":964,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":5596,"startIndex":4868,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":6718,"startIndex":5989,"title":"Your prompt"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Federal District Court\n*   United States\n*   Mexico (implied by \"Mexican drug lord\")\n*   Honduras\n*   courtroom\n*   overflow room\n*   courthouse\n*   courtroom gallery\n*   Honduran Supreme Court\n*   South Africa\n*   Honduran Congress\n*   New York\n*   southern border (referring to the U.S. southern border)\n*   Southern Command (U.S. Army Southern Command, which operates in a specific geographic region)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-129.7307891845703}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.968887Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94dabeRO_iE_NUP9MeB6AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4559},"candidatesTokenCount":122,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":122}],"promptTokenCount":1137,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1137}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1987,"totalTokenCount":3246,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:51.615101+00:00"}

Moreover, for Russia to attack a NATO member state, a number of preconditions must be met and a specific situation must be created. The NBS therefore draws attention to the fact that such preconditions do not exist for Russian aggression against NATO members.\n\nThe NBS reminds that Latvia has been a member of the world's strongest alliance for almost 20 years. An attack on Latvia would mean an attack on all member states, followed by an immediate response from NATO.\n\nRecently, populist speculations about the inability of the NBS to defend the country have been expressed in the Latvian information space by various Latvian and foreign voices. Therefore, the NBS calls on the public to maintain a cool head, not to share or amplify such messages - especially those disseminated by persons who are no longer serving in the armed forces, or who have not been involved in the defence sector at all. By sharing questionable messages, these individuals are unwittingly or knowingly doing a service to Russia's aggressive propaganda messages.\n\n\"We, soldiers and servicemen, do not take peace for granted. Like the Lithuanians and Estonians and the soldiers of other NATO member states, we prepare for war every day so that it does not happen. This is our chosen vocation and duty towards Latvia and our responsibility for every resident of our country. Instead of propagating populist posts on social media, we invite everyone to strengthen national security by joining the National Guard, the National Defence Service, or by learning basic military skills in the Volunteer Reservist Course,\" reads the NBS statement.\n\nIn conclusion, the NBS underlines that the security situation in Latvia is as stable and comparable to the security situation in other NATO member states not bordering Russia, such as Spain, France or Italy.\n\nSource: LETA website, Riga, in English 0640 gmt 6 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6634797882615474,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1269,"startIndex":1020,"uri":"https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.03.2024-latvian-armed-forces-urge-public-not-to-share-dubious-information.a545625/"},{"endIndex":2926,"startIndex":2641,"uri":"https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.03.2024-latvian-armed-forces-urge-public-not-to-share-dubious-information.a545625/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Europe\n*   Latvia\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Lithuania (implied by \"Lithuanians\")\n*   Estonia (implied by \"Estonians\")\n*   Spain\n*   France\n*   Italy\n*   Riga"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-37.8183479309082}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.540975Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daa-CIcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2143},"candidatesTokenCount":57,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":57}],"promptTokenCount":503,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":503}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1034,"totalTokenCount":1594,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.625454+00:00"}

Retirement benefits include a bulk payment at the outset, based on 15 years of service, as well as 75% of their monthly salaries at the time of retirement paid monthly for life. The regulation also allows for a current employee, who is appointed as a member of the commission, to be eligible for retirement benefits, if they have served the commission for a total of at least 10 years (as an employee and a commission member cumulatively).

The court, in its ruling, said Ahmed had entered a contract (in 2018) to construct three classrooms in Kandoodhoo School in Thaa Atoll and made a verbal agreement with Haleel to implement the project in 2018. The contract was valued at 1.2m rufiyaa ($84,306), of which Ahmed had paid 425,000 rufiyaa ($27,567). The Civil Court issued the ruling in absentia as Ahmed had failed to appear in court or responded to the court, after accepting the summons. Ahmed is currently campaigning for the upcoming parliament election in his current constituency, on a ticket from opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). Under the constitution, a decreed debt and failure to pay the debt will result in the lawmaker not meeting the conditions required to be a member of parliament. As such, if Ahmed fails to pay the outstanding within 15 days of the ruling, his seat may be at risk.

Many vessels depart from the port to ship grain and other agricultural products across the Black Sea.\n\nBut for past six months, Russia has been targeting grain silos and naval infrastructure with drones and missiles. “They are trying to attack and destroy the potential of a country that is at war and is trying to rebuild its economy to support the front,” Ms. Humeniuk said.\n\nThe attacks have also caused civilian casualties, either from direct targeting or falling debris.

He also registered his candidacy in the 2021 and 2024 presidential elections, but was disqualified by the hardline vetting body, the Guardian Council.\n\nThe state broadcaster-run daily Jaam-e Jam newspaper said \"With Larijani's appointment and the formation of the Defence Council, Iran has unveiled a new security and defence arrangement.\"\n\nConservative daily Farhikhtegan said \"Larijani's return to the SNSC after 20 years signals a reconstruction of national affairs with a centrist approach\".\n\nThe paper in a separate op-ed said \"Larijani 3.0 must rebuild national unity from a centrist stance - neither the hardliner of the past nor the reformist ally of the Rouhani era\".\n\nThe reformist Sazandegi said Larijani's return could mean \"a shift from maximalist resistance to greater rationality in security policymaking\".\n\nOn X, Larijani's appointment was either welcomed or tacitly accepted by users from across the political spectrum.\n\nSome users said the appointment signified changes in strategies of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, echoing recent speculation and chatter on upcoming senior staffing changes.\n\nOthers highlighted his nonpartisan nature and perceived \"moderate approach\", expecting a \"positive change\" in the top security body.\n\nSome users described Larijani as a critic of hardliners, saying that a shift towards a more moderate approach was desperately needed in the current situation.\n\nMeanwhile, some hardline figures sought to warn Larijani that he must adhere to Iran's conservative policies, especially in foreign policy especially towards the US and Trump's mounting pressure on Iran.\n\nHardline MP Amir Hossein Sabeti suggested Larijani was appointed to compensate for Pezeshkian's weaknesses.\n\nPublic offices closed in most provinces amid heat, energy crisis\n\nPublic offices in more Iranian provinces will be closed today.

The report said he travelled to Vienna and met Mossad officers on five occasions.\n\nMizan also added that Vadi had provided Mossad with information about one of the Iranian nuclear scientists assassinated during the 12-day military campaign by Israel, which included targeting of top commanders and nuclear scientists.\n\nOn the case of the alleged IS member, Mizan said a \"terrorist cell's safehouse was identified before any attack could take place\" and that security forces \"killed four terrorists in an armed clash\" while raiding the house, while Asgharzadeh managed to flee and was later arrested.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.989618377685547,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Iran\n*   US\n*   Vienna\n*   Israel"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-49.74045944213867}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.434145Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"at4daeG_GuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3829},"candidatesTokenCount":25,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":25}],"promptTokenCount":948,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":948}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1463,"totalTokenCount":2436,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:52.332371+00:00"}

The seven nations started accession negotiations soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and eventually were invited to join at the Prague Summit in November 2002. Another group of former Soviet satellites including Poland and the Czech Republic had been admitted several years earlier.\n\nSince joining the alliance, these countries often warned about the threat of Russia, using their national trauma of Soviet occupation as proof of credibility. While Western nations often dismissed their sometimes hawkish attitude, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is seen as a vindication of those fears. They have given some of the most robust responses, helping Ukraine with equipment and money, and pushing for even greater sanctions on Russia.\n\nMost of the former Soviet Republics that joined NATO at the turn of the millennium spend more than the required 2% of gross domestic product on defense.

Rome is in her district, in a deeply conservative area in the northwestern part of the state.\n\nMr. Biden, for his part, assailed Mr. Trump at his rally in Atlanta over his alliance with Ms. Greene and his hosting of Viktor Orban on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida. Mr. Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has been widely condemned for his attacks on democratic norms.\n\n“It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with,” Mr. Biden said, adding of Mr. Trump: “When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him.”\n\nIn the meantime, the president continues to face anger over his handling of the war in Gaza. At the event on Saturday, a pro-Palestine protester shouted over the president a few minutes into his speech before being removed.\n\nMr. Biden acknowledged the discontent during his interview with MSNBC, criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for the rising civilian death toll but saying that there was “no red line” for Israel that would prompt the United States to “cut off all weapons so they don’t have the iron dome to protect them.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.701746114095052,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Georgia\n*   southern border\n*   Rome\n*   Atlanta\n*   Mar-a-Lago\n*   Florida\n*   Hungary\n*   Gaza\n*   Palestine\n*   Israel\n*   United States"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-42.104766845703125}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.691478Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4daZaaKpe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":1740},"candidatesTokenCount":60,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":60}],"promptTokenCount":455,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":455}],"thoughtsTokenCount":971,"totalTokenCount":1486,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.729089+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The voting coincides with International Women’s Day and could be another milestone in a transformative few decades during which Ireland has reshaped its Constitution in ways that reflect the country’s more secular and liberal modern identity.\n\nIf passed, the amendments would provide the latest updates to the Constitution, a document originally written in line with the values of the Roman Catholic Church and ratified in 1937, when religion and social conservatism dominated society.\n\nWhat exactly is the Irish public voting on?\n\nVoters will be asked to consider two separate questions.\n\nThe first asks whether the public is in favor of amending Article 41 of the Constitution to provide for a wider concept of family.\n\nAt present, the Constitution says: “The state recognizes the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.”\n\nIt adds: “The state pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.”\n\nThe new language would recognize a family, “whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships” as the fundamental unit of society. The words “on which the family is founded” would be removed from the clause about the state’s responsibility for guarding the institution of marriage.\n\nThe second question is about Article 41.2 of the Constitution, which currently says that the state “recognizes that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved” and that the state will “endeavor to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labor to the neglect of their duties in the home.”\n\nIf voters choose in favor, the reference to the role of women in the home would be removed. A new Article, 42B, would recognize and protect all family caregivers, saying: “The state recognizes that the provision of care, by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them, gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved, and shall strive to support such provision.”\n\nThe amendments would be another sign of a changing country.\n\nThe Irish Constitution was written at a time when the influence of the Roman Catholic Church was immense, and language that reflected the church’s social teachings was woven into the national document. It defined women in terms of their role as wives and mothers, and outlined their duties in the home.\n\nThe proposed changes would be another signal of Ireland’s move away from being a conservative state rooted in Catholic values — particularly around the role of women. That transformation has happened rapidly. At the start of the 1990s, divorce and gay marriage were illegal, and abortion was outlawed in nearly all cases.\n\nIn 1995, Ireland voted to end its ban on divorce, with a later referendum in 2019 further liberalizing divorce laws. In 2015, the country voted to legalize same-sex marriage, and, in 2018, to repeal the amendment that prohibited abortion.\n\nWhat do those who support the propositions say?\n\nRecent polling by The Irish Times has indicated that a majority of voters intends to approve both proposals. Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, a charity that promotes women’s rights and equality, said in a statement that the changes were a “chance to remove sexist language and limits on women from our Constitution.”\n\nVoting in favor, she said, “will be a long step away from this dark past and a small step toward recognizing the importance of care and the care roles of both women and men.”\n\nShe added: “We encourage all voters to really think: Do we want our young women and girls growing up in an Ireland where the Constitution still tells them that their primary place, indeed their ‘life,’ is in the home?” And that they have ‘duties’ and the boys and men don’t?”\n\nMary McAleese, a former president of Ireland, has campaigned in favor of the proposals. She said she thought that the changes “will reflect the overwhelming impulse for equality and inclusivity that is a hallmark of modern Ireland.”\n\nAll of the country’s major political parties have also called for voters to approve the overhaul. Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, speaking to reporters while he was campaigning in Dublin this week, urged the public to vote in favor of both proposals.\n\n“If there is a yes vote, we will be saying as a society that all families are equal and the marital status of parents shouldn’t affect that,” he said, referring to the family question. Regarding the second question, about the role of women, he added: “If there is a no vote, we will have very outdated language in our Constitution that will be there for the foreseeable future. I think that would be really unfortunate.”\n\nWhat about those opposed?\n\nCatholic bishops in Ireland issued a statement last month saying they believed that the proposed change to the family clause would “lead to a weakening of the incentive for young people to marry.”\n\nThey also expressed concern about the removal of the clause about women, saying, “It would have the effect of abolishing all reference to motherhood in the Constitution and leave unacknowledged the particular and incalculable societal contribution that mothers in the home have made and continue to make in Ireland.”\n\nOther critics have argued that the proposed language changes do not go far enough, particularly around the provisions for caregivers, while some have said that the new language is problematic. Free Legal Advice Centres, an independent human rights and equality body, said in a statement that it supported the change to in the first question, the definition of family, but rejected the wording in the second, about caregivers.\n\nThe proposed language intended to replace the reference to a women’s duties in the home “endorses a status quo where women undertake the bulk of unpaid care work and places no obligation whatsoever on the state to redress this gender imbalance — rendering it an implicitly sexist amendment,” the group said.\n\nMr. Varadkar, however, said that those who criticized the measures as not going far enough were missing the point.\n\n“I would very much see these referendums as further progress toward modernizing our Constitution, and incremental change in the right direction,” he said.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-4.602131366729736,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"The locations mentioned in the article are:\n\n*   Ireland\n*   Dublin"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-73.63410186767578}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:31.436018Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"X94dabLOGpe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5448},"candidatesTokenCount":16,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":16}],"promptTokenCount":1331,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1331}],"thoughtsTokenCount":643,"totalTokenCount":1990,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.615583+00:00"}

Mr. Biden may seek to continue to sharpen the contrasts between himself and Mr. Trump, casting his opponent as a threat to American democracy and pointing to the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election as just one of many things that make Mr. Trump unfit for office.\n\nMr. Trump, for his part, has made the 91 felony counts he is facing across four different cases, including the one in Georgia, a central part of his campaign message, portraying — without evidence — his many legal troubles as a plot by the Biden administration to interfere with the 2024 election.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4095209394182477,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1870,"startIndex":1540,"uri":"https://api.theflashnews.co/news/election-updates-biden-and-trump-kick-off-the-gen-65ec8298e137098279235223"},{"endIndex":2475,"startIndex":2173,"uri":"https://api.theflashnews.co/news/election-updates-biden-and-trump-kick-off-the-gen-65ec8298e137098279235223"},{"endIndex":3009,"startIndex":2714,"uri":"https://api.theflashnews.co/news/election-updates-biden-and-trump-kick-off-the-gen-65ec8298e137098279235223"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Nevada\n*   Georgia\n*   Fulton County\n*   America (implied by \"American democracy\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-49.33323287963867}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.869367Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dafeHNfmO1PIPvb23mAg","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":1456},"candidatesTokenCount":35,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":35}],"promptTokenCount":404,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":404}],"thoughtsTokenCount":840,"totalTokenCount":1279,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:48.793919+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: ''When people ask us whether it is OK for the United States to abandon Ukraine, the answer is no, because the world is operating not in a black-and-white way, or if you only look at one theater at a time,'' he said. ''The world is interconnected.''\n\nIf Russia is able to occupy more of Ukraine and claim victory, he added, ''it would be seen as a victory of authoritarian states because Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, they are now linked together.''\n\nMr. Wu's comments, made in a wide-ranging hourlong interview in Taipei, come as the Biden administration tries to get Congress to pass a supplemental funding package that would give $60 billion of aid to Ukraine.\n\nMany House Republicans are staunchly opposed to giving more aid to Ukraine, adopting the ''America First'' posture embraced by former President Donald J. Trump, a pro-Russia candidate who has pressed them to reject the package. For months they claimed they would be willing to consider providing more assistance for Kyiv if the Biden administration imposed severe immigration restrictions at the United States border with Mexico. But at Mr. Trump's urging, they balked at a funding package that would have done that, calling the border measures too weak.\n\nThe package also includes $8 billion of aid to counter China in the Asia-Pacific region, $1.9 billion of which would refill stocks of U.S. weapons sent to Taiwan. And it includes $14.1 billion of military aid to Israel.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers contend that China is a bigger threat than Russia and that the funding proposed for Ukraine should go toward countering China. But other Republican officials in Congress and many Democrats make the same argument as Mr. Wu: that Taiwan's security is linked to that of Ukraine, because China will see weakness on the part of the United States -- and a greater chance of success in a potential invasion of Taiwan -- if Ukraine is defeated.\n\nChinese leaders have said for decades that Taiwan, a de facto independent island, must be brought under the rule of the Communist Party, by force if necessary. Xi Jinping, China's leader, has continued to promote that position.\n\nThe U.S. and Taiwanese governments have been trying to deter China from notions of invading Taiwan, including through military buildup in the region and bolstering alliances with other democratic nations.\n\nIf the United States abandons Ukraine, Mr. Wu said, China will ''take it as a hint'' that if it can keep up sustained action against Taiwan, ''the United States is going to back off, the United States and its allies are going to back off.'' The thinking among Chinese officials would be this, he said: ''OK, since Russia could do that, we can do that as well.''\n\n''So the U.S. determination in providing support to those countries suffering from authoritarian aggression, it is very important,'' Mr. Wu said.\n\nAfter U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, China pushed propaganda through traditional state-run media and social media that ''the U.S. commitment to anything is not firm,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We suffered from a huge wave of cognitive warfare.''\n\nChina has also spread disinformation stressing Russian narratives of the war, Mr. Wu said, including the idea that the expansion of NATO forced President Vladimir V. Putin to attack Ukraine, and that the United States is ultimately not committed to supporting Ukraine.\n\nOn the eve of Russia's invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, and their two governments announced a ''no limits'' partnership.\n\nMr. Wu said some Central and Eastern European nations seeking to forge anti-authoritarian partnerships had strengthened their relations with Taiwan during the war.\n\nHis comments on the need for the United States to keep supporting Taiwan echo those of other senior Taiwanese officials. In May 2023, Bi-khim Hsiao, then Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United States and now the incoming vice president, made similar arguments to reporters in Washington.\n\nAnd in February, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said during a visit of American lawmakers to Taiwan that the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the president-elect, Lai Ching-te, made clear to the lawmakers that ''if for some reason the Ukrainians do not prevail, that will only encourage hostilities against Taiwan.''\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5512467317802962,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":884,"startIndex":504,"uri":"https://www.whatshappeninginchina.com/p/china-xi-met-us-executives"},{"endIndex":1222,"startIndex":859,"uri":"https://www.whatshappeninginchina.com/p/china-xi-met-us-executives"},{"endIndex":1807,"startIndex":1234,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":2048,"startIndex":1817,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":2561,"startIndex":2061,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":2806,"startIndex":2574,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":3045,"startIndex":2820,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":3301,"startIndex":3045,"uri":"https://www.oodaloop.com/briefs/2024/03/29/taiwans-top-diplomat-says-u-s-aid-to-ukraine-is-critical-for-deterring-china/"},{"endIndex":3435,"startIndex":3175,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":3856,"startIndex":3601,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":4157,"startIndex":3871,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":4827,"startIndex":4518,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"},{"endIndex":5207,"startIndex":4842,"uri":"https://molihua.org/%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E5%A4%96%E9%95%BF%EF%BC%9A%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD%E5%86%9B%E6%8F%B4%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AF%B9%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E5%B1%80%E5%8A%BF%E6%84%8F/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   United States\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   China\n*   North Korea\n*   Iran\n*   Taipei\n*   Kyiv\n*   Mexico\n*   Asia-Pacific\n*   Taiwan\n*   Israel\n*   Afghanistan\n*   Beijing\n*   Central and Eastern Europe\n*   Washington\n*   Illinois"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-47.40721893310547}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.697375Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4daZ_IKt601PIP-J6G2Q8","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3663},"candidatesTokenCount":86,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":86}],"promptTokenCount":919,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":919}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1512,"totalTokenCount":2517,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.9789+00:00"}

He was arrested shortly after the police received two emergency calls around 11 p.m. Wednesday requesting they come to the home, which is in a residential neighborhood, police officers said.\n\nOttawa’s police chief, Eric Stubbs, said at a news conference that the stabbings were the largest mass killing in the city, Canada’s capital, in at least three decades.\n\n“I want to emphasize this was a senseless act of violence perpetrated on purely innocent people,” Chief Stubbs said. “I know our whole community is shocked and mourning this event.”\n\nThe victims were identified as Darshani Banbaranayake Gama Walwwe Darshani Dilanthika Ekanyake, 35, the mother of the four children; Inuka Wickramasinghe, a 7-year-old boy; Ashwini Wickramasinghe, a 4-year-old girl; Rinyana Wickramasinghe, a 2-year-old girl; and Kelly Wickramasinghe, a 2-month-old girl.\n\nThe children’s father and Ms. Ekanyake’s husband, identified as Dhanushka Wickramasinghe in court documents, was seriously injured in the attack and was in stable condition at an area hospital.\n\nBhante Suneetha, a monk at the The Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery, where the family were active members, said that he spoke by phone on Thursday with Mr. Wickramasinghe, who he said is being hospitalized for slash wounds to his eyes and one of his hands.\n\nMr. Wickramasinghe told the monk that he arrived home from work on Wednesday night and was attacked when he opened the door, Mr. Suneetha said. Mr. Wickramasinghe was able to subdue his attacker before he discovered the other victims, he said.\n\nPolice officers said Mr. Wickramasinghe was seen on the street shouting for someone to call 911.\n\nThe sixth person killed, Amarakoonmubiayansela Ge Gamini Amarakoon, 40, was an acquaintance who had recently arrived from Sri Lanka and was living with the family. Mr. Suneetha said that he leaves a wife and two young children in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe police said they believed the victims were attacked with “an edged weapon” but did not provide any more details.\n\nAccording to Mr. Suneetha, Mr. Wickramasinghe arrived on his own in Canada as a student in 2020 and the rest of the family followed about a year ago. After his graduation from college, Mr. Wickramasinghe worked in a restaurant before starting his own cleaning business.\n\nThe family, Mr. Suneetha said, came to Canada with so many “dreams and plans.”\n\n“That is why they brought their kids here,” he said.\n\nWhile he was in school, Mr. Wickramasinghe lived in another Sri Lankan family’s home. Mr. De-Zoysa also boarded there, according to Mr. Suneetha. After that arrangement fell apart, Mr. Wickramasinghe invited Mr. De-Zoysa to live in the basement of his family’s home.\n\nMr. Suneetha said the family recently celebrated Mr. De-Zoysa’s 19th birthday.\n\nThe Wickramasinghe family regularly helped organize events at the temple, and Inuka, the 7-year-old, began his studies in meditation and Buddhism a week ago, Mr. Suneetha said.\n\nMembers of the temple were meeting on Wednesday to work out plans for the funerals and to support Mr. Wickramasinghe, as well as the family of Mr. Amarakoon.\n\nTwo police SUVs remained parked at the home nearly a full day after the killings. The police chief said it would take several days to process the scene.\n\nShanti Ramesh, a neighbor, said she saw about 15 police cruisers rush to the home on Wednesday night.\n\nMs. Ramesh watched as investigators began rolling out yellow crime-scene tape in front of the home. She went to bed thinking the scene would be cleared up overnight.\n\n“But when I saw the news in the morning, it was a shock that such a big tragedy happened in our city and just across my house,” she said, adding that she did not know the family who lived in the home.\n\nMass killings are rare in Canada, where the homicide rate in 2022 was about 2.3 killings per 100,000 people, about one-third of the rate in the United States that year.\n\nThere were 874 murders in Canada in 2022, according to the latest data from the census agency. They represented an 8 percent rise in the country’s homicide rate and the fourth year of consecutive increases.\n\nMark Sutcliffe, the mayor of Ottawa, offered his condolences.\n\n“We are fortunate to live in a safe city where these events are extremely rare,” he said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon. “Everyone, understandably, will react to this news today and feel less safe and secure.”\n\nAbout 100 people gathered at a gazebo on the edge of Palmadeo Park, just two blocks from the crime scene, for a memorial vigil on Thursday evening. Some stayed for a while; others stopped only to leave teddy bears, letters or bouquets of flowers.\n\n“They were so sweet, they were caring, they were kind. It was honestly very devastating,” Dayna Craigie, a former educational assistant at the children’s school, said. “I’m remembering them as innocent children who should not have had their lives taken away from them.”\n\nNeela Singh looked on with her two children, ages 4 and 11. They went to school with the victims, she said. Through tears, Ms. Singh described that afternoon’s school pickup as somber.\n\n“There were so many people around, yet no sound until the teacher came out,” she said.\n\nAfter the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the temple began holding special counseling and mediation sessions for students from Sri Lanka who, Mr. Suneetha said, seemed to be under ever-increasing stress.\n\n“After the pandemic, the society here in Canada is not so well,” he said.\n\nRecovery, Mr. Suneetha added, will take time for the temple’s 120 members. The temple is a hub for many members of the Sri Lankan community, including several hundred people who are not members of the temple, he said.\n\n“We will definitely need help from the society,” Mr. Suneetha said. “Not just from the Sri Lankan community, but the whole community.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6867122650146484,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":940,"startIndex":654,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":1800,"startIndex":1515,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":2138,"startIndex":1894,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":2578,"startIndex":2305,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":2937,"startIndex":2657,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":3290,"startIndex":3018,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":5415,"startIndex":5194,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":5724,"startIndex":5468,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"},{"endIndex":6674,"startIndex":6426,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/4-children-and-2-adults-are-killed-in-ottawa-home.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   The home (where the incident occurred, also referred to as \"house,\" \"residential neighborhood,\" \"crime scene,\" \"scene,\" \"basement\")\n*   Ottawa (the city, Canada's capital)\n*   Canada (the country)\n*   Hospital (area hospital)\n*   The Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Monastery (also referred to as \"the temple\")\n*   Street\n*   Sri Lanka\n*   Colombo (capital of Sri Lanka)\n*   College\n*   Restaurant\n*   School\n*   United States\n*   Gazebo\n*   Palmadeo Park"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-96.13971710205078}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.608939Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"a94daauVJcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5022},"candidatesTokenCount":140,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":140}],"promptTokenCount":1459,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1459}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2241,"totalTokenCount":3840,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:57.730907+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The organizers say they’re putting the games on a climate diet. These Olympics, they say, will generate no more than half the greenhouse gas emissions of recent Olympics. That means tightening the belt on everything that produces planet-warming emissions: electricity, food, buildings, and transportation, including the jet fuel that athletes and fans burn traveling the world to get there.\n\nAn event that attracts 10,500 athletes and an estimated 15 million spectators is, by definition, going to have an environmental toll. And that has led those who love the games but hate the pollution to suggest that the Olympics should be scattered around the world, in existing facilities, to eliminate the need for so much new construction and air travel. That’s why Paris is being watched so closely.\n\nIt is making more space for bikes and less for cars. It’s doing away with huge, diesel-powered generators, a fixture of big sporting events. It’s planning guest menus that are less polluting to grow and cook than typical French fare: more plants, less steak au poivre. Solar panels will float, temporarily, on the Seine.\n\nBut the organizers’ most significant act may be what they are not doing: They aren’t building. At least, not as much.\n\nInstead of building new showpieces for the games (which generates lots of greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing of concrete and steel), the Paris Olympics are repurposing many of the city’s existing attractions, including the Grand Palais, the plaza known as the Concorde and even a swimming pool built for the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\nIt’s not without controversy.\n\nOne notable emissions-reduction effort, a decision to forego conventional air-conditioning at the athletes’ village, has raised concerns. Instead, the buildings will rely on a cooling system that uses water pulled from underground. Several Olympic teams, are considering bringing their own air-conditioners.\n\nStill the hope is that experiments like these will offer a template for other Olympics in the future, and other cities worldwide. The few new buildings that are being built, including the athletes’ housing, as well as a swimming complex and an arena, are using less cement and more wood. They have solar panels and greenery on their roofs.\n\nThe new buildings are also meant to have a life far beyond the Olympics. They’re designed to be used by local residents for decades to come and, the leaders of the Paris 2024 organizing committee say, revitalize the city’s suburbs. “We set for ourselves ambitions that have never been set for any event before, let alone have this scale,” said Georgina Grenon, who is in charge of the games’ environmental efforts.\n\nCritics counter that, while much of what Paris is doing is commendable, particularly the limits on new construction, to truly address the climate crisis requires more than paring back emissions here and there. “We need to fundamentally rethink these huge mega events,” said Cesar Dugast, co-founder of a climate analysis group called Eclaircies. “Instead of concentrating all the events in a single city, it could be envisaged to distribute them around the world.”\n\n‘It’s a big test’\n\nThere’s a more immediate risk facing the Olympics: climate change itself. Rising global temperatures are making Paris summers dangerously hot. That has heightened concerns about how to protect athletes and fans in late July and August.\n\nCity officials say they have planted thousands of trees in recent years to temper summer heat. They are erecting misting towers to spray the air. The search is on for wide umbrellas under which fans can wait. “We have solutions. We are preparing,” said Dan Lert, the deputy mayor in charge of preparing the city for heat. “It’s a big test.”\n\nOne major thing that sets the Paris games apart from previous Olympics is that it has imposed a limit on the total emissions it will produce. The target: Generate no more than half the greenhouse gas emissions of the 2012 Olympics, which were held in London.\n\nLondon was chosen as a benchmark because the organizers there also sought to reduce emissions, and they measured them. Estimates like these are based on standard measures of, for instance, how much carbon dioxide is produced by the amount of cement used in new buildings.\n\nThe Paris organizers say they will offset those emissions by purchasing “carbon credits” to help fund emissions-reducing projects worldwide. The games organizers have not said what projects the games will fund and at what price. In any case, the market for carbon credits can be murky, with some projects not delivering on their promise.\n\nRefashioning a historic city\n\nWhat Paris is doing shows what can be done to remake an old city for a new global climate. It also shows what the limits are.\n\nThe Place de la Concorde, an 18th century plaza where guillotines were once erected during the French Revolution, this summer will be home to Olympic events like skateboarding.\n\nThe plaza is also now home to an unassuming metal box designed to spur an electricity revolution. It contains a high-powered electrical outlet connected to the national grid, enabling every big event on the plaza to throw off the shackles of diesel.\n\nDiesel generators are the dirty secret of sports events. Typically they are trucked in to provide a stable source of power.\n\nThe Paris games have also cut a special deal with the electric utility stipulating that there be enough wind and solar energy in the grid to produce all the energy that the games consume.\n\nWhen it comes to emissions, transportation is another headache. Paris has already been limiting space for cars and making space for bikes, and it’s using the games to accelerate that shift.\n\nBut the Olympics, with its huge crowds, threatens trouble for how Parisians get around their city, with many making plans to flee on vacation.\n\nPierre Rabadan, a former pro rugby player who is now Paris’ deputy mayor for sports, lifted his shoulders against a wind and walked briskly out of the tram stop in front of the city’s new basketball arena, at the top of Rue de la Chapelle. He pointed to an almost finished bike lane along the road, carved out of what had been a wide boulevard devoted to automobiles.\n\nSince the election of Anne Hidalgo as mayor in 2014, Paris has added some 600 kilometers of bike lanes. Around 10 percent have been dubbed Olympistes, a play on “piste,” the French word for track.\n\n“The problem is we built the city around cars,” Mr. Rabadan said.\n\nAnother problem is that the city’s metro system is bursting at the seams. Trains are already crowded, and workers are rushing to complete new extensions of two lines in time to serve the games.\n\nTo make room for Olympics visitors, the city has urged people to stay off the trains or work from home.\n\nTarzan and the old pool\n\nKey to the organizers’ climate strategy is to build as little as possible, which is why it is tapping into a leftover from the 1924 Paris Olympics: the Georges Vallerey swimming pool.\n\nIt’s getting a new air filtration system, as well as a new roof that lets in light but keeps out heat and cold. Old wood roof beams have been repurposed as countertops. The wooden bleachers, installed at least 40 years ago, remain. Sturdy stucco walls reveal the pool’s age.\n\n“We need not trash everything or destroy everything and put it in the bin,” said Mr. Rabadan.\n\nThe pool holds history. It is where Johnny Weissmuller, an American swimmer, won a gold medal in 1924. He went on to play Tarzan in a string of Hollywood movies, Mr. Rabadan is keen to point out.\n\nRoughly 95 percent of the venues to be used in the 2024 games are old buildings or temporary structures. For example, several temporary pools will be built for the games, then taken apart and re-installed in communities that have a dearth of public pools.\n\n‘A laboratory’\n\nThe Olympics, Ms. Grenon said, offer “a laboratory,” particularly when it comes to the buildings designed from scratch.\n\nA new aquatic center, on the edge of a highway in the northern suburb of Saint-Denis, is a showpiece of Douglas fir and pine. Its 5,000 square meter roof curves like a wave: The architects designed it that way to shrink the size of the building, reducing the energy needed to heat the space.\n\nThe pool is 5 meters deep only where necessary to have greater depth for diving, and shallower where it’s not. That too saves water and energy it takes to heat the water. Some of that heat will come from a nearby data center. The venue’s 5,000 seats are made from recycled plastic.\n\nThe goal, said Cécilia Gross, one of the architects, was “to do better with less.”\n\nRising nearby is the biggest new Olympics project: the 128-acre Athletes Village complex that is to morph into a mixed neighborhood for 6,000 residents afterward. Its builders say its emissions are at least 30 percent less than a conventional project of its size.\n\nTimber has a starring role here, too. The village is a cluster of mostly wood-frame buildings.\n\nWhile timber has its own environmental costs depending on how it’s grown, it is considered far more sustainable than concrete.\n\nIn the village, a small patch of sidewalk is paved with oyster shells that can be watered from an underground reservoir and cool the sidewalk on hot days. One experimental building is to recycle all its water. To cool the grounds, 9,000 trees have been planted, including local varieties like oaks and elms that can survive in a hotter future.\n\nThen there’s the unconventional air conditioning.\n\nA network of pipes, using water cooled by first being sent underground, will cool the interiors of the buildings in a technology known as a geo-exchange system. In New York City, St. Patrick’s Cathedral uses something similar, but using air instead of water. A smattering of U.S. universities are also switching to geoexchange.\n\nAlong with shade trees, insulation and a breeze from the river, the builders say indoor temperatures can be kept cool enough for the Paris summers of the future. However, the games organizers say, Olympic teams are still free to bring their own air conditioners.\n\nThe United States, Canada and Norway said they would. Australia and Ireland have too, according to press reports. The mayor, Ms. Hidalgo, in an interview with Reuters, urged teams to “trust the science.”\n\nLéontine Gallois contributed reporting from Paris.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4146974907546748,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Paris\n*   Grand Palais\n*   Concorde (or Place de la Concorde)\n*   Seine\n*   London\n*   Rue de la Chapelle\n*   Georges Vallerey swimming pool\n*   Saint-Denis (northern suburb of Paris)\n*   New York City\n*   St. Patrick's Cathedral\n*   United States\n*   Canada\n*   Norway\n*   Australia\n*   Ireland\n*   France (implied by \"French fare\" and \"French Revolution\")\n*   Hollywood"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-172.5930938720703}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:30.849376Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Xt4daeDrM8K2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":8607},"candidatesTokenCount":122,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":122}],"promptTokenCount":2225,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":2225}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1190,"totalTokenCount":3537,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.42837+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Zulfiqar spoke with former caretaker minister Zubair Jamali and asked him to comment on the recent incident of the martyrdom of military officers. Jamali said it is a very gloomy event for a family to receive the dead body of their young son. He noted a lieutenant colonel, captain and five soldiers have been martyred, and they have sacrificed their lives for the country. He remarked such incidents prove to be a \"binding force\" for the country and people need to realise that if they are living safely in their villages and cities, it is \"at the cost of soldiers who are fighting against terrorism on borders and within the country\". He added people should be thankful to the martyrs and their families for their sacrifice.\n\nSenior journalist Saleem Shahid said it was a very sad incident, but it should be noted that the officers and soldiers fought against \"terrorists\" and killed six of them before embracing martyrdom.&#160;He noted incidents of terrorism have increased recently. He was of the view that such incidents cannot be planned and executed by a small group and large-scale resources are behind them which are only available to a state. He claimed due to this, some state is behind these incidents and is funding such elements.\n\nZulfiqar noted President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over martyrdom of the military personnel and expressed a firm resolve that \"revenge\" would be taken for the killing. He asked Mir Saadat Baloch, pro-vice chancellor of the Panjgur University, to comment on the same. Baloch paid tributes to the martyred soldiers and said Zardari's reaction to the incident is \"understandable\" because his family has also been a victim (his wife and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in an attack).\n\nCommenting on the alleged social media campaign ridiculing the martyrs, Jamali insisted elements involved in \"insulting propaganda\" should be \"gripped with a hard fist\". He said the martyrs have offered the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their lives, so the government and civil society should \"thrash\" such elements.\n\nShahid said the propaganda insulting martyrs is \"highly deplorable\" and such comments are very painful for their families. He added people should realise that \"their existence is linked to the existence of the country\" and being \"country-less\" is a huge tragedy. He insisted the government should take serious action against such people.\n\nBaloch condemned those targeting martyrs with malicious campaigns and said a \"strategy\" should be devised, not only against those who are active on social media, but also against those who are encouraging them. He recalled a foreign institution had conducted a survey before elections to assess whether people's confidence in the military had declined. He noted according to the results of the survey, \"89 per cent of the youth all over Pakistan expressed confidence in the military\". He agreed that action must be taken against those involved in propaganda.\n\nCommenting on a recent meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Jamali said it is a \"positive gesture\" as everyone needs to work jointly for the country. Shahid commented coordination among different institutions is necessary for improving the economy. He noted the caretaker government took important steps to solve economic issues which should be taken forward by the new government. He said opposition parties should not create hurdles in the working of the new government. Baloch remarked people need to rise above party politics in the larger interest of the country.\n\nZulfiqar said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met a young student from Balochistan on 17 March. He noted Sharif had met the student in 2022 while visiting flood-hit areas and had helped the youth enrol in a reputable college. Jamali appreciated the prime minister's action and urged him to establish a network of quality schools in Balochistan, like he did in Punjab under his government. Baloch remarked it is a \"welcome message\" from the prime minister which would encourage students to focus more on their education.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 17 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4336372824276196,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Panjgur (Panjgur University)\n*   Pakistan\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n*   Balochistan\n*   Punjab\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-73.1155014038086}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:31.436388Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"X94daaTRGvDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3542},"candidatesTokenCount":51,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":51}],"promptTokenCount":855,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":855}],"thoughtsTokenCount":772,"totalTokenCount":1678,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.655252+00:00"}

Even if Judge McAfee allows an appeal to go forward, the Georgia Court of Appeals would have to agree to take the case.\n\nThe judge’s ruling last Friday followed weeks of public hearings delving into a romantic relationship between Ms. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, and Nathan J. Wade, the lawyer she hired to run the Trump case. The defendants had argued that the relationship created an untenable conflict of interest for Ms. Willis.\n\nJudge McAfee disagreed, but found that it had raised “a significant appearance of impropriety” that could be addressed by Mr. Wade withdrawing from the case.\n\nIn their filing on Monday, the defendants said that Mr. Wade’s resignation was “insufficient to cure the appearance of impropriety the court has determined exists.” If an appeal is not allowed now, they wrote, any eventual convictions could be subject to retrial if the judge’s decision is overturned later.\n\n“The court’s order is ripe for pretrial appellate review,” Steven H. Sadow, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer in Georgia, said in a statement.\n\nMs. Willis’s office had no immediate comment. Neither she nor Mr. Wade have spoken publicly since the ruling, beyond releasing his resignation letter and her response to it. This weekend, the NBC show “Meet the Press” announced that Mr. Wade had agreed to come on the Sunday morning program for an interview. But hours later, it said that Mr. Wade had backed out.\n\nThe defendants’ motion on Monday also noted a speech that Ms. Willis gave at a church in Atlanta on Jan. 14, in which she suggested that criticism of her and Mr. Wade was prompted by racism. Mr. Sadow had argued that the speech itself was grounds for disqualifying Ms. Willis.\n\nJudge McAfee, in his ruling last Friday, said that the speech was “legally improper,” but also that there was not enough legal precedent in Georgia to guide him on whether he should disqualify Ms. Willis for it.\n\nIn seeking the judge’s permission to pursue an appeal, the defendants argued that this lack of precedent was another reason for the appellate court to weigh in.\n\nMr. Trump and 14 others are charged with racketeering and a number of other crimes related to accusations that they conspired to overturn the former president’s 2020 election loss in the state.

Two of the students complied, but a third refused, causing an “altercation,” according to the Paris prosecutor’s office.\n\nSince 2004, middle and high school students in France have been barred from wearing “ostentatious” symbols that have a clear religious meaning, like a Catholic cross, a Jewish skullcap or a Muslim head scarf.\n\nThe full details of the altercation are unclear. But the incident quickly drew national attention in France, where the perceived encroachment of Islam in the public school system is an extremely sensitive topic.\n\nThe country remains deeply scarred by the killing of two schoolteachers by Islamist extremists in recent years.\n\nThe student told investigators that the principal had pushed her and hit her arm, but the Paris prosecutor’s office said that a complaint she had filed accusing the principal of assault had been dropped over a lack of evidence. The principal filed a separate suit accusing the student of intimidating a public official, the prosecutor’s office said.\n\nThe government and politicians across the spectrum have defended the principal and disputed the accusations of violence made against him.\n\nFrench officials have not publicly identified the principal or the student. The regional education authority for Paris said that the student dropped out of the school shortly after the incident.\n\nThe controversy began to draw greater national attention last week after the principal decided to step down. In a message to school staff that was shared with the French media, he said he had decided to leave over concerns about his personal safety and the school’s own security.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal said that the threats against the principal were “unacceptable” and announced on Wednesday that the government would file a legal complaint against the student, accusing her of trying to “intimidate” the principal by making wrongful accusations of violence against him, leading to a wave of online death threats.\n\n“Laïcité is constantly being put to the test,” Mr. Attal told a national television station on Wednesday about the case, referring to France’s version of secularism, which guarantees freedom of conscience but also the strict neutrality of the state and of some public spaces.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office said it had opened an investigation into the death threats and “cyber-harassment” faced by the principal. Three people have already been arrested, and one of them will face trial next month, the prosecutor’s office said.\n\nMr. Attal, who met with the principal on Wednesday, said that the principal was scheduled to retire in June but had decided to step down earlier because of the threats. The prime minister added that the state would be unwavering in its support for “all of those who are on the front lines of these attacks on laïcité.”\n\nIn his former position as education minister, Mr. Attal had spearheaded a ban in schools of the abaya, a loosefitting, full-length robe worn by some Muslim women.\n\nNicole Belloubet, Mr. Attal’s successor at the ministry, visited the school in early March to express support for the principal, and she assured lawmakers this week that he had been given full legal and moral assistance. Police officers were also deployed in front of the school as a precautionary measure after the incident occurred, she said.\n\nIn a video published by the Collective for Countering Islamophobia in Europe — a Belgium-based activist group that was created after a similar one was disbanded by the government in France — the student said that the altercation happened as she was leaving school.\n\nSpeaking with her face blurred to conceal her identity, the student said that she was starting to cover her head with a hat as she prepared to put on her head scarf when the principal shouted at her to remove it.\n\nBefore she could comply, she said, the principal “pushed me violently” and “hit me hard on the arm,” then he tried to drag her to his office until another student intervened, she said.\n\nThe Collective for Countering Islamophobia in Europe condemned the death threats against the principal but accused the French government of “fueling a climate of conflict within schools, pitting teachers, pupils and families against each other.”\n\n“We want to reiterate our commitment to the fight against all forms of harassment and discrimination, especially toward Muslim students, who are under undue pressure in the current climate,” the group said in a statement.\n\nFor many in France, the case echoed the chain reaction that led to the killing of Samuel Paty in 2020. The history teacher was beheaded in a northwestern suburb of Paris by an Islamist assailant after he showed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to his students in an attempt to illustrate free speech.\n\nMr. Paty was murdered less than two weeks after a schoolgirl lied about attending his class and made false accusations against him — setting off a spiral of online rumors that ultimately put the killer on his trail.\n\nThe killing last year of Dominique Bernard, a French literature teacher who was stabbed to death at a high school in northern France by a radicalized former student, put the country further on edge.\n\nIn an interview with French television on Thursday, Mickaëlle Paty, Mr. Paty’s sister, praised the government’s swift reaction to the incident at Lycée Maurice-Ravel.

Several students said that they had not witnessed the incident themselves, but were taken aback by the national attention it had received and the rumors it had spawned.\n\n“The rules are the rules, we all signed them at the beginning of the year: it says the head scarf is banned inside the school,” said Yacine Kone, 16.

For some time now, terror activities have been taking place on a daily basis, she said. Pakistan and Afghanistan relations have soured due to this issue, Memon said. The opposition wants to start a campaign against rigging in the elections. Security and the economy are inter-connected, she added. Panellists included Islamabad bureau chief of Sindh TV News, Shakir Solangi, and senior analyst Shaheen Qureshi.&#160;\n\nSolangi said, \"The law and order situation in KP is deteriorating by the day. During the election campaign, Maulana Fazlur Rehman [head of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, or JUI] had said that he could not campaign in KP's Dera Ismail Khan due to terror threats. The Afghan authorities are not cooperating with Pakistan. Just yesterday, Chinese nationals were attacked. Several arrested terrorists are from Afghanistan. Today, the prime minister chaired a meeting with regard to security and decided to continue the fight against terrorists. The investor will not come to Pakistan in this situation. There is no terrorism in Sindh but there is a law and order situation, in which dacoits are openly threatening the Sindhi society. The traders in Sindh are worried and cannot run their businesses peacefully. Similar is the situation in Balochistan. There is peace in Punjab province only. The PPP had restored peace in Swat during 2008-13 government. The PTI and the PML-N have a soft corner for the terrorists. The TTP has the weapons left by the United States in Afghanistan. The Afghan government is unmoved on Pakistani concerns about these terrorists. Maulana Rehman has announced that he will start his campaign from 25 April, protesting against rigging in the general elections. The PTI always hold violent protests, whereas Maulana Rehman's protests have always been peaceful. Hence, it is not possible that these parties will protest jointly.\"\n\nQureshi said, \"Pakistan is being attacked at a time when it is facing its worst economic situation. The terrorists are targeting Chinese nationals. China is helping Pakistan to stabilise its economy. Pakistan needs political and economic stability. This attack is very serious. We need to be aware the we are a target for our enemies. We are under a lot of debt. Today we are living in a hybrid system. The parliament seems to have lost its importance and credibility. Our interior minister is also heading the cricket board. It seems to have a very unserious attitude. Only parliament can unite the nation. The PTI had released terrorists during its tenure in government and wanted to bring those terrorists in to the main stream politics. The situation today is the result of confusion about the policy about these terrorists. The National Action Plan is in cold storage now. The situation is very alarming.

A petition against these six judges has also been filed, she said. The PTI, in a strong reaction, has demanded to declare all the sentences against Imran Khan as null and void, Mir said. The Supreme Court has held a full court meeting in this regard. The security situation in the country is also very serious, she said. The killing of Chinese nationals is another serious matter, she added. Panellists included Dr Karim Khawaja of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), former diplomat Alam Brohi, analyst Aijaz Qureshi and journalist Aijaz Mehar.&#160;\n\nKhawaja said, \"Five years ago, another judge, Shaukat Siddiqui, had also accused security personnel of interference in judiciary. This is a continuation of the same. Pakistan has a history of judicial crises. The judiciary itself is to blame for being weak. It is hoped that the full court will decide in the interests of the country. [The killing of Chinese nationals] is a condemnable act. This is to fail the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Whatever happens in Pakistan will destabilise the whole region. It is being said that in the next 20 years, China will be the superpower of the world.\"\n\nBrohi said, \"The attacks on Chinese nationals have taken place several times. We are continuously confronting security issues. We need to have a consensus on security issues. This situation is for the last two decades. The purpose of targeting Chinese nationals is to stop foreign investments in Pakistan. The question arises whether we hold such talks in the media after every incident and then forget the issue. Recently attacks were also conducted in Gwadar and Turbat in Balochistan. It is a golden opportunity for all stakeholders to decide on the judicial matters once for all and correct all its past mistakes. The establishment has been interfering in politics and the judiciary for a long time.\"\n\nMehar said, \"The CPEC was a game-changer programme for Pakistan. India is not happy with it and the United States also has reservations. There are several foreign elements that do not like this project. Freelance jihadis may have conducted this attack. If security agencies interfere in political issues, then these attacks may happen. The timing of the letter is very important. This is the time when Imran Khan's cases are being heard in the courts. The former chief justice [Umar Ata] Bandial did not take up Justice Siddiqui's case. The situation in the judiciary is very unfortunate. Now we have to see what the full court decides in this case. Let's wait for the full court's decision. Parliament should also discuss the issue in detail. In the past, the judiciary has been undermining the parliament.\"\n\nQureshi said, \"The timing of this letter is very important. Pakistani judicial history tells us that such interference started at the beginning of inception of this country. The judiciary introduced a doctrine of necessity and that started all this interference. We had several judges in the past who were supported by the military establishment. I agree that parliament should play its role. We are in a very difficult situation. Chinese are being killed because China is helping Pakistan. This is a very important juncture in our history.

Two U.S. officials said the package also includes an older version of the Army’s longer-range missile systems known as ATACMS, which can travel 100 miles.\n\nIt is a stopgap measure at best, the officials said, but Ukraine is in dire need of air defense systems in particular, as Russia has continued its bombardment of towns particularly in the east.\n\nThe makeshift solution would keep advancing Russian troops at bay for only a few weeks, one official said.\n\nAnnouncing the aid package at the White House, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that “Ukrainian troops have fought bravely, are fighting bravely throughout this war, but they are now forced to ration their ammunition under pressure on multiple fronts.”\n\nHe said the new package would “keep Ukraine’s guns firing for a period, but only a short period.” Mr. Sullivan called for Congress to pass a new Ukraine aid bill “as soon as possible.”\n\nHe said that Ukraine desperately needed the assistance to hold the line against Russian attacks, but that “it goes without saying this package does not displace and should not delay the critical need to pass the bipartisan national security bill.”\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his overnight address, thanked “the United States and all Americans who value freedom” for their support of his country.\n\nThe Senate passed an emergency aid bill including $60.1 billion for Ukraine. But the measure faces an uncertain fate in the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders have refused to put the measure to a vote. While congressional officials say there is a critical mass of support for continuing to arm Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, the Republican Party is increasingly turning away from its traditional hawkish posture and belief in projecting American power and democratic principles around the world.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican of Louisiana who has opposed aiding Ukraine, must navigate a handful of ultraconservative lawmakers who have said they will move to oust him if he allows a vote on Ukraine aid without stringent immigration measures attached.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, urged Mr. Johnson to hold a vote on the Ukraine aid package.\n\n“I want to encourage the speaker again to allow a vote,” he said.\n\nFor President Biden, who has led the way in calling for the West to stand up for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and occupation, the issue has become an embarrassing one on the international stage.\n\nThe American political paralysis has led, Pentagon officials said, to critical shortages on the battlefields of Ukraine. As each day goes by without a fresh supply of munitions and artillery, and Ukrainian crews ration the shells they have, morale suffers.\n\n“When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back; that’s costing terrain,” Mr. Sullivan said. “It’s costing lives and it’s costing us, the United States and the NATO alliance, strategically.”\n\nSince Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has sent more than $75 billion in cash and equipment to the country for its defense. Most of the aid has gone to Ukraine’s military operations, keeping its government running and addressing its humanitarian needs.\n\nThe money ran out in December, and Mr. Biden asked Congress for the authority to begin a new infusion of cash and equipment that only it can approve. But many Republicans object to pouring more taxpayer dollars into the conflict.\n\nSenior intelligence officials warned on Monday that without additional American aid, Ukraine faced the prospect of continued battlefield losses as Russia uses a network of arms suppliers and increases its supply of technology from China.\n\nIn public testimony during the annual survey of worldwide threats facing the United States, the officials told Congress that any continued delay of U.S. aid would lead to additional territorial gains by Russia over the next year, the consequences of which would be felt in Europe and in the Pacific.\n\nOn Tuesday, Denmark also announced a new $340 million military aid package for Ukraine.\n\nConstant Méheut contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.820684779774059,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":913,"startIndex":540,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":2643,"startIndex":2421,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":3637,"startIndex":3128,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":4209,"startIndex":3983,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":5235,"startIndex":5001,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":6245,"startIndex":5959,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":7326,"startIndex":7034,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   U.S. / United States\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   East (referring to a region within Ukraine)\n*   White House\n*   Louisiana\n*   Kentucky\n*   The West (referring to Western countries/alliance)\n*   Pentagon\n*   China\n*   Europe\n*   Pacific\n*   Denmark"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-72.22026062011719}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.577215Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4dab-dI8CSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3763},"candidatesTokenCount":88,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":88}],"promptTokenCount":879,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":879}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2033,"totalTokenCount":3000,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.131707+00:00"}

People have been working continuously for the second day.\n\nAt this moment, normal power supply has been restored almost everywhere. There were some problems today in our city of Odesa &#8211; there were emergency shutdowns. Everything possible is being done to normalize the situation. Unfortunately, in Kharkiv, it's still very challenging. Today, there was another missile strike from Russia &#8211; these strikes continue daily. And everyone who is working to keep normal life in Kharkiv, in the region, in other border cities and communities, they are all true heroes. I thank every rescuer of our State Emergency Service of Ukraine, all employees of energy companies involved, police officers, local services, volunteers &#8211; everyone who is helping. Thank you for your dedication to protecting people!\n\nI want to specifically acknowledge and thank the experts in Ivano-Frankivsk region, Vinnytsya, Khmelnytskyy, Sumy region, Poltava region, our Dnipropetrovsk region, and Zaporizhzhya. Thank you for your efficient work! Today, I received reports from the regions, from the head of the government, from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, of course, from our military. The state must ensure a systematic response to every Russian strike.\n\nI also want to recognize all the leaders of states, heads of international institutions, and all our partners who have expressed their support for Ukraine these days. It is important to act together every time missiles and drones attempt to destroy our lives. To act to reduce the potential for terror, to block it. This particularly concerns air defense systems, as well as sanctions. All these Iskander, Kinzhal and other Russian missiles have dozens of components imported for terror from other countries. The missiles used in this attack against Ukraine, against our energy system, had at least three hundred types of components from ten countries. Together with the \"Shahed\" drones, there were at least seven and a half thousand components in total. Each of them represents a violation of sanctions regimes against Russia, each one represents someone's attempt to make money from destroying lives. This needs to be stopped.\n\nAnother thing. What happened yesterday in Moscow is obvious, both Putin and other scoundrels simply try to blame everything on someone else. They always resort to the same methods. It's been done before. There have been blown-up houses, shootings, and explosions. And they always blame others. They have come to Ukraine, burn our cities &#8211; and try to blame Ukraine. They torture, rape people &#8211; and accuse them. They have brought hundreds of thousands of their terrorists here, to Ukrainian land, they fight against us, and they don't care what's happening inside their own country. Yesterday all this happened, and this absolute miserable Putin, instead of attending to his own citizens of Russia, addressing them, remained silent for a day &#8211; thinking about how to link this with Ukraine. Everything is absolutely predictable. Those hundreds of thousands of Russians who are now killing on Ukrainian land would surely be enough to stop any terrorists. And if the Russians are ready to silently die in \"Crocus Halls\" and not ask any questions to their security and intelligence agencies, then Putin will try to turn such a situation to his personal advantage again.\n\nTerrorists must always lose. I thank everyone who truly defends life! I'm grateful to all our people who are fighting against terror. And around the world, we must defend against those who consider people merely expendable.\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nSource: Ukrainian president's website, Kyiv, in English 2000 GMT 23 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5975729135366586,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":2413,"startIndex":2169,"uri":"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3843941-zelenskyy-around-world-we-must-defend-against-those-who-consider-people-merely-expendable.html"},{"endIndex":3143,"startIndex":2653,"uri":"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3843941-zelenskyy-around-world-we-must-defend-against-those-who-consider-people-merely-expendable.html"},{"endIndex":3448,"startIndex":3175,"uri":"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3843941-zelenskyy-around-world-we-must-defend-against-those-who-consider-people-merely-expendable.html"},{"endIndex":4873,"startIndex":4539,"uri":"https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-ukraine-moscow-concert-hall-terrorist-attack-russia/"},{"endIndex":5180,"startIndex":4952,"uri":"https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3843941-zelenskyy-around-world-we-must-defend-against-those-who-consider-people-merely-expendable.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Odesa\n*   Kharkiv\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Ivano-Frankivsk region\n*   Vinnytsya\n*   Khmelnytskyy\n*   Sumy region\n*   Poltava region\n*   Dnipropetrovsk region\n*   Zaporizhzhya\n*   Moscow\n*   Crocus Halls"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-54.37913513183594}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.687092Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dafT3KcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3318},"candidatesTokenCount":91,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":91}],"promptTokenCount":819,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":819}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1365,"totalTokenCount":2275,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:50.475169+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: “Vote for our president. Together we’re strong,” read the sign in the white, blue and red colors of the Russian flag, according to Anastasiia, a resident.\n\nThe message was clear to her: that the president was Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, not Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and that Mr. Putin was the only choice in the Russian presidential vote taking place in the occupied parts of Ukraine over the past three weeks.\n\nMr. Putin long ago transformed Russian elections into a predictable ritual meant to convey legitimacy to his rule. In the occupied territories, this practice has the additional goals of presenting the occupation as a fait accompli and identifying dissenters, said political analysts and Ukrainian officials.\n\n“Elections in these regions fix the idea that they have the same laws and procedures as the rest of the country,” said Ilya Grashchenkov, a Russian political scientist who is advising a long-shot candidate running against Mr. Putin. That has the effect, he said, of weaving them into the fabric of Russian statehood.\n\nFor many in the occupied territories, the electoral ritual is unfolding under the watchful eyes of armed soldiers.\n\nWearing face coverings, the soldiers have accompanied poll workers door-to-door throughout the occupied parts of the four Ukrainian regions that Russia has annexed after invading the country two years ago, according to local residents, statements by Russian officials and videos posted on social media.\n\nOccupation officials say the show of force is necessary to protect those collecting votes.\n\nThe poll workers are soliciting votes that are set to give Mr. Putin, who has no serious challenger on the ballot, his fifth term as president and another six years in office.\n\nUkrainian officials, Western allies and rights groups have called the elections an illegal sham. They say the vote is marred by widespread intimidation and coercion and is part of a wider campaign of repression against the residents of the occupied regions.\n\n“They promote it, even though it’s not a real election,” said Anastasiia, the Luhansk region resident. “Everybody knows who will win.”\n\nAnastasiia, 19, left the occupied territories this month to build her life away from the war zone. Citing fear of retribution, she asked to be identified by her first name only and to omit the name of her town to protect relatives who remained behind.\n\nFew countries, if any, are expected to recognize the election results in the occupied regions, which include the Crimea peninsula, annexed in 2014 after Russia’s earlier aggression in southeastern Ukraine. The United Nations considers all of the territory to be part of Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts say the coercion, the numerous electoral machinations and the exodus of pro-Ukrainian residents mean that Mr. Putin is almost certain to obtain an even larger landslide in the occupied regions than in the rest of Russia.\n\nFor the Kremlin, it is the electoral process itself, rather than the margin of victory, that furthers its cause.\n\nConducting elections, no matter how orchestrated and unfair, in the occupied regions allows Mr. Putin to solidify his claim to them. It also allows him to portray himself as a champion of democracy and draw contrast with Ukraine, which suspended its presidential voting this year because of the war, said Mr. Grashchenkov, the political analyst.\n\nRussia has already conducted two previous elections in the four regions of eastern and southern Ukraine that it has partly occupied since invading the country. The Kremlin claimed that 99 percent of the residents of Donetsk, the most populous of the occupied regions, chose to join Russia in 2022. Mr. Putin’s party candidates won a landslide victory in local voting held across the occupied territories last year.\n\nUkraine and Western nations have called those elections shams.\n\nApart from such votes, Russia has stamped out Ukrainian identity and language with Russian curriculums in schools, required Russian passports for employment and cracked down on people with pro-Ukrainian political views.\n\nRussia’s attempts to replicate a normal election process often clash with the realities of war, sometimes in farcical ways.\n\nFor starters, Russia does not completely control the regions where it is purporting to conduct voting. And just months after it held a sham referendum as a way of proclaiming that the city of Kherson was part of Russia, its forces had to abandon the city to the Ukrainian army. (Russia remains in control of the southern portion of Kherson province.)\n\nA similar dissonance emerged as this month’s rubber-stamp presidential balloting approached.\n\nLittle is known, for example, about how many voters there are. The constant shifting of the front lines, the flight of the local residents and the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers and workers have dramatically transformed the demographics of the occupied regions. The full effect of this transformation remains largely unknown, because of strict Russian censorship and the ongoing fighting.\n\nBut the few available estimates point to a drastic decrease in the occupied population. Figures from Russia’s electoral commission show that the occupied part of the Kherson region, for example, lost 13 percent of its registered voters, or 75,000 adults, in the last three months of last year.\n\nOverall, Russia’s electoral body claims the four Ukrainian regions that were annexed in 2022 have 4.5 million voters. This would represent a 33 percent drop from the last voter roll published by the Ukrainian government before the full-scale invasion. Ukrainian officials say the real number today is likely to be even lower.\n\nThe picture is complicated further by the Russian government’s decision to allow hundreds of thousands of soldiers stationed in the occupied territories to vote there. Russian propaganda videos published on social media have shown electoral workers dodging shells and diving into ditches to deliver ballot boxes to stoic soldiers in the trenches.\n\nRussian authorities have not published the locations of the polling stations or the names of the members of the local electoral commissions. It has also leveraged the system to the state’s advantage.\n\nOccupation officials have designated the occupied territories as “remote,” a label previously reserved for places like the reindeer herder communities in the Arctic. This has allowed Russia to extend the voting period there for three weeks, making the process even harder to monitor. Polls in two of the occupied regions, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, opened on Feb. 25 and will close on March. 17, when voting ends in Russia.\n\nThe “remote” designation has also allowed pro-Russian electoral officials to go door-to-door soliciting votes from residents of the occupied regions. And because voting there is taking place under martial law, these officials are accompanied by armed soldiers.\n\n“Dear voters, we care about your safety!” the electoral commission for the occupied Zaporizhzhia wrote in a Telegram post this month, which showed camouflaged voters with blurred faces casting ballots. “You don’t need to go anywhere to vote — we will come with the ballots and the ballot boxes to your home.”\n\nRussia’s electoral commission claimed that nearly 1.4 million votes had been cast in remote regions by March 11. In the last Russian presidential election, held in 2018, remote regions in Russia’s far north and east accounted for just 180,000 votes.\n\nUkrainian officials say this turnout is achieved by intimidation.\n\n“‘Voting’ is conducted at gunpoint,” Dmytro Lubinets, the human rights ombudsman in Ukraine’s Parliament, said in a statement this month. “Participation in such ‘elections’ is a matter of survival.”\n\nThe actual wishes of the majority of the residents are impossible to decipher. No independent opinion polls have been published in the occupied territories since the invasion. And the exodus of pro-Ukrainian residents mean that many of those who remain often support, or have at least resigned themselves, to the occupation.\n\nRussian officials have justified extraordinary voting procedures in the occupied territories as a security necessity. Ukrainian forces and partisans have frequently targeted Russian collaborators and occupation officials, including electoral workers.\n\nMost recently, a deputy mayor of Berdiansk, on the Azov Sea coast, died in a car explosion on March 6. Ukraine’s military intelligence took responsibility, saying the official, Svetlana Samoilenko, was assassinated for forcing residents to “participate in illegal, fake voting.”\n\nUkrainian officials say Russia is also using elections to identify residents who are unhappy with its rule. The government in Kyiv says Ukrainians are routinely jailed, tortured or summarily executed by invading forces under a campaign of forced “Russification” of the occupied territories.\n\n“If you vote, you are loyal to Russia, you have opportunities,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst. “If not, well, then you will be under pressure. You will be investigated.”\n\nAlina Lobzina contributed reporting from London.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.965989621480306,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Luhansk region\n*   Crimea peninsula\n*   Donetsk (region/city)\n*   Kherson (city/province/region)\n*   Zaporizhzhia (region)\n*   Berdiansk\n*   Azov Sea\n*   Kyiv\n*   London\n*   Arctic (mentioned as a type of remote region)\n*   Southeastern Ukraine\n*   Eastern and Southern Ukraine\n*   Russia's far north and east"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-115.91875457763672}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.662300Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4daZy2KMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":7703},"candidatesTokenCount":120,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":120}],"promptTokenCount":1826,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1826}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1085,"totalTokenCount":3031,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.408193+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The election, which is likely to be one of the most closely watched in Africa this year, was initially set for Feb. 25, but Mr. Sall unexpectedly put it off, with no announcement of a new date. He cited an inquiry into allegations of corruption at the Constitutional Court, but political opponents and some analysts called the maneuver a constitutional coup. His decision Wednesday to set a date may allay some of the fears that he was trying to remain in office.\n\nThe political deadlock prompted alarm among Senegal’s international allies, including the United States and European countries, which have long considered the coastal West African nation of 17 million people a reliable diplomatic partner. It is also a favored recipient of aid in a part of Africa that has been convulsed by coups and where aging leaders have kept their hold on power despite constitutional limits.\n\nThe Constitutional Court, Senegal’s highest tribunal, promptly overturned Mr. Sall’s attempt to delay the election last month. Shortly after the court’s decision, the president said he would leave power on April 2, when his term will expire.\n\nBut who will lead the country between the April deadline and the swearing in of a new president remains unclear. Senegal may require a runoff election after results come in for the voting on March 24, but the government did not set a date for a runoff, nor did it specify who would govern the country in the interim.\n\nMr. Sall also dismissed his prime minister, Amadou Ba, according to the statement. Mr. Ba is the presidential candidate of Mr. Sall’s party, and the dismissal on Wednesday added confusion as to whether Mr. Sall still supported him.\n\nSidiki Kaba, the interior minister, will serve as prime minister, according to Yoro Dia, Mr. Sall’s spokesman. With the cabinet dissolved, Mr. Kaba will form one of his own.\n\nMr. Sall has been in office for two terms and is barred by Senegal’s Constitution from seeking a third. The country has faced years of political upheaval and uncertainty. Over the past three years, during Mr. Sall’s second term, the government jailed hundreds of protesters and political opponents, repeatedly forbade protests and cut off the internet.\n\nOver the past few weeks, however, Mr. Sall’s government has softened its stance against the opposition and civil-society groups, allowing demonstrations again and adopting an amnesty law that benefits political prisoners. It has also reopened Cheikh Anta Diop university, one of West Africa’s most prestigious and a hot spot for demonstrations. The university was closed last June after antigovernment riots erupted in the capital, Dakar.\n\nMr. Sall has also said that he is ready to pardon Ousmane Sonko, his biggest political opponent, who is in jail and barred from running in the coming election.\n\nSome analysts said that, despite signs over the past two years that Mr. Sall might try to cling to power, he had backtracked to preserve his, and Senegal’s, global image.\n\n“Macky Sall had for a while been the spoiled child of the international community — from France to the United States, but also Russia and Arab countries,” said Alioune Tine, a well-known Senegalese human rights defender who has played an informal mediating role between the president and the opposition in recent weeks.\n\n“That capital was at risk of collapsing when he postponed the election,” Mr. Tine said, but he added that Mr. Sall “now wants to exit in an honorable way.”\n\nNineteen candidates are scheduled to compete in the presidential balloting now set for March 24, including Mr. Ba, the now former prime minister, and Bassirou Diomaye Faye, the candidate for the leading opposition party. Whether Mr. Sonko could participate in the election if Mr. Sall were to pardon him is unclear.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Russian pundit Abbas Galyamov has said that in terms of the formal results, there will be nothing unexpected. \"But questions could arise from the point of view of real content. Will the real sense of Putin&#8217;s legitimacy correspond to the official data?\" [he said]. Galyamov believes that the overwhelming majority of Russians, both inside the country and abroad, think the entire process of the vote is falsified.&#160;\n\n\"It is too clear to everyone, since even in the beginning stage of preparing for the election, not one single alternative candidate has been allowed. There is noone among those allowed to run who has spoken out against the war. The authorities have completely removed people&#8217;s choice since the issue of the war is the main issue on the Russian political agenda\", the expert said.\n\nThe pundit explains that candidates like [Yekaterina] Duntsova or [Boris] Nadezhdin not being allowed to run by sayings that the Kremlin, looking over its shoulder at Belarus, tried to avoid mistakes made there and did not allow anyone to run who could become a Russian Tsikhanowskaya.\n\nGalyamov noted he was certain events would develop in that way.&#160;\n\n\"They saw what can happen with the example of [Belarusian former presidential candidate Svyatlana] Tsikhanowskaya. Those in the Kremlin understand that if a candidate were running with a specifically anti-war position, then no matter what their personal qualities were, Putin would have no chance\", the expert said.&#160;\n\nIn his opinion, about one-third of Russians were against the war initially, but now a large number of people disappointed in or simply tired of the war have joined them.\n\n\"So it was clear from the very beginning that the Kremlin would not allow any anti-war candidate to run, so as not to see a repeat of the Tsikhanowskaya phenomenon\".\n\nSpeaking of changes Russia can expect after the vote, the pundit listed growth in discontent, increased suppression and a possible new wave of mobilisation. In terms of repression, Galyamov said Putin behaves more flexibly and intelligently than [Belarusian President Alyaksandr] Lukashenka [Alexander Lukashenko].\n\n\"He understands that that path is a dead end and will try to take as few steps as possible on it until the very end, attempting to get by without employing repression and using it only where ends cannot be met without it.\n\n\"In contrast to Putin, Lukashenka immediately started on that path. But it was easier for him, since even without legitimacy, Lukashenka still has Putin to help him. But Putin does not have his own Putin like that\".\n\nAs far as the likelihood of protest is concerned, Galyamov noted that there is not enough mass discontent for it to begin: \"There has to be a sense that the regime is weak, a sense that the protest will not be in vain. In a situation when you cannot expect anything from a protest except repression, there will be no protest\".\n\nAt the same time, Galyamov said: \"If, for example, the protest 'Noon against Putin' really does become massive, then the result will be a sharp decrease in his legitimacy. You could say it has been 'limping on one leg' until now. There was a sense that the president was doing something not quite right, but at the same time, the majority understood that he had the right to his post.\n\n\"After this election, his legitimacy will probably 'limp' on two legs. It is likely that not only will the sense of our not liking the course he takes increase, but that he will lose the right to speak in the name of the people. After this current election, the opinion could form that he does not have the right to speak for 150m Russian citizens and that he is not a president elected by all of the people, but a usurper\", the expert said.\n\nHe said that if events unfolded in that way, it would significantly weaken Putin&#8217;s position. Including his relationship with the elite. \"In situations like these, there are conspiracies, mutinies in the military and coups. And so although the situation will formally remain the same, its content will change\", Galyamov said.&#160;\n\nBut nothing will change for Belarus\n\nAs far as Belarus is concerned, the Russian pundit said one should not expect any changes in relations with our country after the election in the Russian Federation.&#160;\n\nAlyaksandr Klaskowski, an analyst with the Pozirk agency, believes one should not expect any surprises from the presidential election in Russia. Klaskowski said the Russian opposition&#8217;s plan for the \"Noon against Putin\" protest is a weak strategy: \"The mechanism for falsifying the election in Russia is as well worked out as in Belarus, so we can only be talking about Putin being reelected, and his simply 'sealing' a new term for himself\".\n\nPutin&#8217;s being elected to a new term does not change anything for Belarus overall, or for Lukashenka in particular. \"I think that for Lukashenka, Putin&#8217;s being reelected will have political consequences, since he will get an indirect carte blanche for his own reelection. If you imagine Putin naming his own successor, then the Kremlin could pose questions to Lukashenka. But if Putin gets a new term, then the field of play is open for Lukashenka, and he will have no psychological barriers\".\n\nThe analyst said Putin and Lukashenka currently have a good relationship. And the Kremlin only really had thoughts of replacing Lukashenka in 2020 when Moscow, during the mass protests, thought Belarus would not be able to get out of its political crisis.\n\n\"But Lukashenka cemented the situation using repression. Besides that, Putin started a full-scale war against Ukraine, one in which Lukashenka acted as an ally\", Klaskowski said.\n\nIn his opinion, the Kremlin is quite satisfied with Lukashenka right now and does not intend to change horses midstream. Klaskowski does not think Putin will want to absorb Belarus after the election as a consolation prize for the lack of large successes in Ukraine: \"Belarus&#8217;s dependence on Russia is growing bit by bit without that, and that is probably satisfactory to the Kremlin. And it can also be used well as a counter to Ukraine. As if to say, see, if you are friends with Russia, everything will be good.\"\n\nThe original article can be found and read here.\n\nSource: Nasha Niva, Minsk, in Russian 0859 GMT 13 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.2859928922833137,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia (also referred to as \"Russian Federation\")\n*   Belarus\n*   Kremlin (a specific location within Moscow, Russia)\n*   Moscow\n*   Ukraine\n*   Minsk"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-68.15762329101563}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.540561Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daZH_IOD61PIP1vf88Ao","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5285},"candidatesTokenCount":53,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":53}],"promptTokenCount":1437,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1437}],"thoughtsTokenCount":791,"totalTokenCount":2281,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.650319+00:00"}

It means recognizing mutual rights and also mutual duties, above all, taking into account the dignity of people.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Francis’ sometimes imprecise way of speaking, which is often appreciated in other contexts because of its simplicity, have created a diplomatic headache for the Holy See and angered one or the other side in the war.\n\nHe has repeatedly expressed solidarity with the “martyred” Ukrainian people but refused to call out Russia or President Vladimir Putin by name. He has seemingly expressed understanding for the invasion Putin ordered by saying NATO was “barking at Russia’s door” by expanding east, but then earned a formal protest from Moscow when he blamed most of the cruelty on Chechens and other minorities.\n\nIn September, Francis again courted the displeasure of Ukrainians, including its Greek Catholic bishops, when he praised Russia’s imperial past during a meeting with Russian youths. After Ukrainians voiced their sense of betrayal, Francis later acknowledged his words were “perhaps not happy” and that he in no way meant to justify Russia’s invasion.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.6569595336914063,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":791,"startIndex":482,"uri":"https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/vatican-diplomats-seek-defuse-outrage-over-pope-francis-ukraine-white-flag"},{"endIndex":1177,"startIndex":911,"uri":"https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/vatican-diplomats-seek-defuse-outrage-over-pope-francis-ukraine-white-flag"},{"endIndex":1669,"startIndex":1450,"uri":"https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/vatican-diplomats-seek-defuse-outrage-over-pope-francis-ukraine-white-flag"},{"endIndex":2022,"startIndex":1721,"uri":"https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/vatican-diplomats-seek-defuse-outrage-over-pope-francis-ukraine-white-flag"},{"endIndex":2596,"startIndex":2382,"uri":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/vatican-diplomats-seek-defuse-popes-124314710.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Vatican\n*   Holy See\n*   Italy\n*   Russia\n*   Moscow"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-57.99358367919922}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.232849Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daZGbDsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2189},"candidatesTokenCount":35,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":35}],"promptTokenCount":533,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":533}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1141,"totalTokenCount":1709,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.351862+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: One, an older Russian woman who has lived in Latvia for 50 years, came to cast her vote for Mr. Putin in Russia’s presidential election. The other, a woman in her fifties, came to show support for the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, who before his death in an Arctic prison last month urged supporters to show up at polling stations in protest.\n\n“I think what happened to Navalny was murder,” said Alla, the younger woman, who would give only her first name.\n\n“He deserved it,” retorted the older woman, who declined to provide her name.\n\nSuch tensions show Riga, the quaint capital of Latvia, as a microcosm of the complex dynamics of Russian politics and Russian speakers’ place in the world. Latvia — which was once annexed by the Soviet Union — has long distrusted its own, partly pro-Putin Russian minority. But it also has treated with suspicion the antiwar Russians who flocked over the border after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAbout a third of Latvia’s 1.8 million residents are estimated to be ethnic Russians, most of whose ancestors came to the country after the Soviet occupation. Some of them have supported Mr. Putin’s nationalism out of nostalgia, or as a response to the perceived discrimination faced by Russian speakers in Latvia, where many were born. Many people in Latvia view the Russian-speaking minority as a fifth column for the Kremlin.\n\nMr. Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, however, has brought a new wave of thousands of Russians migrating west into Latvia. These have tended to be younger, more educated and more critical of Mr. Putin than the older diaspora.\n\nBut the Latvian government — which views the Kremlin with hostility — has been wary of fully welcoming the Russian exiles.\n\nThose dynamics were on display Sunday outside the Russian Embassy, where protest posters depicting Mr. Putin as a warmonger surrounded the stately mansion.\n\n“We must show that a great number of Russians don’t support Putin, and don’t support the war,” a former regional campaigner for Mr. Navalny, Sergei Bespalov, told supporters across the street from the embassy.\n\nThe Russian electoral commission said 11,000 people voted in Riga in 2018 during Russia’s last presidential vote. Fearing unrest this time, the Latvian police cordoned off the embassy and the border guard service deployed a helicopter above it.\n\nMigration officers also checked the documents of people who came to vote, ostensibly to see their residence status. These checks come amid a wider, politically charged campaign to deport Russian citizens who fail a Latvian language test, regardless how long they have lived in the country.\n\nThe Russian Embassy called the document checks intimidation aimed at suppressing voter turnout, which was significantly lower than in the previous election.\n\nEarlier in the voting line, the older pro-Putin voter was expounding about the hardships facing Russians in Latvia as younger, opposition-leaning voters around her rolled their eyes.\n\n“I cannot listen to these old ladies,” said one voter named Lena, who came to support Mr. Navalny protest initiative and would only give her first name. “Only Babushkas are for Putin, no one else!”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.138411181313651,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Latvia\n*   Russia\n*   Arctic (prison)\n*   Riga\n*   Soviet Union\n*   Ukraine\n*   Kremlin\n*   Russian Embassy (implied to be in Riga)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-63.75102615356445}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.498210Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daaK0HsCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2683},"candidatesTokenCount":56,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":56}],"promptTokenCount":670,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":670}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1532,"totalTokenCount":2258,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.958675+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Nadeem Malik said the government has announced constitution of a commission under the Commission of Inquiry Act to look into the issues raised in a letter by six judges of the Islamabad High Court. He noted the commission would be headed by a retired judge. He remarked Pakistan's history shows that the government forms a committee on matters it has \"no intention to take action against\" and forms a commission on matters which it wants to \"bury\". Noting that the present government has opted to form a commission, he said he would not question the government because it is \"very weak\" and is \"dependent on the [military] establishment\", but he would question why the Supreme Court did not take a suo moto notice and decided to hear the case in an open court.\n\nMalik insisted the Supreme Court should take action in this matter and there is a need to set some standard operating procedures. He said Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa has an opportunity to take action to end the interference of government and intelligence agencies in judicial matters and ensure that judges issue judgements by meeting requirements of the due process of justice.\n\nMalik spoke with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) politician Salman Akram Raja and asked him about the way forward. Raja remarked the way forward is very clear and the letter by the judges has identified it. He said allegations have been levelled against the executive and its subordinate officers, and it is clear that the executive cannot conduct an investigation against itself, so a judicial commission needs to be formed.\n\nRaja was of the view that the Supreme Court should have initiated proceedings under suo moto or contempt jurisdiction. He said not just the PTI, but all political parties should play a role in taking this matter to a \"logical conclusion\". He urged the civil society and human rights defenders to also raise their voice against this issue. He insisted the commission announced by the government on 28 March is \"insufficient\" because it would not be able to reach any conclusion and demanded that a judicial commission should be constituted. He said the judiciary should have fulfilled its responsibility in this matter, otherwise it would be considered a \"failure\" on its behalf.\n\nRaja claimed interference in judicial affairs has been present in all cases of \"political nature\" and some judges appear to be scared, while others show courage. He warned if judges are not free to give judgements without any pressure or threat, the country would not be able to progress.\n\nIndependent politician Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said as a lawyer, he is disappointed by the announcement regarding the government forming a commission because he expected the Supreme Court to take a suo moto notice in the case and hold an open proceeding. He claimed the government is just a \"rubber stamp\" and it is useless to hand this matter over to it. He noted the allegations are very serious and have raised questions over the entire judicial system.\n\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Khurram Dastgir said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stepped forward as the \"elected representative of the people\" and has taken a responsibility which does not directly fall under his duties. He noted the responsibility to take up this matter was on the judiciary because the letter had been addressed to it.\n\nDastgir said details of the allegations are yet to be gathered and the commission which has been announced should be allowed to do its work and \"prove through its conduct\" that it would take up the issue seriously. He was hopeful that the letter written by the six judges will help in \"taking Pakistan forward\". He remarked the present situation is a \"test of the political wisdom\" of all political players. He was of the view that \"partial justice\" will not work and it cannot be said that only the cases concluded in the last one year are wrong, while judgements in the earlier cases should be accepted.\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 28 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.7695249474566916,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Islamabad\n*   Pakistan\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-40.699073791503906}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:31.440173Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"X94dae3uGsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3380},"candidatesTokenCount":23,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":23}],"promptTokenCount":808,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":808}],"thoughtsTokenCount":462,"totalTokenCount":1293,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.343078+00:00"}

He added former judge Ijazul Ahsan also resigned because he \"could not get along with Chief Justice Isa\".\n\nMalik asked Khosa whether he agrees that those who had sentenced Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (former president and prime minister) to death should be posthumously sentenced after a recent verdict of the Supreme Court which stated that Bhutto was not given a fair trial. Khosa replied he \"100 per cent agrees\" with Malik and cited an example of a \"posthumous trial\" of Cromwell in Britain. He remarked Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) is another prime minister who is a \"heartthrob of the people\" and is being targeted currently and demanded justice for him. He claimed people have reacted against political victimisation of the PTI by giving it a two-thirds majority.\n\nPakistan Peoples Party (PPP) politician Palwasha Khan said other controversial cases should also be reviewed and noted many judgements of the judiciary have \"thrown Pakistan into turmoil\" and the nation is feeling their \"aftershocks\" even today. She insisted those responsible for such judgements should be held accountable.\n\nTalking about the Bhutto case, Khan said it is not possible to say that justice has been done to Bhutto as he lost his life. She was of the view that the court should have named those who had issued that unfair judgement. She added even though those people are dead, \"handcuffs could have been placed over their graves\" as a symbolic punishment.\n\nKhan said the PPP would not be affected even if the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) is given the reserved seats because the former has the required numbers to get Asif Ali Zardari (senior PPP politician) elected as the president on 9 March.\n\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Abid Sher Ali said judges should also be held accountable because their verdicts affect lives of millions of people. He remarked Naqvi was a \"dishonest\" person and had \"strangulated justice\". He argued judges like Naqvi and Ijazul Ahsan sent an elected prime minister [Nawaz Sharif] home to serve their personal interests and \"violated the sanctity of the judiciary\".\n\nResponding to Malik's question on whether reserved seats should be allotted to the SIC, Ali said if the SIC has submitted a list of candidates for reserved seats, it should be given those seats at any cost. However, he added, if it did not do so, the matter would be settled in the court. He commented the Supreme Court will not give its verdict on the basis of \"sympathy\", but according to the law and the Constitution.\n\nAli was of the view that those involved in the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of Imran Khan) of attacks on military installations and monuments of martyrs should \"never be spared\".\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 7 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.0055440266927085,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Peshawar (Peshawar High Court)\n*   Pakistan\n*   Britain\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-66.18295288085938}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.802597Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daaX-MJe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2901},"candidatesTokenCount":33,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":33}],"promptTokenCount":759,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":759}],"thoughtsTokenCount":596,"totalTokenCount":1388,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.57259+00:00"}

He added the question is whether these people should face trials in military or civilian courts. He noted while hearing the case on 25 March, the Supreme Court questioned how many people accused in the 9 May incidents have been found innocent in the military courts, and the prosecution could not answer it. He argued military courts are \"not acceptable in a democratic country\", so civilian courts should be empowered to handle such cases.\n\nMalik noted rumours of formation of a \"forward bloc\" of the PTI in the Punjab Assembly have been circulating lately. He said it is to be seen whether there is any truth in these reports.\n\nMalik spoke with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Azma Bokhari whether everyone accused in the 9 May incidents should be awarded the same sentence or some distinction should be maintained. Bokhari said according to the criminal law, punishments should be awarded according to the actions of the accused. She claimed the PTI has been denying its involvement in the incidents despite evidence.\n\nBokhari said the PTI has neither condemned, nor disassociated itself from those involved in the attacks. She noted the PTI has nominated people like Murad Saeed who have been declared \"proclaimed offenders\" in the 9 May incidents for National Assembly (lower house of the parliament) and Senate (upper house of the parliament) elections. Replying to a question on which courts should people face trials in, she said it is very clear that if someone has intruded into an airbase or the Army's headquarters, \"they cannot be tried under the Land Revenue Act\" and trials in such cases are held under the Military Act.\n\nMalik asked former Sindh governor Imran Ismail whether those involved in the 9 May incidents should face trial in military courts. Ismail said everyone, including members and leaders of the PTI, condemned the 9 May incidents. However, he added, it is the responsibility of government institutions to hold investigations and initiate trials. He expressed the view that it should be decided whether someone should be tried in a military or civilian court based on investigations.\n\nIsmail said every government in Pakistan tries to get the support of the military and security institutions, while those in the opposition criticise these institutions. He emphasised politicians should stop seeking help from the military and perform their duties on their own. He condemned the 9 May incidents and agreed that it was a \"black day\".\n\nReplying to a question on whether he would re-join the PTI, Ismail said he has not made a final decision in this regard. Responding to a question on how the current confrontation can be resolved, he said it is an ideal suggestion that all major parties should sit together and try to find a solution to the issues, but it is not happening because the government which should show flexibility seems to be \"bending backwards\" to oppose the PTI.\n\nPTI politician Zain Qureshi said what happened on 9 May should not have happened, but whether the PTI had any role in it is to be determined by the courts. He termed the 9 May incidents a \"false flag operation\" and claimed thousands of PTI workers have been put in jail without any evidence. He emphasised the legal system should not be \"politicised\" or \"weaponised\". Commenting on reports about a forward bloc in the PTI, he said all PTI members are loyal to the party and there is no truth in these rumours.\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 25 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.8906178628244708,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   **Punjab** (from \"Punjab Assembly\")\n*   **Sindh**\n*   **Pakistan**\n*   **Karachi**"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-58.609153747558594}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.061280Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daeDeA6Hp1PIPx6PS2AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3134},"candidatesTokenCount":31,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":31}],"promptTokenCount":763,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":763}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1236,"totalTokenCount":2030,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.967686+00:00"}

expires on 31 August.\n\nIsraeli families cross into Syria\n\nA group of Israeli families crossed into Syria yesterday, attempting to establish a new Jewish settlement there called \"Neve Habashan\", Israeli media reported.\n\nAccording to the right-wing, pro-settlement Arutz Sheva, the families spent an \"extended period of time\" in Syria before being evacuated back to Israel by the army.\n\nOne of the members of the \"Bashan Pioneers\" movement told Arutz Sheva that the fence was \"wide open\" and it took 30-40 minutes before Israeli forces had noticed they had crossed the border area.\n\nThe Walla news site quoted the army as calling the crossing a \"serious incident that constitutes a criminal offence and endangers the public and Israeli forces\".\n\nUS forces start Iraq withdrawal\n\nWashington has started the first phase of withdrawing forces in the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) from Iraq, as the first US convoy left the Ain al-Asad airbase in the western Anbar province yesterday, heading towards Syria.\n\nAn Iraqi military spokesman described the move as an \"indicator of Iraq's ability to confront terrorism and maintain security and stability without needing assistance from others\", according to the official news agency INA.\n\nThe first phase is scheduled to end by late September, with US troops and equipment due to be redeployed to Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region or to Kuwait.\n\nBy September 2026, the US will complete its military exit, reducing its troop numbers from around 2,000 to fewer than 500.\n\n'Catastrophic' flooding hits southern Yemen\n\nYemeni media have reported that flooding from heavy rain overnight has brought parts of the southern city of Aden - the temporary capital of the internationally recognised government - to a standstill this morning.\n\nSouthern Yemen-focused Aden al-Ghad called the situation \"catastrophic\", saying floods had swept large quantities of debris on to main roads in the city's Mualla district and had submerged vehicles.\n\nIt said residents had criticised a lack of emergency response and poor drainage systems.\n\nThe leading Al-Masdar Online website said residents had been evacuated from damaged homes in the city's Crater district, and that several flights into Aden had been diverted.\n\nFlooding across Yemen last year caused widespread devastation, with some media blaming the extent of the damage on corruption and neglect by the internationally recognised government.\n\nHadramawt protests - potential flashpoint?\n\nYemen's southeastern province of Hadramawt has become the crucible of a summer of unrest in the government-controlled south.\n\nThe Aden-based authorities have come under increasing pressure to address deteriorating economic and living conditions that have already seen months of street protests.\n\nBut weeks of protests in Hadramawt have led to fears that the province is on the brink of a military escalation that could have repercussions for the country as a whole.\n\nThe protests have also highlighted underlying tensions between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over influence in Yemen.\n\nSee our Explainer: Hadramawt emerges as

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: He then mocked Mr. Biden’s lifelong stutter, a jab that set the tone for the lengthy speech that followed.\n\nOver nearly two hours, Mr. Trump lobbed sharp personal attacks at Mr. Biden’s mental and physical health and revived a litany of grievances against political opponents, prosecutors and television executives. He used inflammatory language to stoke fears about immigration, called the press “criminals” and repeated his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nMr. Trump told thousands of his supporters gathered at the rally that “everything Joe Biden touches” turns to filth, though he used an expletive to describe the result. “Everything. I tried finding a different word, but there are some words that cannot be duplicated.” (He used the word, or a variant, at least four times in his speech.)\n\nThe speech that Mr. Trump gave on Saturday was his first since Mr. Biden repeatedly attacked him and his policies in his State of the Union address. “Joe Biden should not be shouting angrily at America,” Mr. Trump said. “America should be shouting angrily at Joe Biden.”\n\nBut his critiques moved toward personal insults. At one point, Mr. Trump slurred his words and pretended to stutter in a mocking imitation of the president, who has dealt with a stutter since childhood.\n\nA Biden campaign spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, responded to Mr. Trump’s insults in a statement Sunday, contrasting the former president’s speech with Mr. Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\n“Thursday night President Biden spoke about the kind of America he wants for our future — one based on the core values of honesty, decency, dignity, and respect for everyone — values that are unrecognizable to Donald Trump. Trump thinks mocking people and taking away their rights makes him look strong. But it just reveals how weak and insecure he is.”\n\nThe former president’s speech in Georgia, a key battleground state that he narrowly lost in 2020, underscored that Mr. Trump is not likely to temper the ominous and at times apocalyptic vision that has animated his campaign, even as his last remaining Republican rival has dropped out and the general election has come into focus.\n\nAs he has in the past, Mr. Trump insisted that the biggest danger facing the United States was his political opponents, whom he labeled “the threat from within,” a turn inward that has alarmed experts for its similarity to language used by totalitarian leaders.\n\nBut in a speech replete with digressive rants, Mr. Trump reserved some of his most incendiary rhetoric to vilify migrants crossing the border illegally. Much of his speech was focused on immigration, an issue that he and his advisers have signaled will be central to his efforts to defeat Mr. Biden and return to the White House.\n\nWhile vowing to expand his crackdown on immigration, Mr. Trump described the continuing surge of migrants across the southern border as “the agony of our people, the plunder of our cities, the sacking of our towns, the violation of our citizens and the conquest of our country.”\n\nMr. Trump also took aim at Mr. Biden’s policies on immigration, in part by using the Georgia setting to blame his rival for the death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed in the state last month by, according to the authorities, a Venezuelan migrant who had entered the country illegally and had been released on parole.\n\nMr. Trump met with Ms. Riley’s parents before taking the stage, and the Trump campaign distributed signs at the rally with Ms. Riley’s photograph. During his speech, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Biden of neglecting the surge of migrants at the border, which he called a “deadly invasion that stole precious Laken’s beautiful American life.”\n\nMr. Trump often broadly casts those crossing the border illegally as violent criminals. “The migrants are hurting people,” Mr. Trump said. “They talk about the beautiful dream of migrants. It sounds so nice, you know, like in a fairy-tale book. But some of these people are monsters.”\n\nBorder authorities, including some who worked for Mr. Trump, have said that most of the migrants who cross the border are members of families fleeing violence and poverty.\n\nBut Ms. Riley’s death has become a flashpoint in the nation’s heated debate over immigration policy, in part because it seems to adhere to Mr. Trump’s long-stated belief that violent men from South America are flooding across the border to harm Americans.\n\n“He was an illegal migrant, and he shouldn’t have been in our country, and he never would have been under the Trump policy,” Mr. Trump said of the man accused of killing Ms. Riley.\n\nMr. Trump also attacked Mr. Biden for expressing regret that he used the word “illegal” to describe the man accused in Ms. Riley’s death during an exchange at the State of the Union address on Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump also lobbed several ad hominem attacks during the event. Of the former television anchor Megyn Kelly, with whom Mr. Trump sparred during his first presidential run, he said “may she rest in peace.” While talking about the success that his time on “The Apprentice” had brought NBC, he called Jeff Zucker, the network’s former chief executive, an “idiot.”\n\nMr. Trump also denigrated a number of prosecutors and judges involved in the criminal cases and multiple civil lawsuits in which he is entangled. He spent a considerable amount of time attacking Fani T. Willis, the district attorney prosecuting him over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia.\n\nMr. Trump called Ms. Willis “corrupt,” referring to allegations that she benefited financially after becoming romantically involved with a lawyer whom she hired on the case. (Ms. Willis has pushed back against those claims, calling them full of “wild and reckless speculation.”)\n\nHe also repeated his false contention that he won in Georgia in 2020, maintaining that he had done nothing wrong when he called state elections officials, insisted that he had won Georgia and asked Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” the votes he needed to win.\n\n“Perfect phone call,” Mr. Trump said, “other than we challenged the honesty of this election. This election was rigged.”\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-4.164079608339252,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1193,"startIndex":970,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/10/trump-vilifies-migrants-and-mocks-bidens-stutter-in-georgia-speech/"},{"endIndex":3121,"startIndex":2895,"uri":"https://www.sanjuandailystar.com/post/in-combative-speech-filled-with-insults-trump-vilifies-biden-and-migrants"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Georgia\n*   United States\n*   South America\n*   White House\n*   New York"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-137.4146270751953}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.168477Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94daZ2kCvDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5214},"candidatesTokenCount":33,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":33}],"promptTokenCount":1331,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1331}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1111,"totalTokenCount":2475,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.07045+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Hosting the leaders of Poland at the White House, Mr. Biden made a show of defiance not only against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who continues to wage war on Ukraine, but also, implicitly at least, against Mr. Trump, who has said he would ''encourage'' Russia to attack NATO members that do not spend enough on their militaries.\n\n''When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,'' Mr. Biden said, citing former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Czech-born diplomat who championed NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and her homeland, finalized on this day in 1999 with the support of Mr. Biden, then a senator. ''I believed that then, and I believe it now,'' he added.\n\nThe meeting with President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland marked the 25th anniversary of their country's accession to NATO, which was the beginning of a quarter-century post-Cold War expansion of the alliance into parts of Europe previously dominated by the old Soviet Union. Just this month, NATO formally welcomed Sweden, which like Finland joined in response to Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022, increasing the alliance to 32 members, up from 16 when the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nMr. Biden used the occasion to announce $300 million in additional weapons and military equipment for Ukraine, a small fraction of what he has asked Congress for but all he could squeeze out of savings from previous arms transfers without additional legislative authority. He pressed House Republican leaders to stop blocking legislation passed by the Senate for $60 billion in security aid to Ukraine, a measure that has bipartisan support and would almost surely pass if brought to the floor.\n\n''We must act before it literally is too late, before it's too late, because as Poland remembers, Russia won't stop at Ukraine,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States and the entire free world at risk.''\n\nMr. Biden praised the Polish leaders not only for investing in the alliance but also for taking in about one million Ukrainians who have fled the war. ''You're doing God's work,'' he told the leaders. ''You really are. It's incredible what you're doing, what the Polish people are doing.''\n\nHe also promised Poland a $2 billion military loan and approved the sale of 96 Apache attack helicopters to Warsaw.\n\nPoland sits on the frontline of the alliance, perpetually wary of Russian revanchism and staunchly supportive of Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, as it defends itself against Mr. Putin's forces. Poland spends more on its military as a proportion than any other member of the alliance, nearly 4 percent of its economy, twice the alliance's goal. Mr. Duda used the White House visit to propose that NATO increase its target from 2 percent of gross domestic product to 3 percent.\n\n''Other allies must take more responsibility for the security of the alliance as a whole,'' Mr. Duda said as he sat with Mr. Biden in the East Room of the White House. ''Two percent was good 10 years ago. Now 3 percent is required in response to the full-scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO's eastern border.''\n\nThe alliance's leaders agreed in 2014 to the 2 percent goal, but it was a nonbinding aspiration to meet by 2024. While several American presidents have pushed NATO to do more for its own defense, Mr. Trump was more bellicose in demanding that allies raise their military spending and spoke of it as if they owed the money to the United States, which was not true.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, the number of NATO members meeting the 2 percent goal increased to nine from six. Under Mr. Biden, it has doubled to 18, reflecting rising fear of Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The United States spends 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, and most of the other top spenders are in Eastern Europe, closer to Russia. Collectively, the European allies are spending 2 percent of their combined gross domestic product this year, or $380 billion.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden did not mention Mr. Trump by name on Tuesday, Mr. Tusk seemed to allude to comments in which the former president scoffed at the mutual defense obligation in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. ''We treat our obligations seriously, more than anyone else in Europe,'' Mr. Tusk said. ''And we hope that none of our NATO partners will undermine the most important obligation, which is Article 5 of the treaty.''\n\nThe visit by the Polish leaders was the first since a landmark election in October, when opposition parties defeated the ruling Law and Justice party, a right-wing faction accused of subverting democracy as it consolidated power over major institutions like the judiciary, the news media, the central bank and large state-controlled corporations.\n\nMr. Duda and Mr. Tusk, who was installed in December as prime minister, are fierce rivals who have clashed repeatedly at home. Mr. Duda is an ally of Law and Justice who curried favor with Mr. Trump when he was in office, while Mr. Tusk is a veteran centrist who during a previous stint as prime minister from 2007 to 2014 worked with Mr. Biden, then the vice president.\n\nTheir conflict led to a dramatic showdown in January when Mr. Duda gave shelter in the presidential palace to two former officials from his party previously convicted of abuse of power.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: “They’re the only ones saying they’re going to change the system,” said Ms. Faye, a college student.\n\nThe West African nation of Senegal votes for a new president Sunday, in an election that many young people see as a chance to overhaul the political and economic order. And it has been a nail-biting run-up.\n\nLast month, the incumbent president, Macky Sall, had called off the election with only three weeks to go. Then he agreed to hold it after all. And suddenly, last week, he released from jail the pugnacious opposition figure many see as his nemesis — Ousmane Sonko — along with the man Mr. Sonko is backing for president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye.\n\nThe whiplash-inducing twists and turns have left many Senegalese relieved that the election is happening at all, and that so far their widely lauded democracy appears to be still intact.\n\nPeople arrived early Sunday morning at polling stations across the country, forming orderly queues and waiting their turns to cast their ballots, the tranquil scenes in schoolyards and under trees standing in contrast to the drama of the previous month.\n\nThe initial turnout appeared to be high, with women, young people and older people represented. Many posted photographs on social media of their fingers stained with pink ink, indicating that they had voted.\n\nWhile there are 19 candidates in all, many experts think the election will go to a runoff between Mr. Faye and the governing party candidate, Prime Minister Amadou Ba. It is prohibited to publish opinion polls in Senegal during election season, so there is nothing concrete to indicate who is favored to win.\n\nBut ask most young people who they are supporting, and they will mention Mr. Sonko, whose name is not even on the ballot.\n\nThousands of young people flowed into the Mbour stadium to see him on Friday evening, the air filling with the honk of vuvuzelas. Binta Cissé, a 30-year-old cleaner, looked around at the sea of T-shirts bearing the faces of Mr. Sonko and his candidate, Mr. Faye, a 43-year-old former tax inspector.\n\n“We can see ourselves in them,” Ms. Cissé said.\n\nThe campaigning has happened at a breakneck pace, and during Ramadan, when most people in this predominantly Muslim country fast during the day. At night, political convoys rushed through the sandy alleyways of Dakar, the coastal capital, pumping out music and slogans and distributing fliers. Posters bearing politicians’ beaming faces were hastily pasted up on roadside billboards.\n\nThe prime minister, Mr. Ba, hurriedly quit his position to go on the campaign trail. Mr. Sonko’s protégée, Mr. Faye, immediately hit the road after getting out of jail. He had been held on defamation charges and contempt of court, after he accused magistrates of persecuting Mr. Sonko.\n\nA country on the African continent’s westernmost tip, Senegal has watched as some of its neighbors — like Mali, to the east, and Guinea, to the south — have been overtaken by coups in recent years.\n\nBut Senegal, observers say, is different.\n\nIt has never had a coup d’état. The country’s powerful Sufi brotherhoods — Muslim communities guided by revered spiritual leaders — are seen as a stabilizing force. Its military prides itself on staying out of politics.\n\nExperts say that while Senegal has been badly damaged by Mr. Sall’s authoritarian turn, the country’s reputation as a democratic outpost in a crisis-hit region has held.\n\nBut Senegal faces many of the same problems that have bedeviled its neighbors in West Africa — such as persistent poverty, an education deficit and a lack of jobs, particularly for young people. These are the issues this election is likely to turn on — and a major reason Mr. Sonko has garnered such a strong youth following.\n\nOver the last decade, 35-year-old Lamine Ndao has watched Senegal’s economy grow under Mr. Sall’s administration — large oil and gas fields have recently been discovered, and major infrastructure projects completed. But he has been left behind, he said.\n\nFor 10 years, ever since he received a degree in tourism from a university in Dakar, he’s been looking for a job. And most of his friends are in the same situation, he said — except the ones who joined the political party in power.\n\n“If you have political connections, you can work,” he said as he watched gleaming SUV’s drive by on one of Dakar’s busiest roads a few days before the election. “Do you find that fair? It’s not.”\n\nYoung people like Mr. Ndao were pivotal in assuring Mr. Sall’s ascent to the presidency.\n\nMr. Sall’s predecessor, Abdoulaye Wade, began as a stalwart defender of democracy who promised change and ran for president four times before he was elected — twice. Then he ran for a third term in 2012, arguing that the constitutional two-term limit did not apply to him. But a lively youth movement persuaded hundreds of thousands of young Senegalese to head to the polls, and Mr. Wade lost to Mr. Sall.\n\nTwelve years later, this February, many Senegalese said they were astounded to see Mr. Sall try to call off the election. They were also stunned to see the scenes from Parliament, where the police threw out opposition lawmakers so that the bill confirming the cancellation could be pushed through.\n\nMr. Ndao, the unemployed college graduate, voted for Mr. Sall in 2012. In 2019, he said he felt so disillusioned that he didn’t bother to vote. He said that while he wants to build his life in Senegal, he has been considering risking his life on a rickety boat to Europe, or following the thousands of West Africans now trying to migrate to the United States on circuitous routes via Nicaragua.\n\nHe hoped it wouldn’t come to that, he said: He and all his friends are pinning their hopes on the man who has made a career out of excoriating elites, accusing prominent politicians of corruption and promising change: Mr. Sonko.\n\nNobody can vote for Mr. Sonko, who was barred from running after being convicted of defamation and of corrupting a minor, after a young massage parlor employee accused him of rape. So they will vote for Mr. Faye instead, Mr. Ndao said.\n\nAs the light faded over Ouakam, a Dakar suburb, on Tuesday evening, young volunteers from Mr. Sonko’s party handed out free dates and coffee to Muslims breaking the fast.\n\nBassirou Faye, a 24-year-old bus driver who coincidentally shares the name of the presidential candidate for Mr. Sonko’s party, said that he wasn’t interested in Mr. Sonko at all in the 2019 election. Mr. Sonko came in third, with 16 percent of the vote.\n\nBut this time, Mr. Faye said, he will travel the 100 miles to his home city of Bambey just to vote for Mr. Sonko’s candidate.\n\n“Because of all the injustice he has faced, I started following and supporting him,” he said.\n\nMr. Faye and Mr. Sonko have promised major economic changes, like renegotiating oil and gas contracts, and reforming or leaving the regional currency, which is pegged to the euro.\n\nAnalysts say this may scare Senegal’s foreign investors and stall economic progress.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Ba said he was a safe pair of hands who would continue on the same steady trajectory as Mr. Sall, whom many perceive as having overseen orderly progress.\n\n“He’s calm and serene,” said Valéry Kalidou Bonang, 35, an entrepreneur from Kedougou, in Senegal’s east. He said he wanted to see the continuation of Mr. Sall’s program of building infrastructure and improving living conditions, known as Emerging Senegal. “But it’s not a question of the person. It’s a question of the project.”\n\nMr. Ndao, the tourism graduate, said his father was voting for Mr. Ba, along with many older people who would get up early and go vote, he said, while many young people did not even have voters’ cards.\n\n“Young people are the ones who need change,” he said. “The old ones are on their way out.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6009164333343506,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1393,"startIndex":520,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":1763,"startIndex":1530,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240325/281621015334353"},{"endIndex":5152,"startIndex":1871,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":5820,"startIndex":5157,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":7328,"startIndex":5826,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":8045,"startIndex":7334,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":8648,"startIndex":8060,"title":"Your prompt"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Senegal\n*   West Africa\n*   Mbour stadium\n*   Dakar\n*   African continent’s westernmost tip\n*   Mali\n*   Guinea\n*   Europe\n*   United States\n*   Nicaragua\n*   Ouakam (a Dakar suburb)\n*   Bambey\n*   Kedougou"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-48.07331466674805}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.152764Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4dabypCcCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6463},"candidatesTokenCount":80,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":80}],"promptTokenCount":1780,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1780}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2276,"totalTokenCount":4136,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.022686+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: “The government that I lead will withdraw immediately after the installation of this council,” Prime Minister Ariel Henry said in a speech posted on social media. Referring to the chaos in Haiti, he said, “It hurts us and it revolts us to see all these people dying. The government that I lead cannot remain insensitive to this situation.”\n\nBut it was far from clear when Mr. Henry, who had been under growing pressure to step down both in Haiti and abroad, would actually do so.\n\nLeaders from Caribbean nations, who have led the push to create a transitional council, met for discussions in Jamaica on Monday but said no plan had been finalized. Guyana’s president, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, who leads Caricom, a union of 15 Caribbean countries, said that “we still have a long way to go.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who attended the meeting in Kingston, Jamaica’s capital, announcedthat the United States would provide an additional $100 million in aid toward a United Nations-backed multinational security mission planned to deploy to Haiti. He also pledged an additional $33 million in humanitarian aid, bringing the U.S. commitments to $333 million.\n\n“We can help. We can help restore a foundation of security,” Mr. Blinken said. “Only the Haitian people can, and only the Haitian people should determine their own future, not anyone else.”\n\nMr. Henry left Haiti for Kenya in early March to finalize an agreement for the multinational force, led by the East African nation, to deploy and take on the gangs. Since then, he has been stranded outside his country while gang members wreak havoc and demand his resignation.\n\nMr. Henry, who has been staying in Puerto Rico, did not attend Monday’s meeting, and it was unclear if he had taken part remotely in the discussion.\n\nAfter months of delays, Haiti and Kenya signed an agreement this month to move forward with the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to the Caribbean nation. President William Ruto of Kenya said his country had a “historic duty” to press ahead because “peace in Haiti is good for the world as a whole.”\n\nKenya’s interior minister, Kithure Kindiki, announced Monday that the mission was in the “predeployment stage” and that all other programs and enforcement measures related to the deployment were already in place.\n\nSo far, however, there is no clear timeline for when the multinational force will deploy.\n\n“We are deeply distressed that it is already too late for too many who have lost far too much at the hands of criminal gangs,” said Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica. “The fear of the situation in Haiti worsening to become a civil war is now a real one. We are all agreed that this cannot be allowed to happen, not in our hemisphere.”\n\nHaiti has spiraled into a state of extreme unrest since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 led to widespread gang violence. To date, the country has no president nor any other elected national officials.\n\nMr. Henry was sworn in as prime minister only two weeks after Mr. Moïse’s killing. But Haitians have not yet been able to choose a democratically elected successor.\n\nThe current unrest is on a scale not seen in decades. The recent escalation of violence, gang attacks on police stations and even coordinated assaults on two prisons have left Haitians to deal with a humanitarian disaster as access to food, water and health care has been severely curtailed.\n\nOver the weekend, U.S. forces evacuated nonessential U.S. citizen workers from the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and added more security personnel, according to a statement from the Defense Department’s Southern Command. It said no Haitians were included in the airlift.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9435073534647623,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":842,"startIndex":517,"uri":"https://luxurioushirt.com/product/official-2024-donut-squad-jimmyboi-shirt/"},{"endIndex":1413,"startIndex":1189,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/kenya-hits-pause-on-police-deployment-to-haiti/"},{"endIndex":2012,"startIndex":1771,"uri":"https://new.finalcall.com/2024/04/08/the-multi-dimensional-challenges-facing-haiti/"},{"endIndex":2958,"startIndex":2739,"uri":"https://luxurioushirt.com/product/official-big-stoke-big-bidness-bawssten-shirt/"},{"endIndex":3606,"startIndex":3277,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/11/u-s-pledges-another-130-million-to-restore-order-to-haiti/"},{"endIndex":3993,"startIndex":3780,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/11/u-s-pledges-another-130-million-to-restore-order-to-haiti/"},{"endIndex":4265,"startIndex":4052,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/11/u-s-pledges-another-130-million-to-restore-order-to-haiti/"},{"endIndex":4876,"startIndex":4654,"uri":"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Talk:Ariel_Henry"},{"endIndex":5468,"startIndex":5242,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/11/u-s-pledges-another-130-million-to-restore-order-to-haiti/"},{"endIndex":5836,"startIndex":5546,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/11/u-s-pledges-another-130-million-to-restore-order-to-haiti/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Haiti\n*   Caribbean nations (or Caribbean)\n*   Jamaica\n*   Guyana\n*   Kingston\n*   United States (or U.S.)\n*   Kenya\n*   East African nation (referring to Kenya)\n*   Puerto Rico\n*   Hemisphere\n*   Port-au-Prince\n*   U.S. Embassy (in Port-au-Prince)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-90.57670593261719}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.873502Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daZ6oNeuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3108},"candidatesTokenCount":96,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":96}],"promptTokenCount":805,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":805}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1607,"totalTokenCount":2508,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.849826+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Narendra Modi, over his 10 years as prime minister, has made it his mission to turn a complex and diverse country of 1.4 billion people into something approaching a monolith dominated by his sweeping Hindu nationalist vision.\n\nThe news media, the national legislature, civil society, sometimes even the courts — all have largely been bent to his will. But one critical group of holdouts remains: some of India’s richest states, the engine of its rapid growth.\n\nThe future shape of the world’s largest democracy — and its economic trajectory — may rest on the power struggle that has ensued.\n\nMr. Modi, who is well placed to win a third term in a national election that will begin on April 19, is wielding an increasingly heavy hand in what his opponents call an unfair effort to drive out the governments of the states his party does not control.\n\nThey accuse Mr. Modi’s administration of delaying federal money for major projects; of jailing or hounding opposition leaders while shielding anyone who joins the prime minister’s party; of obstructing the delivery of basic services; and of throwing state politics into chaos.\n\nThe tensions are tearing at India’s delicate federal formula of power sharing and political competition, the glue holding the country together across 28 states and eight territories.\n\nRegional leaders have described the behavior of the central government, which holds more power than in federal systems like the United States’, as that of a colonial overlord. In the south, the most developed and innovative part of India, officials have spoken of a “separate nation” for their region if the “patterns of injustice” continue.\n\nMr. Modi and his lieutenants have in turn accused the state leaders of harboring a “separatist mind-set” and pursuing politics that could “break the nation.”\n\nIndia’s move toward more centralized governance could hurt its overall growth, analysts say, as such efforts have done in the past. Big national spending programs focus on basic development problems that the south mostly solved decades ago. If that region’s freedom to make investments based on its own needs is restricted, the effects could be far-reaching.\n\n“It is ultimately self-destructive,” said P. Thiaga Rajan, a cabinet minister in the government of the southern state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nMr. Modi offers a simple solution: for the states governed by parties other than his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., to come on board.\n\nHe often draws on automotive terminology to make his pitch. Those states, he says, could benefit from what he calls a “double engine” government, with one party — his own — working in sync at both the national and state levels.\n\nIf they do not comply, the states get wrench after wrench thrown into the works of their governments, officials say, making it difficult for them to deliver on election promises. The B.J.P., relentlessly expanding its base, waits in the wings.\n\nLast month, the chief ministers of about a half-dozen states staged a dramatic demonstration near the seat of federal power in New Delhi.\n\nWith posters reading, “Our Blood, Our Sweat, Our Tax,” hanging behind them, they complained that Mr. Modi was using his outsize control over the distribution of revenues collected across India to entrench his party and hobble their own state governments.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Modi was on a final lap of the country before the announcement of the election dates. In opposition states, he combined promises of billions of dollars in infrastructure and welfare projects with scathing criticism of the local parties.\n\nThey are scathing of him, too. They have repeatedly sued state governors appointed by New Delhi, who hold largely ceremonial roles, over complaints that they are stalling the work of elected governments.\n\n“You’re playing with fire,” India’s chief justice, Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud, told the central government after the governor in the opposition-controlled state of Punjab repeatedly prevented legislative work. “Will we continue to be a parliamentary democracy?”\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, officials said they were struggling to expand a subway line in the capital city, Chennai, because Mr. Modi’s administration was dragging its feet on New Delhi’s share of the funding.\n\nIn Kerala, on India’s southwestern coast, the state government is suing the Modi administration over what it says are arbitrary borrowing limits that have thrown the state’s budget into disarray and delayed payments.\n\nIn the western state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, India’s financial and entertainment capital, Mr. Modi’s officials have splintered the state’s two largest parties through a mix of pressure from investigative agencies and offers of incentives. Such “smash and grab” politics, as critics have branded it, has paved the way for the B.J.P. to emerge as a kingmaker in a coalition government.\n\nIn the Delhi capital region, the B.J.P. appears hellbent on destroying a smaller party that swept to power promising to improve basic services. The territory’s elected government has been stripped of important powers, and federal agencies have bogged down the top leaders of the party, Aam Aadmi, in corruption cases.\n\nThe party’s deputy leader and a key cabinet minister have been in jail for over a year. On Thursday, in a dramatic nighttime raid, government agents arrested Arvind Kejriwal, the party’s leader and Delhi’s chief minister, whom they have accused of financial crimes. He is the first serving chief minister to be arrested.\n\nThe bitter political dispute in Delhi is evident in overflowing sewage in parts of the city and long lines outside government hospitals.\n\nAam Aadmi sought to improve hospitals in part by relying on outside contractors to enter patient data. But the plan has been caught in the crossfire between Mr. Modi’s officials and the territory’s elected government, and the contractors pulled their staff from many hospitals after salaries were delayed for months.\n\n“In their political fighting, it is the public that suffers,” said Adit Kumar, a cloth-seller who has diabetes, who, along with his wife, was waiting outside a crowded hospital in New Delhi one recent day.\n\nSaurabh Bhardwaj, an Aam Aadmi official in Delhi, said Mr. Modi’s intention was clear: to push the country toward one-party rule.\n\n“You reduced the state government’s work so much that people start saying that it’s better to bring the B.J.P. and only they can deliver,” Mr. Bhardwaj said. “That means the federal structure will collapse.”\n\nThe biggest federal-state fault line pits the more prosperous south against Mr. Modi’s support base in the north.\n\nExcept for a brief period in the state of Karnataka when the B.J.P. took control by orchestrating defections, the party has been unable to win power in the five southern states.\n\nOfficials there say that Mr. Modi is trying to hold them back for their refusal to buy in to his brand of politics, including his party’s stirring of Hindu-Muslim tensions and its push to make Hindi — which is not widely spoken in the south — a national language.\n\nThe resentment is amplified by complaints that the south gets proportionally less in return for the tax money it sends to New Delhi. Because the northern states have large populations and are far behind in basic development, they get a larger share of the revenues.\n\nThere are also serious concerns in the south that the redistribution of parliamentary seats once a long-delayed national census is finally held will punish the south for its success in reducing birthrates, a key to its relative affluence.\n\nWith its earlier investments in infrastructure, education and public health — the result of a unique mix of political, cultural and historical differences in the south — the region is better placed to propel India’s ambition for high-end manufacturing. Mr. Modi’s politics-driven approach, his opponents say, could undercut his ambitions for building India into a major economic power.\n\nThe federal finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, rejected claims that revenues were being unfairly distributed, saying the central government was “releasing, and releasing on time,” the states’ share.\n\n“We want every part of the country to prosper,” Mr. Modi said in Parliament after the state leaders’ protest in New Delhi, casting himself as a strong proponent of “competitive, cooperative federalism.”\n\nIn pressuring state governments, analysts say, Mr. Modi is simply exploiting structural flaws in India’s Constitution, which created a republic — a quasi-federal union of states — after the British left in 1947.\n\nThe Indian National Congress party, which ruled over India uncontested in the first decades after independence, abused the outsize constitutional powers given to the central government over fiscal matters to quash the rise of competitors.\n\nStarting in the late 1980s, however, the decline of Congress ushered in an era of coalition politics, with regional parties finding representation in New Delhi.\n\nThis was also the period when India opened its heavily centralized economy to the free market. As growth followed, the distribution of resources was subject to more push and pull between the central and state governments.\n\n“The emergence of regional powers made the center commit to certain principles,” said Kalaiyarasan A., an assistant professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies. “The 1990s was a golden period of federalism.”\n\nToday, Mr. Modi is seeking to remake Indian federalism with his “double engine” push.\n\nIn opposition-held states, Mr. Modi has offered infrastructure and welfare projects, branded with his name or that of his office, to pitch himself as India’s only driver of development and growth.\n\nIn engaging in joint projects, the state parties face a political cost: They will get the money only if they agree to the Modi branding.\n\nAnd if they resist?\n\nIn 2022, Ms. Sitharaman, the finance minister, stopped at a shop in the southern state of Telangana that distributed rice rations as part of a joint program in which the central government provided the larger share of the funding.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Dmytro Lykhovii, a spokesman for Ukrainian forces fighting in the area, said the Ukrainians were “maneuvering” and “sometimes withdrawing to more advantageous positions and sometimes repelling enemy advances.”\n\nHe also said military commanders had set up a backup logistical route to the town to transport much needed supplies to Ukraine’s beleaguered troops.\n\nThe battle, Mr. Lykhovii said, was dynamic and changing by the hour as the two sides engaged in fierce urban combat. But his comments suggested the fighting had taken another ominous turn for Kyiv’s forces, potentially presaging their withdrawal from a town reduced to ruins by months of horrendous bombardment.\n\nIn a war of mostly small territorial gains, the capture of Avdiivka would be the Russians’ most significant battlefield achievement since taking Bakhmut last May.\n\nSigns of Ukraine’s deteriorating hold on Avdiivka have been evident for several weeks. Ukraine recently rotated out soldiers from the 110th Brigade, which had played a vital role in the defense of the city for two years but were exhausted and severely depleted after months of brutal combat. Soldiers from the elite Third Assault Brigade were sent in to shore up Ukraine’s forces but noted that they were being sent into a situation that was already “extremely critical.”\n\n“Avdiivka is hell,” the brigade’s commander, Andrii Biletskyi, said in a statement. The situation in the city was “ precarious and unstable,” he said, with the Russians able to rotate troops and deploy more resources to the fight.\n\n“We are forced to fight 360 degrees against new brigades that the enemy is deploying,” he said.\n\nAvdiivka, which is less than 10 miles from the Russian occupied city of Donetsk, has withstood months of relentless Russian assaults aimed at encircling the stronghold.\n\nHowever, as U.S. military assistance stopped flowing and commanders were forced to start rationing ammunition, the Russians managed to gain two footholds within the town itself.\n\nAs Russian warplanes pounded Avdiivka with powerful guided bombs, its small assault units stormed through the ruins. The Ukrainians have turned to drones to help thwart Russian advances. But a recent stretch of foggy and rainy weather has limited the use of drones by both sides.\n\nWith the Ukrainians forced to conserve ammunition, small bands of Russian assault units were able to amass within the city itself.\n\n“The Russians are throwing everything they have left just to symbolically take the city,” a Ukrainian soldier said when reached by phone, insisting on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “From a strategic point of view, the city no longer matters. And it’s only advantageous for us to hold it to make the losses for the Russkies as high as possible.\n\nAnother soldier fighting in the city said it was “just horrible” and the “only thing to do is pray.”\n\nThe Russian units are now advancing from the south, threatening to cut off Ukrainian forces in the southern part of city, and the north, where they have now crossed a key supply line in several places.\n\n“The supply and evacuation of Avdiivka has become challenging, but an alternative logistics route, prepared in advance, has been activated,” Mr. Lykhovii said.\n\nThe Russians’ ultimate goal, he said, is to encircle the hulking Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, which could be used by Ukrainian forces to mount a last stand in the city should they be forced to pull out of residential areas entirely.\n\nUkraine’s new top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, is under close scrutiny for how he handles Avdiivka. While military analysts agree that Ukraine has inflicted far steeper losses on the Russians than it suffered during months of fighting, the urban combat that typifies the endgame can be far more costly for both sides.\n\nIn the nine-month long fight for Bakhmut, it was the final bloody months of fighting across a bombed-out city that took the heaviest toll on both sides. General Syrsky was widely criticized for ordering his soldiers to fight inside the city long after it was clear Bakhmut would be lost. The fight for Avdiivka, a small city of 30,000 before the war but now just lifeless ruins spread across 12 square miles, has only recently descended into street fighting.\n\nAt the same time as General Syrsky has to establish trust at home, he has to plan for the future unsure what assistance his forces will get from their chief military backer, the United States.\n\nA bill that would provide $60 billion in urgently needed military assistance is facing stiff resistance from Republicans in the House of Representatives.\n\n“Avdiivka is at risk of falling under Russian control,” John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters on Thursday. “In very large part, this is happening because the Ukrainian forces on the ground are running out of artillery ammunition.”\n\nThe failure of Congress to deliver a new $60 billion aid package, he said, was being paid for by Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield.\n\n“The cost of inaction by the Congress is stark,” he said. “Russian forces are now reaching the Ukrainian trenches actually in Avdiivka and are beginning to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses.”\n\nRussia launched another wave of 26 ballistic and cruise missiles at cities across Ukraine early Thursday. Ukrainian air defense teams were only able to shoot down 50 percent of the barrage, a sign that decreased air defense capabilities were taking a toll.\n\n“We need additional missiles or systems to continue conducting effective air defense battles,” Yuri Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said after the attack. “We need missiles not only to destroy Russia’s cruise or ballistic missiles but also to deter Russian aviation from approaching Ukrainian-controlled territory.”\n\nMaria Varenikova and Liubov Sholudko contributed reporting from Kyiv.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.2528191238153177,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1403,"startIndex":1094,"uri":"https://arabyada.online/2024/02/15/losing-ground-ukraine-seeks-new-positions-around-avdiivka/"},{"endIndex":1949,"startIndex":1661,"uri":"http://inforos.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=163534"},{"endIndex":2441,"startIndex":2229,"uri":"https://arabyada.online/2024/02/15/losing-ground-ukraine-seeks-new-positions-around-avdiivka/"},{"endIndex":3355,"startIndex":3077,"uri":"https://arabyada.online/2024/02/15/losing-ground-ukraine-seeks-new-positions-around-avdiivka/"},{"endIndex":3857,"startIndex":3625,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":3992,"startIndex":3755,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":4815,"startIndex":4611,"uri":"https://arabyada.online/2024/02/15/losing-ground-ukraine-seeks-new-positions-around-avdiivka/"},{"endIndex":5302,"startIndex":4975,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":5802,"startIndex":5346,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":6544,"startIndex":6304,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":7176,"startIndex":6921,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":7500,"startIndex":7216,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/02/15/losing-ground-in-the-war-ukraine-seeks-new-position-around-avdiivka-mashaher/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Kyiv\n*   Avdiivka\n*   Bakhmut\n*   Ukraine\n*   Donetsk\n*   Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant\n*   United States\n*   Russia\n*   Ukrainian-controlled territory"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-76.42196655273438}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.541538Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daeKGIcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4946},"candidatesTokenCount":61,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":61}],"promptTokenCount":1217,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1217}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1988,"totalTokenCount":3266,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:48.925926+00:00"}

Mufti said one can only hope that the government will at least fulfil its promise on this matter because it will be a huge relief to the people here. Taking to a US-based micro-blogging website, Mufti said, \"PDP has consistently called for the repeal of the stringent AFSPA with gradual withdrawal of troops. It also formed an important part of our agenda of alliance to which the BJP wholeheartedly agreed.\" She said, \"Better late than never, but only if it's not gibberish like creating two crore [20 million] jobs every year or empty promises of depositing 15 lakhs [$18,000] in bank accounts.\" She added, \"One can only hope that they fulfil their commitment at least in this case since it would bring a huge relief to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The announcement came after thousands of physicians, nurses and other medical professionals took to the streets on Sunday, rallying with banners that read: “Doctors are not criminals!”\n\nFor more than a month, young doctors have been in a high-stakes dispute with the government over the future of health care in the country. Nearly 10,000 interns and residents, about a tenth of all doctors in the nation, have walked off the job, with most ignoring a Thursday deadline to return to work. On Monday, the government said it would begin to suspend the licenses of around 7,000 of those doctors.\n\nBut two weeks after the walkout, it remains unclear how the disagreement will be resolved.\n\n“Why would we want to go back after the government has treated us like the bad guys and has not addressed our demands?” said Lee Haeju, 32, who until recently was a resident at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nDr. Lee — who said that she was so sleep deprived during her first year of residency that she felt like she operated on a 48-hour cycle instead of 24 — and her cohort have long complained about the pressures they face.\n\nThey say some of them do not even make minimum wage, their work conditions are Dickensian and that they are overburdened by complaints from litigation-happy patients. The authorities, they say, have long ignored systemic issues that made specializations like dermatology and cosmetic surgery more lucrative than essential services like emergency care.\n\nLast month, the government issued a new health care policy that it said would address a longstanding shortage of doctors by increasing medical school admissions by about 65 percent a year. But interns and residents, known as trainee doctors, said the government was continuing to ignore the real issues facing doctors.\n\n“How many people would actually work in our department?” said Dr. Lee, who specializes in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery.\n\nSurveys show widespread public support for increasing medical school admissions, the quota for which was last raised in 2006. The government points to statistics that show South Korea has one of the fewest doctors per capita in the developed world. And it says that increasing the number of doctors is crucial in a country with a rapidly aging society.\n\nFacing legal threats, hundreds of trainee doctors have returned to work, but the vast majority of them continue to protest.\n\nThe orders were issued to “prevent serious hazards posed by the collective actions of trainee doctors,” Cho Kyoo-hong, the health minister, said in a written reply to questions.\n\nUnder South Korean law, the government can force some doctors back to work to avoid a disruption of care. Violators may face a fine of up to 30 million won ($22,000) or jail time of up to three years.\n\nFor now, patients have been directed to smaller hospitals and clinics. Major hospitals have had up to half of their operations delayed, and nurses have been allowed to assume some of the duties of doctors. The government has opened military hospitals and increased operating times for public clinics, and while there have been disruptions, the health system has not buckled.\n\nTrainee doctors are a crucial cog in the medical system in South Korea. In major hospitals, they often make up a third of staff and often are the first caregivers to attend to patients.\n\nPark Dan, 33, said he wanted to be an emergency room doctor to save lives. As a resident at Severance Hospital in Seoul, one of South Korea’s biggest hospitals, he said he worked 100-hour weeks, often saw 20 patients every 60 minutes, and had to hold off going to the bathroom for hours on end.\n\n“I thought my own life might be cut short in my effort to save others,” said Mr. Park, who is also the head of the Korean Intern Resident Association.\n\nSouth Korea has a universal health care system that provides care for all citizens. But doctors argue that the government has underinvested in essential services, making specializations like emergency care and pediatrics less financially appealing to physicians. The government has said it would spend about 10 trillion won, or $7.5 billion, on essential health services over the next five years.\n\nEarly-career doctors in South Korea typically work longer weeks and earn less than their counterparts in the United States. Interns and residents make about $3,000 a month, which is less than minimum wage, considering their long workweeks, according to Lee Jaehee, a lawyer who is representing some of the doctors who have walked out. Their shifts cap out at 36 hours, and their workweek can stretch to 88 hours.\n\nFor trainee doctors, the situation is “similar to the Industrial Revolution when young boys and girls were forced to work in factories,” said Dr. Lim Hyun Taek, the president of the Korean Pediatric Association.\n\nThis is not the first time doctors have protested a government plan to increase the medical school admissions quota. In 2020, a monthlong strike by doctors forced the authorities to shelve a similar plan. But this time, the government has so far remained steadfast in its position and criticism, arguing that the walkout has compromised the health and safety of the public.\n\nThe doctors reject that notion.\n\n“We’ve cried with patients and have held their hands along the way to their recovery,” Dr. Lee said. “We’re not criminals.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.5279706653795744,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1719,"startIndex":1277,"uri":"https://www.sanalhab.com/dunyadan/south-korea-moves-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-protesting-doctors/"},{"endIndex":2128,"startIndex":1783,"uri":"https://www.sanalhab.com/dunyadan/south-korea-moves-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-protesting-doctors/"},{"endIndex":2709,"startIndex":2059,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":3120,"startIndex":2595,"uri":"https://thedailydiarrhea.com/south-korea-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-striking-doctors/"},{"endIndex":3691,"startIndex":3149,"uri":"https://thedailydiarrhea.com/south-korea-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-striking-doctors/"},{"endIndex":4330,"startIndex":3749,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":4792,"startIndex":4363,"uri":"https://thedailydiarrhea.com/south-korea-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-striking-doctors/"},{"endIndex":5086,"startIndex":4841,"uri":"https://thedailydiarrhea.com/south-korea-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-striking-doctors/"},{"endIndex":5576,"startIndex":5117,"uri":"https://thedailydiarrhea.com/south-korea-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-striking-doctors/"},{"endIndex":6036,"startIndex":5611,"uri":"https://thedailydiarrhea.com/south-korea-to-suspend-licenses-of-thousands-of-striking-doctors/"},{"endIndex":6707,"startIndex":5941,"title":"Your prompt"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Seoul National University Bundang Hospital\n*   South Korea\n*   Severance Hospital\n*   Seoul\n*   United States"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-58.06288528442383}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.542882Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daaKRIcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4487},"candidatesTokenCount":38,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":38}],"promptTokenCount":1136,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1136}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1637,"totalTokenCount":2811,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.575423+00:00"}

Ramadan for most Muslim countries started on Monday.\n\nSharif appointed lawmaker Ishaq Dar as foreign minister and re-appointed Khawaja Mohammad Asif as defense minister.

The ceremony for presenting awards to the winners of the 5th season - 102 managers from 31 Russian regions and two foreign countries, Belgium and Serbia, - took place in Moscow on February 25.\n\n* * *\n\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon and welcome everyone.\n\nThis meeting with graduates of the Leaders of Russia format and platform is a regular event that is held with a simple goal in mind which is, first, to congratulate you on your achievements and, second, to hear what you have to say about the event and what you have learned during your contacts with each other and during conversations and classes that were held in various formats. This is the fifth class of graduates, and over a million people have been trained under this system over the years. Probably, this is the largest human resources forum internationally, not just in Russia, which is impressive.\n\nIt is crucial that the people with whom you met and talked and who formulated the tasks and assessed the results, have achieved much themselves and were in a position to assess your accomplishments objectively.\n\nThe third point that I would like to highlight is that this year you were able to work in the regions. I am aware there are people in this audience who work in the regions as part of their regular job, but nevertheless, it was important for everyone else to try their hand at addressing problems at the regional level. This is a critical element of training and competitive selection, as well as determining one's own abilities.\n\nI would like to thank our colleagues in the regions, the regional leaders, for providing this opportunity.\n\nI am also pleased to note that the number of applications, which was very large, includes more and more people who live permanently outside of Russia, but show interest in our country and want to work in Russia. They are eligible for expedited and simplified procedure for gaining Russian citizenship, and 29 people have already made that decision. These people were originally from 12 countries, such as the United States, France, Greece, and Bulgaria, as well as the CIS countries. A total of 29 people from 12 countries.\n\nIt is also important that we are involving our colleagues from the new territories, the new regions under the Leaders of Revival programme. I know that they are here as well. You will tell us how it all went.\n\nYou also know that we have opened a new page - this is the Time of Heroes [personnel programme]. They are in this audience as well - those who have taken part in serving the Motherland in the special military operation zone. We have been receiving applications since March and 30,000 applications have already been submitted.\n\nObviously, the selection must and will be strict enough. This will not be a one-time event but a regular process. So those who do not make it in the first attempt have every chance to send another application and get onto this platform. And for those who do not have a university degree, we will create the conditions for receiving it, if that's what they want, if they have such ambitions.\n\nObtaining a specific position is not an end in itself in these events. However, at least 470 people are already working in high positions and in the federal centre. I believe we have six deputy federal ministers, five deputy governors and governors in the regions, 10 people head municipalities (I see some of them here) while others work in the State Duma, the Federation Council, and our big companies with state participation - in general, in the most diverse areas and at a sufficiently high level.\n\nIt is very important that during this training, a certain community of people is taking shape. I am referring to those who undertake training and go through this competitive selection. What also matters, and I heard this from graduates in the previous years, is their ability to maintain these relations and exchange useful information that can be used at a specific job. I will repeat that this information comes from sources you trust and from the people that are very competent in their own areas.\n\nThis is probably all I wanted to say in the beginning. I would like to listen to you more, and I repeat, to hear your assessments and your proposals on improving this personnel selection system.\n\nI have already said this many times, but I would like to repeat it again. The main advantage of this work, the main advantage of this system of training and selection is that it does not work through pull or by using one's connections. What matters is one's own personal and professional skills.\n\nGo ahead please.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nSource: President of the Russian Federation website in English 1900 gmt 12 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.1380277934827303,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   Moscow\n*   Belgium\n*   Serbia\n*   United States\n*   France\n*   Greece\n*   Bulgaria\n*   CIS countries\n*   new territories (or new regions)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-121.86758422851563}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.540881Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dadGBIcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4217},"candidatesTokenCount":57,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":57}],"promptTokenCount":1040,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1040}],"thoughtsTokenCount":813,"totalTokenCount":1910,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.073774+00:00"}

Malik said it is not a new phenomenon that some people become \"agents of the enemy states or non-state actors\" for personal or group interests. He added \"fifth-generation warfare\" has many dimensions and those involved in it never get to know the real objectives. He further said those elements are \"brainwashed by their handlers\" who use issues which are \"sellable\", for example, religion can be used to motivate any person.\n\nCommenting on the recent attacks targeting Chinese nationals and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC, mega development project) projects, Malik said it should be seen who are the likely beneficiaries of these attacks. He noted if the Chinese are targeted, it would put a question mark on continuity of the projects they were working on and would also have an impact on the relations between the two countries. He questioned how foreign investors would come to Pakistan if such attacks continue.\n\nRaza asked Munawar Hasan, an expert on international affairs, whether people involved in militancy can be convinced through dialogue that they are following the wrong path. Hasan said, \"In the past, we tried holding dialogue, yet these elements have existed and have been attacking Pakistan's vital and strategic interests\". He emphasised Pakistan needs a \"two-pronged strategy\", which means diplomacy should continue with Afghanistan and \"kinetic force should be used to maintain deterrence\" within Pakistani borders. He noted the Pakistani armed forces are a conventional force, while \"terrorists engage in guerrilla warfare\". He expressed the view that \"fifth-generation warfare\" is being carried out by those who do not want connectivity in the region and are \"enemies of the CPEC\".\n\nDefence analyst Waqar Khan said when the Taliban government took over [in Afghanistan], there was confidence that there would be stability in Afghanistan as the Afghans would be in the government after the withdrawal of the Unites States (US), but unfortunately like all other Afghan governments in the last 40 years, the Taliban government also believes that it can \"draw some concessions by using terrorism as a tool of policy\". He noted the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government tried to give them some concessions but the Taliban had a \"greater design\". He mentioned in a recent video clip of a Taliban leader, he can be seen talking about \"international jihad\" and \"expansion of war\", which reflects \"greater designs\" of the Taliban. He claimed \"India has also jumped in\" after which attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan have increased. He was of the view that terrorism cannot be used as a \"policy tool\" for very long.\n\nMalik was of the view that militants have not been eliminated completely because the environment of the \"nurseries in which they are nurtured\" has not changed. He insisted unless an alternate source of livelihood, social uplift and sense of well-being is provided, these people would remain vulnerable to \"any kind of recruitment\". He recalled special economic zones and large-scale development was promised but has not been delivered, so the position of Afghanistan has remained unchanged.\n\nHasan said Pakistan will have to rely on its own resources in its fight against militancy and should seek cooperation from alternative centres of power at the regional level. He noted the Taliban's decision-making has been weak as they are still in the \"guerrilla warfare mode\". He claimed investments from China and Turkey have given the Taliban confidence and they have started thinking that they can pressurise Pakistan, but they cannot do so.\n\nHasan criticised the US policy on Afghanistan and said due to \"contradictory\" international policies, \"American influence has been eroding all around the world\" and an \"anti-US sentiment\" has been rising. He argued Pakistan had supported the US in its war against terror, so it should be supporting Pakistan at the time when it is facing threats from militants. He remarked if the US does not cooperate, Pakistan would \"obviously look for alternative options\".\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 28 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4817492961883545,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Pakistan\n*   Afghanistan\n*   US (United States)\n*   India\n*   China\n*   Turkey\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-47.415977478027344}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.315043Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"bN4daaOdE_DRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3570},"candidatesTokenCount":32,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":32}],"promptTokenCount":846,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":846}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1306,"totalTokenCount":2184,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:53.291839+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: By association, it was further suggested that broader forces wished Russia ill and would stop at nothing to that end.&#160;\n\nWas it Ukraine?\n\n&#8220;All the shooters in the barbaric terrorist attack in the Moscow region have been detained. They were heading for Ukraine,&#8221; as per the night&#8217;s main headline on Rossiya 1&#8217;s Vesti Nedeli (News of the Week), with Dmitry Kiselyov (which was again brought forward by an hour to start at 1900 Moscow time (1600 gmt) rather than its usual 2000).\n\nThe suggestion that Ukraine was involved was repeated and amplified across the board, on each of the three main channels. On Rossiya 1, its Vesti Nedeli began with Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s speech, in which he linked the attack with Ukraine. All four perpetrators have been found and detained, but &#8220;tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them from the Ukrainian side to cross the state border&#8221;, Putin said.\n\n&#8220;Just like the Nazis who once carried out massacres in the occupied territories, they planned to stage a show execution, a bloody act of intimidation,&#8221; he went on, but whoever directed them will be punished.\n\n&#8220;Both the US and Europe understand that any connection between Ukraine and the attack on Crocus City Hall would be suicide for both Kyiv and the entire anti-Russian alliance; in which case, Moscow will conduct possible negotiations on completely different terms,&#8221; one of Rossiya 1&#8217;s reports remarked.\n\nSeveral narratives were employed on Russian TV on the night to amplify the suggestion that Ukraine was involved, if not directly to blame it. The gamut ranged from the expression of doubt that the Islamic State group (IS/ISIS) was behind it in any of its iterations, to the propaganda refrain which frames Ukraine as a terrorist state.\n\nEscalation?&#160;\n\nThis, for instance, was Kiselyov: &#8220;They are already trying to throw everyone off the scent and, for example, they are talking about ISIS, while denials are coming from Kyiv, saying that it was not us. However, the irrefutable fact remains that the terrorists sought salvation in Ukraine and after their crime they headed in that direction, stopped just 100 kilometres from the border. Moreover, ISIS has a different style - terrorist attacks in the name of ISIS are carried out by suicide bombers who do not then try to escape.&#8221; &#8220;Islamic shaheds [martyrs or suicide bombers] usually commit suicide. These shooters, however, rushed to where they were presumably being expected - to Ukraine. Having failed to achieve success on the battlefield, Kyiv is increasingly turning into a terrorist country as it destroys civilians and shells cities day after day,&#8221; one of the reports on Rossiya 1 intoned.\n\nThese particular subthemes were elaborated elsewhere, including extensive editorial commentary by host Irada Zeynalova of NTV&#8217;s Itogi Nedeli (Results of the Week), to take just one of the many examples.\n\nHere, Zeynalova, too, raised doubts about IS&#8217;s involvement. She proceeded to claim that Russia was the target of presumably far broader forces whose aim it is &#8220;to hurt us&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;and to this end they are ready to do anything&#8221;. Furthermore, she appeared to suggest that this amounted to an escalation &#8211; or, she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s simply that they now want to raise the level of tension at any price&#8221;.\n\n&#8220;The absolutely clear understanding is that the Crocus attack could be a continuation of a chain of events in which sanctions have failed to cause us to collapse, the billions spent on weapons have been to no avail, and neither have been the propaganda campaign, the pledges of unwavering support for Kyiv or the plans for a counteroffensive, so terrorism is what is left in the arsenal,&#8221; Zeynalova posited.\n\nThis, she said, will not work either, but know, she said, that two can play this game.\n\nCoordination?\n\nIn large measure, this was echoed on Channel One&#8217;s Voskresnoye Vremya (Sunday Time). Here, inter alia and in concert with the other two networks, it gleaned what it more or less suggested was an international conspiracy, including by media in the West, to blame IS and thus divert suspicion away from Ukraine.\n\nAs it, like the other two, chided &#8220;the position taken by the media in the West, as it promotes the version of events which holds that Ukraine and terror are two different things&#8221;, it referred to the Foreign Ministry. &#8220;Any exoneration of Kyiv by Washington before the Crocus investigation is completed should be regarded as evidence&#8221; &#8211; that is to say, with suspicion, according to the ministry.\n\nUniquely, even US Fox News TV and its &#8220;eternal antagonist&#8221; CNN were in agreement about the role of Islamic State in the Crocus attack, in what Channel One suggested was a coordinated fashion. Other international media were name-checked in this context, including &#8220;information planted&#8221; by Reuters with a reference to the claim of responsibility on &#8220;Islamists&#8217; Telegram channel hitherto known to no-one&#8221;. It went on to raise similar doubts in other ways. &#8220;In the process, with incredible zeal, the US media sought to exonerate the Kyiv regime. Even though no-one had yet brought forward any accusations against the government of Ukraine, they began to make excuses in advance, one can say proactively, as if they knew something.&#8221; &#8220;All these efforts to divert attention turned out to be so coordinated that all they did was to attract it even more,&#8221; according to Channel One.\n\nIn various ways all three channels suggested there was equivalence between the Crocus attack and what they presented as Ukraine&#8217;s terror tactics &#8211; Russian propaganda&#8217;s term for cross-border attacks by Ukraine. All of them, the reports claimed, invariably target civilians, such as the shelling of Russia&#8217;s border Belgorod region. Furthermore, some of the discourse suggested a link between Ukraine and Islamic State &#8211; such as a claim contained in the Channel One report that &#8220;several dozen ISIS militants&#8221; had been deployed secretly by the US to fight on the side of the &#8220;regime&#8221;.\n\nPutin&#8217;s comments were televised accordingly. &#8220;In the past, the West actively took advantage of various kinds of cross-border radical terrorist groups, including as it encouraged their aggression against Russia. It is natural that the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime - again with the support of the West, and often on direct orders &#8211; has switched to terrorist methods. This means the shelling of peaceful cities, assassination attempts against government officials and public figures, or attempts to recruit perpetrators of sabotage and terrorist attacks at Russia&#8217;s critical infrastructure facilities and in places where people are in large numbers,&#8221; Putin told the FSB security service&#8217;s top brass.\n\nPutin v traitors\n\nAs usual, Putin&#8217;s comments served as the cue for much of the content on the night. A contrast was notably drawn between a nation united in grief and strong in the face of this attempt to intimidate it, on the one hand, and the &#8220;traitors&#8221; to the nation on the other.\n\nOn Rossiya 1, those against whom Putin railed as &#8220;traitors&#8221; were denounced in a dedicated piece of commentary from Kiselyov, who took his lead from what Putin had said earlier. Russia has no capital punishment, Putin said, but all those who have taken up arms to fight against their Mother Russia would be treated as enemy combatants. Each of them will be hunted down, Putin added, without statute of limitation. &#8220;We remember what the Vlasovites did on Soviet soil, and for this we will never forgive them.&#8221;\n\nHis reference to the Red Army&#8217;s defector Gen Andrei Vlasov provided the backdrop to commentary in which the word &#8220;traitors&#8221; and its apparent synonym &#8220;Vlasovites&#8221; was applied to others. They in particular included those Kiselyov branded &#8220;the new Vlasovites&#8221; &#8211; gathered together for an anti-Putin forum in Kyiv and headed by exiled anti-Kremlin figure Ilya Ponomaryov, the subject of particular opprobrium.\n\nA long list of the Chechen separatist leaders and field commanders assassinated or otherwise neutralised followed from Kiselyov, linked by him to Putin&#8217;s a \"historic\" threat against \"terrorists\" in 1999 (&#8220;we shall wipe them out in the outhouse\", although one of those on Kiselyov's list was Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, assassinated in 1996).\n\nImplicitly, the threat could thus be taken to extend to others, like Ponomarev, not to mention the Russian Legion or the Russian Volunteer Corps, both reportedly actively involved in fighting on Ukraine&#8217;s side. \"Russia and Putin do not forgive such things,\" Kiselyov said. &#8220;The Russian scumbag traitors thrown into meat assaults against their own motherland by the Bandera Nazi regime have two options: either perish now or a little later, but the end is predetermined in any case,&#8221; Kiselyov said.\n\nDissonant with this discourse, the same programme, Vesti Nedeli, asserted the putative involvement of &#8220;new Vlasovites&#8221; in the cross-border raids into Russia from Ukraine was no more than a &#8220;smokescreen&#8221;. &#8220;The Kyiv regime tried to present these attacks as an operation by traitors, as in that our positions were attacked by defectors, new Vlasovites. In fact, this was an operation by the Kyiv regime&#8217;s Main Intelligence Directorate [HUR], in which HUR&#8217;s Spetsnaz [special-forces] groups were involved along with foreign mercenaries. The Vlasovites were just a smokescreen, a billboard,&#8221; it said.\n\nOther: Ukraine, Europe, US\n\nAs before, reports continued to refer euphemistically to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine as a &#8220;special military operation&#8221;. As usual, they claimed a catastrophic situation on the front line and a critical situation behind the lines in Ukraine.\n\n&#8220;Front-line&#8221; dispatches claimed that Russian forces continued to advance towards Chasiv Yar, outside Bakhmut, as they have claimed for the past few weeks (though a distance of 10 miles between the two population centres). Each of the three channels aired reports that framed Russia&#8217;s latest series of massed attacks against Ukraine&#8217;s energy infrastructure in particular as &#8220;retribution&#8221; strikes for attacks against targets inside Russia.\n\nIn US-related reports, both Rossiya 1 and NTV sought to lend credence to allegations that Donald Trump&#8217;s life was in danger as the threat of they described as his &#8220;physical liquidation&#8221; loomed large.\n\nNTV alone sought to promote another conspiracy theory &#8211; a &#8220;new war&#8221; apparently in the making. &#8220;Statements that China will attack Taiwan in 2027 are precisely about this, and for the sake of this new war they will wear us down so that China does not have an ally,&#8221; Zeynalova claimed. Further discourse about the sinister US followed, including about the role of its miliary-industrial complex, where &#8220;big money&#8221; mingles accordingly with big politics.&#160;\n\nSimilarly, Rossiya 1 raised the spectre of US &#8220;hegemony&#8221; through military trade. &#8220;Increased defence spending will force nations to mercilessly cut social spending. This is something that none of the current European governments is likely to survive. The plan is totally outrageous, but they have no other choice. In fact, this is not even their plan, but that of the US. Washington is simply putting it into practice through the European elite it controls, which by its nature has the only aim - to ensure American hegemony in this part of the world,&#8221; Rossiya 1&#8217;s Europe correspondent Mikhail Antonov said, true to form.&#160;\n\nHis and other reports continued to claim a lack of unity on support for Ukraine both in Europe and the US.\n\nOver the studio caption \"Gallic fighting cock\", Kiselyov of Vesti Nedeli continued to attack French President Emanuel Macron &#8211; &#8220;bellicose&#8221; towards Russia but \"increasingly ridiculous\", unpopular and mocked even in France. Cue video/audio of a cockerel in a protracted cry of cock-a-doodle-do.\n\nOn all three channels, meanwhile, long reports marked the 25th anniversary of Nato&#8217;s bombing of Yugoslavia &#8211; decried by Kiselyov (despite Russia&#8217;s own track record of atrocities in Ukraine) as &#8220;a barbarity that lasted 78 days, with 1,700 civilians killed and more than 10,000 wounded&#8221;.&#160;\n\nSource: BBC Monitoring in English 0000 GMT 25 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1021451021717712,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Moscow region\n*   Moscow\n*   Crocus City Hall\n*   Kyiv\n*   US (United States)\n*   Europe\n*   West\n*   Washington\n*   Belgorod region\n*   Russia\n*   Soviet soil (referring to the former Soviet Union)\n*   Chechnya (implied from \"Chechen separatist leaders\")\n*   China\n*   Taiwan\n*   France\n*   Yugoslavia"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-124.54239654541016}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.689653Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dafWLKpe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":10852},"candidatesTokenCount":113,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":113}],"promptTokenCount":3250,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":3250}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1240,"totalTokenCount":4603,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:52.675591+00:00"}

When asked if he felt connected to the vision of Greater Israel, referring to Israel and the areas it conquered after the 1967 war including the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights, Netanyahu said \"very\".\n\nThe prime minister's remarks drew wide backlash from other Palestinian factions, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).\n\nNetanyahu's remarks draw wide Arab condemnation\n\nThe remarks also sparked wide condemnation from Arab countries including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in addition to the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.\n\nJordan described the remarks as a \"dangerous and provocative escalation\", warning they pose a direct threat to regional sovereignty. Meanwhile, the Saudi foreign ministry said it completely rejected the \"settlement and expansionist ideas and projects\" adopted by Israeli authorities. For its part, Egypt demanded \"clarifications\", noting that the remarks reflected \"rejection of the peace option in the region and insistence on escalation\", while Qatar described them as \"an extension of the occupation's approach based on arrogance\".\n\nThe Arab League said in a statement that Netanyahu's remarks were \"a violation of the sovereignty of Arab states and an attempt to undermine security and stability in the region\", while the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council said the remarks  were a \"flagrant violation of international law, as well as a blatant attack on the sovereignty of states and the unity of their lands\".\n\nTurkey reportedly pressures Hamas to disarm\n\nUnnamed Palestinian sources have told the Israeli daily Haaretz that Turkey has signalled to Hamas officials that they must comply with demands to disarm and relinquish power as efforts to reach a ceasefire deal continue.\n\nIn a report published yesterday, Haaretz noted that Qatar is expressing a similar position.\n\n\"Hamas feels the political isolation and this forces them to understand that they have no ability to entrench themselves in their demand to continue to possess weapons and government institutions,\" the source said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli army Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir approved yesterday the government's plan to occupy Gaza City despite his opposition to the operation, the public broadcaster Kan reported.

Bokhari said people did not come out in support of the PTI and there were hardly 25 people in the protest. She claimed no one was arrested and argued no government could allow blocking of roads and causing inconvenience to the public.\n\nPTI politician Nadeem Qureshi claimed on 8 February (polling day), the entire nation rejected the parties which have formed the government. He said the government took action because it was \"scared\" of the protesters. He alleged several people were arrested during the protest and questioned why the government deployed a large police force if people did not come out to join the PTI's protest.\n\nFarooq said many things have changed in Pakistani politics and a lot is still changing. He asked journalist Mujibur Rahman Shami whether Zardari's election and presidency with full support from the PML-N indicate that \"things have been stitched up so well that [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif's government will survive for a full five-year term\". Shami said at the moment it seems that the government will remain intact but nothing can be said with certainty about Pakistani politics in which \"any government can derail any time\". He added Sharif and Zardari are both \"champions of reconciliation\" and \"signs\" indicate that the arrangement would be sustainable.\n\nSenior journalist Muhammad Malick claimed it is true that the election was \"stolen\" and if that had not happened, a leader of another party would have been there in the prime minister's house. He said the PML-N government is dependent on support from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and noted the latter is in the \"most comfortable position\". He was of the view that the PPP decided to not join the cabinet because it knew the government would have to take very tough actions, particularly after an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He remarked the first year of the government would be \"very crucial\".\n\nOn Farooq's question whether Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) could get some relief in the coming months, Malick said no relief is likely to be given immediately as \"the [military] establishment has formed the government\" and Khan is out of power except for in one province [KP]. He added Khan is not in a position to \"publicly soften his stance\" because that would damage his support base.\n\nFarooq asked Shami to comment on the PTI's protest which was not joined by many people but several PTI members were still arrested in Punjab. Shami said political governments cannot afford a \"policy of arrests and victimisation\" and those who had adopted such a policy in the past eventually lost power. He insisted Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should not follow former caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi's policy because the latter was a caretaker and was not going to contest elections, but the former is a \"political representative of the people\".\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 10 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.6238507080078124,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Pakistan\n*   KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)\n*   Punjab\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-65.59626770019531}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.540176Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daZD8IMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2599},"candidatesTokenCount":25,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":25}],"promptTokenCount":655,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":655}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1139,"totalTokenCount":1819,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.813895+00:00"}

With its bid now ratified by all NATO members, neighboring Sweden is currently finalizing formalities to enter the military alliance as its 32nd member — most likely in March.\n\nBoth Sweden and Finland had developed strong ties with NATO after the end of the Cold War, but public opinion remained firmly against full membership until Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNonalignment was seen as the best way to avoid tensions with Russia, their powerful neighbor in the Baltic Sea region. But the Russian aggression caused a dramatic shift in public opinion in both countries, and they applied jointly for NATO membership in May 2022.\n\nFor years, the biannual NATO drill, which has been conducted in the Arctic extremes of northern Norway, was called “Cold Response.”\n\nHowever, “thanks to the NATO expansion with Finland and eventually Sweden, we are now expanding the exercise to a Nordic Response,” the Norwegian Armed Forces said on its website. This year, the drill is hosted equally by Finland, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe pan-Nordic drill is part of Steadfast Defender 24, NATO's biggest exercises in decades, with up to 90,000 troops involved over several months of drills that are aimed at showing that the alliance can defend all of its territory up to its border with Russia.\n\nThe participating nations in the current exercise that runs through March 15 are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States.\n\nRoughly half of the participating troops will drill on land. The rest will train at sea, with over 50 participating submarines, frigates, corvettes, aircraft carriers, and various amphibious vessels, and in the air with more than 100 fighter jets, transport aircraft, maritime surveillance aircraft and helicopters, according to the Norwegian military.\n\nThe combined joint training will focus on the defense and protection of the Nordic region, Norwegian military officials said.\n\n“We need to be able to fight back and stop anyone who tries to challenge our borders, values and democracy,” said Brigadier Tron Strand from the Royal Norwegian Air Force, Commander of the Norwegian Air Operations Center, in a statement. “With the current security situation in Europe, the exercise is extremely relevant and more important than ever before,” he added.\n\n“The High North represents an important and strategically located area for NATO” and the Nordic Response 2024 exercise “increases Nordic preparedness and the capability to conduct large-scale joint operations in challenging weather and climate,\" NATO said on its website.\n\nFinland’s new president, Alexander Stubb, will inspect the drill together with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in northern Norway on March 7. It’s the first foreign trip for Stubb since he was sworn in as Finland’s new head of state and its supreme military commander on March 1.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria of Sweden is to visit an airbase in northern Sweden on March 11, the country's military said.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.36638883443979114,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1322,"startIndex":1085,"uri":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/nato-launches-historic-nordic-response-drill-finland-norway-sweden"},{"endIndex":1924,"startIndex":1638,"uri":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/nato-launches-historic-nordic-response-drill-finland-norway-sweden"},{"endIndex":2503,"startIndex":2231,"uri":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/newly-enlarged-nato-starts-drill-in-finland-norway-sweden-in-defence-of-its-nordic-turf/article67912621.ece"},{"endIndex":2849,"startIndex":2584,"uri":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/nato-launches-historic-nordic-response-drill-finland-norway-sweden"},{"endIndex":3537,"startIndex":3294,"uri":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/nato-launches-historic-nordic-response-drill-finland-norway-sweden"},{"endIndex":3670,"startIndex":3417,"uri":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/newly-enlarged-nato-starts-drill-in-finland-norway-sweden-in-defence-of-its-nordic-turf/article67912621.ece"},{"endIndex":4278,"startIndex":3900,"uri":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/newly-enlarged-nato-starts-drill-in-finland-norway-sweden-in-defence-of-its-nordic-turf/article67912621.ece"},{"endIndex":4588,"startIndex":4322,"uri":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/newly-enlarged-nato-starts-drill-in-finland-norway-sweden-in-defence-of-its-nordic-turf/article67912621.ece"},{"endIndex":4966,"startIndex":4665,"uri":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/newly-enlarged-nato-starts-drill-in-finland-norway-sweden-in-defence-of-its-nordic-turf/article67912621.ece"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Finland\n*   Arctic\n*   Russia\n*   Sweden\n*   Ukraine\n*   Baltic Sea (region)\n*   Norway (including northern Norway)\n*   Nordic (region)\n*   Belgium\n*   Britain\n*   Canada\n*   Denmark\n*   France\n*   Germany\n*   Italy\n*   Netherlands\n*   Spain\n*   United States\n*   Europe\n*   High North"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-38.10443878173828}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:13:17.800289Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"jd4daaHsMMK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3013},"candidatesTokenCount":104,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":104}],"promptTokenCount":753,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":753}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1355,"totalTokenCount":2212,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:13:25.221431+00:00"}

Still, debris from the downed missiles fell in various parts of the city, causing the injuries and damage. No deaths have been reported so far.\n\n“Such terror continues every day and night,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a social media post that included a video of firefighters dousing burning buildings with water.\n\nThe attack began in the early morning with loud blasts jolting residents awake around 5 a.m. as air defense systems went into action. Many people rushed to take shelter in subway stations. Several orange fireballs lit up the sky, apparently the result of missile interceptions.\n\nAir-raid alerts ended at 6:10 a.m. just as sun rose, revealing the damage.\n\nVitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, said on Telegram that missile debris had caused fires in at least three residential buildings and in parking lots. He said emergency responders had been deployed to help victims. Four people were hospitalized, the city’s military administration said.\n\nPhotos of the aftermath of the attack released by Oleksiy Kuleba, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, and the local authorities showed burned-out cars in front of a building with a facade blackened by fire, a large hole at the foot of a pink building with all of its windows shattered, and a destroyed house on charred ground.\n\nIn the Podilskyi district, which is home to industrial facilities that Russia has targeted in the past, a plume of black smoke was rising early in the morning, suggesting a hit. Mr. Klitschko said a fire had broken out at a power substation in the area.\n\nIn the past, the targets of Russian air assaults have sometimes been unclear, and Ukrainian officials rarely confirm strikes on strategic industrial and military targets.\n\nOn Thursday, however, an official from Ukraine’s military intelligence services said most of the missiles had targeted the agency’s offices in the capital, but had been shot down before reaching their destination. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, and his claim could not be independently verified.\n\nThe assault Thursday came at a difficult time for Ukraine’s military, with Russian forces pressing ahead with ground attacks at several locations along the front line of more than 600 miles.\n\nFaced with a shortfall of troops and ammunition, Ukraine has struggled to contain Russian assaults in its east and south. Ukrainian officials have vowed to launch a counteroffensive this year, but experts say the military has yet to receive the kinds of weapons that would let it regain the initiative on the battlefield, with American aid held up in Congress.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, made an unannounced trip to Kyiv in an effort to show the White House’s continued commitment to Ukraine’s defense. He urged Republican lawmakers to pass the stalled package of billions of dollars in aid.\n\n“It has already taken too long,” Mr. Sullivan told reporters in a briefing at Ukraine’s presidential office. “And I know that — you know that.”\n\nThursday’s attack on Kyiv echoed a strategy used by Russia during air assaults in late December that consisted of overwhelming Ukraine’s air defenses with multiple launches of various types of missiles, including ballistic and hypersonic ones.\n\nRussia has launched relatively few large-scale missile attacks in recent months, despite a capacity to produce more than 115 long-range missiles per month, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nMr. Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukraine urgently needed more air defense systems from Western allies. He pointed to recent missile attacks on the cities of Kharkiv, Odesa and Kherson that claimed many lives.\n\n“We need the support of our partners,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We must prove that terror is always the loser.”\n\nOleksandra Mykolyshyn and Maria Varenikova contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.246975355881911,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":772,"startIndex":510,"uri":"https://www.moonofalabama.org/moonofa_posts/page/2/"},{"endIndex":1337,"startIndex":1115,"uri":"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2024/03/21/russia-kyiv-missile-attack-ukraine-zelenskyy-putin/stories/202403210102"},{"endIndex":1827,"startIndex":1550,"uri":"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2024/03/21/russia-kyiv-missile-attack-ukraine-zelenskyy-putin/stories/202403210102"},{"endIndex":2267,"startIndex":1930,"uri":"https://theprint.in/world/russia-launches-massive-missile-attack-in-kyiv-over-dozen-injured/2010865/"},{"endIndex":2578,"startIndex":2320,"uri":"https://www.moonofalabama.org/moonofa_posts/page/2/"},{"endIndex":3348,"startIndex":2994,"uri":"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2024/03/21/russia-kyiv-missile-attack-ukraine-zelenskyy-putin/stories/202403210102"},{"endIndex":4077,"startIndex":3715,"uri":"https://theprint.in/world/unacceptable-must-end-immediately-un-secretary-general-guterres-on-russian-missile-strikes-on-ukraine/2012822/"},{"endIndex":4827,"startIndex":4570,"uri":"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2024/03/21/russia-kyiv-missile-attack-ukraine-zelenskyy-putin/stories/202403210102"},{"endIndex":5690,"startIndex":5447,"uri":"https://www.moonofalabama.org/moonofa_posts/page/2/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Kyiv\n*   Ukraine\n*   Podilskyi district (within Kyiv)\n*   Russia\n*   east (of Ukraine)\n*   south (of Ukraine)\n*   Kharkiv\n*   Odesa\n*   Kherson"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-81.05339813232422}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.167103Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4dab-ZCsTU1PIPtY6l6QQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3393},"candidatesTokenCount":65,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":65}],"promptTokenCount":822,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":822}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1670,"totalTokenCount":2557,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.423447+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Mr. Varadkar’s decision, which he attributed to both “personal and political” reasons, was unexpected, with some members of his government given only a few hours’ notice of his plans.\n\nA medical doctor and former health minister, Mr. Varadkar first became taoiseach, or prime minister, in 2017, at a time when his Fine Gael party was still one of the country’s two dominant parties, a position it had enjoyed nearly uninterrupted since the founding of the Irish state.\n\nDuring his years in office, though, public opinion shifted, and as Fine Gael’s popularity dipped, his departure seemed inevitable, experts said. Now, as Ireland grapples with what comes next for its government, here’s what to know.\n\nWho might be Ireland’s next leader?\n\nDespite calls from the opposition for a general election, Mr. Varadkar’s resignation does not mean an end to the current government.\n\nFine Gael, a center-right party, currently governs in coalition with two other parties, Fianna Fáil, its longtime rival, and the Green Party. Under the terms of their power-sharing arrangement, it is up to Fine Gael to appoint a new leader, who will then become the prime minister.\n\nBecause of the surprise nature of Mr. Varadkar’s announcement, there was no immediate successor waiting in the wings, leading to an initial rush of speculation about who might fill his position.\n\nBy Thursday evening, though, it appeared that Simon Harris, the minister for education, might be vying for the role uncontested. For years he has spoken of his desire to one day lead the party, and on Thursday evening he confirmed to the national broadcaster RTÉ, “I want to be the next leader of Fine Gael,” adding, “If given the opportunity, I will give this my all.”\n\nMr. Harris, who is 37, will become the youngest-ever taoiseach if he does become the party’s leader, edging out Mr. Varadkar, who initially took up the leadership role at 38. So far, it appears that other members of the party are rallying around him.\n\nOther potential contenders included party stalwarts like Paschal Donohoe, the minister for public expenditure and reform, and Heather Humphreys, the minister for social protection. Both are longtime Fine Gael lawmakers, but in the past 24 hours both have said they have no intention of putting themselves forward.\n\nHow long until the new leader is announced?\n\nIn his resignation speech, Mr. Varadkar laid out an aspirational timeline for Fine Gael to appoint a new leader, saying that he wanted a successor to be elected before the party’s annual conference on April 6. That person would then become prime minister when parliament resumed on April 9, after an Easter break.\n\nThe process to get there, though, could become complicated if more than one lawmaker contests the election.\n\nOne reason for the urgency to choose a new leader is that Ireland will hold local and European elections in June.\n\nIn addition, Ireland’s Dáil, the popularly elected lower house of parliament, has a maximum term of five years, so a national election must be held before March 22, 2025. That means that whoever replaces Mr. Varadkar will serve as taoiseach for less than a year before an election is called.\n\nWhat does this mean for Irish politics?\n\nMr. Varadkar, the young, gay son of an Irish mother and an Indian father, once seemed like an emblem of a new, more energetic and inclusive Ireland. Now, he is the face of an increasingly unpopular establishment.\n\nHis resignation follows years of waning support for the long-dominant parties, Fine Gael, which dropped to the third most popular in the country’s last general election in 2020, and Fianna Fáil. It crystallizes the perception that Irish politics is in a moment of flux and uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin, once the political branch of the I.R.A., rose from its position as a fringe player to win the most votes in the last election. No party came close to a majority, forcing the formation of a coalition.\n\nAll of the major parties are fighting political headwinds, as Ireland faces a number of domestic challenges. A severe housing shortage — caused partly by the failure of successive governments to invest in affordable housing — and a cost-of-living crisis have created widespread frustration with the political establishment.\n\nWith the number of asylum seekers arriving in the country rising sharply, the government has had to contend with an anti-immigration backlash driven in part by far-right rhetoric online.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: At a hearing on Wednesday before a special committee of the State Senate, which recently began investigating Ms. Willis, the defense lawyer leading the disqualification effort testified that Ms. Willis had once taken a large sum of money from her political campaign for her personal use.\n\nThe senator presiding over the hearing, Bill Cowsert, a Republican, was taken aback by the allegation. “I think all of us up here that have campaigns know that you can’t take campaign funds for personal use, right?” he asked.\n\nThe defense lawyer, Ashleigh Merchant, told Mr. Cowsert that she was “not well versed in that area of law, but that is my understanding.” He replied, “It’s pretty black and white.”\n\nThere is no evidence to back up the allegation. In fact, Ms. Willis lent her first campaign nearly $50,000, drawn from a retirement account, and was paid back only a fraction of that, according to her office, campaign finance records and her past remarks.\n\nBut the incident reflected that even if Ms. Willis survives the effort to disqualify her, she would face tough inquiries by Georgia Republicans that could perpetuate questions about her character and uncertainty around the Trump case for months to come.\n\nSeven months have passed since Ms. Willis brought the racketeering case against Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies, charging them with conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Four of the defendants have already pleaded guilty, and Ms. Willis at one point told the judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, that she was aiming for a trial to start in August.\n\nBut the case was upended in January after Ms. Merchant revealed in a court filing that Ms. Willis had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the lawyer she hired in November 2021 to manage the Trump case.\n\nMs. Merchant represents Michael Roman, a defendant and former Trump campaign official. She and other defense lawyers have said that Ms. Willis engaged in “self-dealing,” because she took a number of vacations with Mr. Wade after hiring him while using public funds to pay him more than $650,000 to date.\n\nThe filing forced Ms. Willis to publicly acknowledge that she and Mr. Wade had pursued a romance. And the allegations were concerning enough that Judge McAfee held a series of public hearings over the last few weeks to determine whether the relationship had created a disqualifying conflict of interest. The judge has said that he will decide by next week.\n\nLegal experts have pointed out that Ms. Willis could have avoided this particular controversy had she not had a romantic relationship with someone who worked for her.\n\nMs. Merchant testified on Wednesday that if Ms. Willis had gone to the county and said, “I’m having an affair with this man, but he is brilliant and he would be an amazing prosecutor on this election interference case,” then “we wouldn’t be here,” because the hiring, Ms. Merchant later added, “wouldn’t have been approved.”\n\nThe Senate investigation is one of several springing up around Ms. Willis. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a Trump ally and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has used the conflict-of-interest allegations to seek more records as part of the committee’s ongoing investigation of the district attorney’s office. Georgia Republicans are in the process of empowering a prosecutorial oversight commission that is also expected to review the matter.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate created its special committee to investigate Ms. Willis soon after the motion was filed to disqualify her. The committee has no power to punish the district attorney. But with the power to issue subpoenas, it can embarrass her.\n\nThat could help Mr. Trump as he seeks to win Georgia in the presidential election. Negative headlines about Ms. Willis generated by the committee’s work could also influence potential jurors if the Trump case ends up going to trial.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing on Wednesday, Ms. Merchant said that Ms. Willis recently testified that she had used a large amount of money from her failed 2018 campaign for a local judgeship to reimburse Mr. Wade for expenses from their vacations.\n\nMs. Merchant said that Ms. Willis testified “that the majority of the cash she had on hand was from her campaign,” and that it was “a loan she had given herself from the campaign.”\n\n“She was very clear about that,” Ms. Merchant added.\n\nIn fact, Ms. Willis’s testimony on Feb. 15 was not clear. She said: “When I ran for judge I took $50,000 of my personal money out of my retirement and that money ended up being lost.”\n\nLater in her testimony, when she was pressed further about how she had repaid Mr. Wade, she said that she had taken “a large amount of money on my first campaign,” and that she had “kept some of the cash of that.” Neither the judge nor defense lawyers asked at the time what exactly she meant.\n\nCampaign finance records from Ms. Willis’s judicial campaign show loans of $49,000, and that the campaign reimbursed her roughly $8,500 in 2018.\n\nAfter the Senate hearing, a spokesman for Ms. Willis’s office said Ms. Merchant had “misstated the D.A.’s testimony.” The spokesman, Jeff DiSantis, said Ms. Willis “testified that she took money out of her retirement to fund her unsuccessful 2018 campaign for Superior Court judge.”\n\n“She did not testify that she took money out of her campaign for herself, other than the repayment of the loan that is detailed in her campaign report,” he added.\n\nMs. Merchant, in an email, said that her testimony “was based on Ms. Willis’s statements under oath.”\n\nThe Senate committee is planning to meet again in the next few weeks.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-6.317857055664063,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Georgia\n*   Fulton County Superior Court\n*   Ohio"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-157.94642639160156}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.540889Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dadmBIcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4717},"candidatesTokenCount":25,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":25}],"promptTokenCount":1234,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1234}],"thoughtsTokenCount":790,"totalTokenCount":2049,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.921877+00:00"}

The warning comes as IAEA inspectors arrived in Iran to oversee refuelling at the Bushehr plant, an activity conducted under a separate Iran-Russia agreement.\n\nCiting its diplomatic sources, Reuters reported that the snapback process is likely to be initiated today.\n\nGharibabadi said that if the snapback is activated, \"Iran will take a special measure and issue a warning and notification to the UN Security Council. Moreover, such a step would seriously impact our cooperation with the IAEA, which could potentially be suspended.\"\n\nSeparately, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a hardline lawmaker and member of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said in a TV interview that Iran \"will use all the tools\" at its disposal if the snapback is activated and that if Iran is not prevented from exporting its oil, \"something will definitely happen that other oil is not exported either\".\n\nFM meets MPs to talk IAEA cooperation, 'snapback'\n\nSeparately, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee to discuss nuclear talks with the E3 and the snapback mechanism.\n\nHe later told reporters that no new cooperation text with the IAEA has been finalised and that the recent entry of IAEA inspectors was solely for the Bushehr plant refuelling, authorised by Iran's Supreme National Security Council.\n\nJAAM-E JAM\n\nPapers discuss IAEA presence in Iran\n\nIranian dailies today discussed the presence of IAEA inspectors in Iran and apparent dissent by hardline MPs over the matter.\n\nHardline Javan daily warned the inspectors' return \"without any guarantees\" against further attacks strengthens the view that the IAEA is using Bushehr as a \"foot in the door\" for a wider return.\n\nUltraconservative Keyhan daily condemned the inspectors' return as a \"suspicious presence\" and a \"costly error\". It said that the IAEA has become an \"intelligence arm of the West\" and that any official circumventing parliament's law to allow access would be \"responsible to the Iranian people\".\n\nConservative Farhikhtegan newspaper noted that while the SNSC's approval made it legal, MPs retain the right to demand reports on whether the conditions for cooperation have been met.

Navalny, was also invited but is unable to attend.\n\nAnd it is unclear how many lawmakers will be waving Ukrainian flags this year, as the initial outrage that welled after Mr. Putin’s invasion has given way to the partisan squabbling and gridlock that now characterize politics in the United States.\n\nMr. Biden’s latest aid package proposal — $60.1 billion for badly needed artillery ammunition, air defense interceptors and other weapons — remains stalled in Congress, already undermining the fight on the ground in Ukraine, where American officials say more than 500,000 have been killed and injured between the two sides.\n\nMr. Putin’s military was forced to abandon its drive to Kyiv, the capital, on April 2, 2022, thanks to stiff Ukrainian resistance helped by real-time intelligence provided by the United States and NATO allies, not to mention poor logistics and tactical decision-making on the Russian part. But Russia decimated many cities and towns in the east and established a “land bridge” connecting the mainland with Crimea, the peninsula that Mr. Putin illegally seized in 2014. And two years on, depleted Ukrainian forces are still trying to hold off advancing Russian troops in the east.\n\nMr. Biden will certainly exhort Congress to move forward on the aid package in his speech, administration officials said. But some contingency planning is also underway.\n\nThe administration is trying to cobble together a stopgap package of artillery ammunition and air defense interceptors, paid for with money from Army contracts that came in under bid, U.S. officials said. That measure, which could also include some longer-range guided missiles known as ATACMs, was unlikely to be ready in time to announce during Mr. Biden’s remarks on Thursday, they added.\n\nBut at best, the makeshift solution would only keep advancing Russian troops at bay for a few weeks.\n\nMr. Biden will be able to point to at least one success that has resulted from Mr. Putin’s invasion: One person who accepted the White House invitation is the Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden, which became NATO’s newest member just a few hours before Mr. Biden’s speech was scheduled to begin.\n\nSweden along with Finland decided to apply to join NATO shortly after the invasion began, expanding the alliance that has so bedeviled Mr. Putin.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1802884056454612,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":867,"startIndex":579,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"},{"endIndex":1279,"startIndex":1035,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"},{"endIndex":1749,"startIndex":1410,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"},{"endIndex":2159,"startIndex":1875,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"},{"endIndex":2812,"startIndex":2527,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"},{"endIndex":3764,"startIndex":3379,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"},{"endIndex":4306,"startIndex":4006,"uri":"https://archive.ph/2024.03.08-024307/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   United States\n*   Kyiv\n*   NATO (as an alliance of countries)\n*   Crimea\n*   Sweden\n*   Finland\n*   the east (referring to eastern Ukraine)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-74.35816955566406}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.882153Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daenrNZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2186},"candidatesTokenCount":63,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":63}],"promptTokenCount":559,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":559}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1203,"totalTokenCount":1825,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.443484+00:00"}

He added that the U.S. military presence ''violates all the constitutional and democratic rules, which would require the sovereign people -- notably through its elected officials -- to be consulted on the installation of a foreign army on its territory.''\n\nMatthew Miller, the chief State Department spokesman, said it was in touch with the ruling military junta, known as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland, or CNSP, about the move.\n\n''We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP's trajectory,'' he said in a message on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMany of the Americans posted to Niger are stationed at U.S. Air Base 201, a six-year-old, $110 million installation in the country's desert north. But since the military coup that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum and installed the junta last July, the troops there have been inactive, with most of their drones grounded.\n\nBecause of the coup, the United States had to suspend security operations and development aid to Niger.\n\nMr. Bazoum, the country's elected president, is still under arrest, eight months after he was ousted. But the United States had wanted to maintain its partnership with the country.\n\nA senior U.S. military official said on Sunday there had been no immediate changes to the status of about 1,000 American military personnel stationed in the country. The Pentagon has continued to conduct surveillance drone flights from Air Base 201 to protect U.S. troops and alert the Nigerien authorities if the flights detected an imminent terrorist threat.\n\n''The canceling of the security agreement is not quite a direct expulsion of the American military presence, as happened with the French,'' said Hannah Rae Armstrong, an analyst focused on peace and security in the Sahel. ''It's more likely an aggressive negotiation tactic to extract more benefits from cooperating with the Americans.''\n\nIn Niger, the decision was couched in terms of ''sovereignty'' -- rhetoric meant to resonate with the public.\n\n''The goal of American policy is not to help fight armed groups, but to maintain control and counter the growing influence in the region of countries such as Russia, China and Turkey,'' Abdoulaye Sissoko, a Nigerien columnist, wrote on a popular Nigerien news site. ''There is no public evidence that American bases in Niger have proven useful.''\n\nAmerican officials say they have tried for months to prevent a formal break in relations with Niger's junta.\n\nThe new U.S. ambassador to Niger, Kathleen FitzGibbon, one of Washington's top Africa specialists, has held regular discussions with the junta since taking office at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn a trip to Niger in December, Molly Phee, an assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, said the United States intended to resume security and development cooperation with Niger, even as she called for a swift transition to civilian rule and the release of Mr. Bazoum.\n\nBut the Pentagon has been planning for the worst-case contingencies if the talks failed. The Defense Department has been discussing establishing new drone bases with several coastal West African countries as backups to the base in Niger, which is landlocked. Talks are still in the early stages, military officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.\n\nJ. Peter Pham, a former special U.S. envoy to the Sahel, said Washington will ''have to wait and see'' how Niger will implement the new approach.\n\n''The potential fallout goes beyond the not insignificant damage to counterterrorism and intelligence efforts that loss of access to the bases in Niger entail,'' Mr. Pham said, ''but to the broader damage to America's standing on the continent.''\n\nThe Biden administration formally acknowledged last October what most countries had declared months previously: that the military takeover in Niger last July was a coup.\n\nBiden administration officials had sidestepped that declaration for weeks because the word ''coup'' has major policy implications. Congress has mandated that the United States must halt all economic and military aid to any government installed by a military coup until democracy is restored.\n\nBut the administration finally concluded that efforts to restore Niger's democratically elected government to power had failed and that aid that had not already been restricted would be cut off. State Department officials said nearly $200 million in aid that was temporarily paused in August would be suspended. About $442 million in trade and agricultural assistance will also be suspended.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration had been holding out increasingly dim hopes that the military junta would reverse its takeover and agree to restore a democratically elected government.\n\nThe junta's announcement is part of a major change in dynamic between the country and its erstwhile Western partners.\n\n''It reflects a real shift in the balance of power,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ''Over the past decade, Niger has repeatedly pleaded for security assistance and aid. Now it's the U.S. that finds itself in a position of being asked to beg to keep forces and bases in the country.''\n\nThe entire military approach in the Sahel needs to be reformed, said El Hadj Djitteye, director of the Timbuktu Center for Strategic Studies on the Sahel, a Mali-based think tank.\n\n''Western governments including the United States and France have failed to work closely with African governments and civilian populations in economic and military development,'' Mr. Djitteye said. This, he said, has fed the widely held perception that their presence in the region is an extension of ''the old colonial pattern which puts colonial interests first and African interests a distant second.''\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6239032526125853,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   **Countries:**\n    *   Niger\n    *   United States (U.S.)\n    *   Russia\n    *   Iran\n    *   France\n    *   China\n    *   Turkey\n    *   Mali\n\n*   **Regions/Continents:**\n    *   West Africa\n    *   Africa\n    *   Sahel\n    *   Sahara\n\n*   **Cities:**\n    *   Washington (referring to the U.S. government/capital)\n    *   Niamey (capital of Niger)\n    *   Timbuktu (mentioned in the name of a think tank, located in Mali)\n\n*   **Specific Installations:**\n    *   U.S. Air Base 201 (in Niger)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-108.55916595458984}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.806302Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daZ6bMZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5904},"candidatesTokenCount":174,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":174}],"promptTokenCount":1407,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1407}],"thoughtsTokenCount":928,"totalTokenCount":2509,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.565622+00:00"}

At an hour and 55 minutes, the programme was shorter than usual, to make way for a version of election coverage in the form of an unscheduled Vesti bulletin for the next two hours.\n\nChannel One&#8217;s &#8220;special&#8221; Vremya (Time) edition started at its usual time of 2100 but it extended its bulletin late into the night to include the latest speeches by Vladimir Putin, which took the programme into four-hour territory. Its veteran host Yekaterina Andreyeva was at the helm, not always smoothly, throughout the programme.\n\nEarly, pre-exit poll coverage\n\nNTV&#8217;s Itogi Nedeli and Rossiya 1&#8217;s Vesti Nedeli were aired well before exit poll data was officially announced at 2100, which gave Putin a landslide share of 87% of the vote. Accordingly, their reports were confined to heavy hints from voters about the kind of candidate they would like to lead Russia in the next six years. &#8220;We need someone who will lead our country for the next six years. Someone who is decisive, who is courageous and who will bring us to victory,&#8221; a man captioned as ex-navy told NTV.&#160;\n\nThe discourse claimed a high turnout and emphasised the importance of the vote as a manifestation of unity and consolidation in the face of external pressure and hostility. This was Dmitry Kiselyov of Vesti Nedeli, for example: &#8220;We need to understand the nature of such high civic activity. This, now, is a special election. In effect, it is a wartime one, as both missile salvoes and drone swarms head in our direction every day in the hope that they can disrupt the electoral process through intimidation. However, exactly the opposite has happened. People rallied and even those who had not done so before went to vote. Such a high turnout is the answer to all attempts to interfere with the election.&#8221;\n\nThe vox pop in the reports was monotone, not to say apparently scripted, as voters, to camera, expressed their sentiment in near-identical terms. Some recalled the hardship of the 1990s and by contrast invoked what they described as the many changes for the better in their lives now. Others professed their pride in Russia, apparently the envy of the world. Separately, voters in Russia&#8217;s &#8220;new regions&#8221; (such as Donbas and other occupied Ukraine) were given the floor to say they were happy to be back with Russia again.\n\nSeparate reports were fashioned to describe the vote in Russia&#8217;s border Belgorod Region, where voters were unafraid to be active even though it has been under continuous attack from Ukraine, as the story ran.\n\n&#8220;The fact is that Russia has a very transparent and democratic electoral system, as international public observers note,&#8221; according to Rossiya 1&#8217;s summary of the state of affairs.&#160;\n\nUkraine&#8217;s &#8216;terrorist tactics&#8217;\n\nIn the context of Belgorod and more generally, Ukraine was described as either a terrorist or Nazi &#8220;regime&#8221;, or both. On Rossiya 1&#8217;s Vesti Nedeli, Kiselyov used the slur &#8220;Bandera Nazi regime&#8221; repeatedly and pointedly throughout his programme. A start on this usage was made as Kiselyov looked back to his interview with Putin at the start of last week, to which he returned again and again during his programme. &#8220;It is important to realise the historical inevitability of the battle with the Bandera Nazi regime, which, with the support of the West, has encroached not only on its own Russians [in Ukraine], but also on Russia itself. And the Russians are today the largest divided nation in the world,&#8221; Kiselyov said. &#8220;If we abandon these people today, then tomorrow our losses may increase many times over, and our children will not have a future, because we will feel insecure. We will be a third or fourth class nation. No one will take us into account if we cannot protect ourselves. And the consequences could be catastrophic for Russian statehood,&#8221; Putin told Kiselyov. &#8220;The West also understands that for Russia this is a matter of life and death. They dream about the death of Russia. Hence all these insane quantities of weapons and money provided to the Bandera Nazi regime. They have even begun to discuss sending troops. Maybe we should also take an unconventional step and ask to send North Korean troops to help us? After all, the friendly DPRK has an army of more than two million, and we once helped North Korea a lot in the battle with America. Putin&#8217;s response was that on the one hand, he did not obviously rule out such a turn, but at the same time, there is no need to turn to North Korea now. We can handle it ourselves,&#8221; Kiselyov said. &#8220;But a categorical no was the response to the question whether it ever occurred to us, during difficult moments for the front last year, to use tactical nuclear weapons,&#8221; Kiselyov added.\n\nAs elsewhere, Channel One described what it framed as &#8220;attempted breakthroughs&#8221;, that is to say incursions into Russia from Ukraine by hostile forces, as an attempt to destabilise Russia during the presidential election. &#8220;Carried out by elite Ukrainian special forces along with foreign mercenaries, with armour and artillery support&#8221;, they were repelled. &#8220;As a result, hundreds of militants are dead, dozens of pieces of equipment destroyed, but the Russian border is still securely locked,&#8221; according to Channel One&#8217;s Yekaterina Andreyeva&#8217;s summary. &#8220;After this rout, the adversary switched to its usual terrorist tactics as it launched strikes against peaceful neighbourhoods, including with drones stuffed full of explosives,&#8221; it added.\n\nChannel One went on to liken Ukraine to Nazi Germany, branding Kyiv &#8220;a Nazi regime&#8221; and &#8220;direct successor to Hitler's&#8221;, complete with a campaign of &#8220;mass terror&#8221;.\n\nOver on NTV, the Belgorod raid was framed as an attempt at distraction amid bad news from the battlefield. &#8220;Militants have been trying to get into the Kursk region and Belgorod region like cockroaches since Tuesday. Ever since then, action has been taken to crush them like bedbugs,&#8221; the report remarked.\n\nEscalation, nuclear again\n\nAs NTV&#8217;s Zeynalova continued to ponder the issue of escalation, she invoked US diplomat George F. Kennan&#8217;s 1997 op-ed as an argument against Nato&#8217;s expansion (&#8220;A Fateful Error&#8221;). This, she said, is &#8220;hybrid war, in which any methods are being used&#8221;, complete with &#8220;fakes&#8221; and &#8220;discussions about nuclear use&#8221; and &#8220;statements about an imminent retaliatory offensive&#8221;; all &#8220;a game of escalation according to Kennan&#8217;s logic of an escalation ladder&#8221;. She went on to quote an unspecified essay in Responsible Statecraft, with the apparent suggestion that it was time for the West to push Ukraine towards negotiations. What with US President Joe Biden&#8217;s new Iran sanctions waiver and Nato Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoana&#8216;s reported remarks about the years of tense relations with Russia to come, Zeynalova said, there is a chance for de-escalation.&#160;\n\n&#8220;Compared to statements about our strategic defeat, this may already mean something simple - there is a chance over the years to move away from the dangerous threshold with talk of nuclear use. If we use it, we will have a chance to find reasons to build new relationships. But, as Putin says, it takes two to tango,&#8221; Zeynalova said.\n\nHere, on NTV, as on the other two channels, Putin&#8217;s assurances, in his interview with Kiselyov, that Russia is willing to negotiate about Ukraine provided Russia is given security guarantees were televised.&#160;\n\nPutin&#8217;s latest nuclear rhetoric, also in his interview with Kiselyov, also made an appearance, in which he said Russia was ready for nuclear war &#8220;from a military-technical point of view&#8221;. But other than a long extract from Putin himself televised on Vesti Nedeli, it was not especially dwelt on in any of the commentary. If anything, it seemed to be purposely played down. The phrase &#8220;from a military-technical point of view&#8221; was present in Kiselyov&#8217;s account of this point from his interview with Putin, but the words &#8220;[ready] for nuclear war&#8221; contained in the question&#8217;s wording were absent, replaced as they were with Kiselyov&#8217;s comment that this appertained to the status of Russia&#8217;s strategic missile forces. Over on NTV, meanwhile, these words were omitted altogether, its relevant commentary confined to what Putin said about the newness of Russia&#8217;s nuclear triad, even though elsewhere in its commentary, rebuttal appeared mixed with satisfaction at the effect of Putin&#8217;s latest nuclear outburst.\n\n&#8220;American propaganda assigns the role of the first strike to Vladimir Putin. Therefore, everything he said in the interview about the possibility of using nuclear weapons became a real bomb shell, even though the Americans themselves were not uninvolved in whipping up this hysteria. CNN reported last week that Russia was planning a nuclear strike on Ukraine at the end of 2022 and that the United States itself was carefully preparing for the consequences. A little earlier, meanwhile, the United States convinced the whole world that Russia was about to use nuclear weapons in space,&#8221; NTV&#8217;s story ran.\n\nMore Macron, &#8216;mercenaries&#8217;\n\nAs over the previous couple of weeks, Russian TV&#8217;s news reviews continued to be preoccupied with French President Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s series of pronouncements on Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine. There was extensive anti-Macron content especially on Rossiya 1 and NTV, plus a segment on Channel One.\n\nRossiya 1 was especially strident in its anti-Macron commentary. In his dispatch, inter alia, its Europe correspondent Mikhail Antonov described France&#8217;s ministerial duo of PM Gabriel Attal and Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne as &#8220;the homosexual pair, Attal and Sejourne, completely controlled&#8221; by Macron (the word &#8220;homosexual&#8221; present in the broadcast version but mysteriously absent from media monitoring service Medialogia&#8217;s text transcript).\n\nApparent contrast was served up with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#8217;s caution, with his refusal to supply Ukraine with the Taurus long-range cruise missile. Nevertheless, the channels felt it necessary to amplify warnings against such an eventuality. Further claims of a Nato split on support for Ukraine provided an accompaniment.\n\nIn the same report, incongruously (given Russia&#8217;s actions), Antonov asserted that any Taurus supplies to Ukraine would amount to an act of &#8220;aggression against a foreign state&#8221;, any such German involvement also &#8220;prohibited&#8221; by its constitution.\n\nOn Channel One, it invoked a 2022 &#8220;Ukrainian propaganda&#8221; production, its gist &#8220;to frighten the Germans with computer simulation of an ostensible missile attack on the centre of Berlin&#8221; (cue part of the montage where a member of the public in front of the Brandenburg Gate ducks in fear as an object like a missile streaks low over her). The question the report went on to pose was: &#8220;What if Kyiv strikes Russian targets but the Germans get hit [in retaliation]?&#8221;\n\nOver on NTV, meanwhile, it discerned Macron&#8217;s attempt to walk back on some of his statements as he met Scholz and Polish PM Donald Tusk. &#8220;Perhaps to backtrack, on Friday in Germany, at a meeting with Scholz and Tusk, who had returned from Washington, Macron said that the [three] were not parties to the conflict and would never initiate escalation. Although Macron tried to present the alliance of the three countries as a single fist to fight Russia, there has been no talk of unity for a long time,&#8221; it said.\n\nAll this was combined with discourse about what was framed in unison as the use of &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; by Ukraine, on the back of the Russian Defence Ministry&#8217;s claims. The reports&#8217; usage was &#8220;soldiers of misfortune&#8221;, to convey the message of the inevitable fate that awaits them &#8211; death at the hands of the Russian military.\n\nSource: BBC Monitoring in English 1600 GMT 17 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.0812507398200757,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   West\n*   US (United States/America)\n*   EU (European Union)\n*   Ukraine\n*   Moscow\n*   Donbas\n*   Belgorod Region\n*   North Korea (DPRK)\n*   France\n*   Europe\n*   Germany\n*   Berlin\n*   Brandenburg Gate\n*   Kyiv\n*   Poland\n*   Washington"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-107.0438232421875}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.529679Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daY-qIMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":11804},"candidatesTokenCount":99,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":99}],"promptTokenCount":3572,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":3572}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1048,"totalTokenCount":4719,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.484032+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The new information comes from Cindi Lee Yeager, a deputy district attorney in neighboring Cobb County, Ga., whom the defense lawyers said they spoke to on Friday about conversations she has had with Mr. Bradley.\n\nAt issue is a key matter in the disqualification effort: the timing of the romantic relationship that developed between Fani T. Willis, who as the Fulton County district attorney is leading the prosecution of Mr. Trump, and Nathan Wade, the Atlanta-area lawyer she hired to manage the case.\n\nMs. Willis and Mr. Wade have said that a romance developed between them after she hired him in November 2021. But the defense lawyers have tried to prove the romantic relationship started earlier.\n\nIf they are correct that Ms. Willis hired a boyfriend for a lucrative, high-profile job, it might bolster their argument that she engaged in “self-dealing” when she took a number of vacations with Mr. Wade, and thus created a conflict of interest that should result in her removal from the case.\n\nDefense lawyers thought that Mr. Bradley, a former law partner of Mr. Wade who also served for a time as Mr. Wade’s divorce lawyer, might offer some clarity as to when the romance began. But that did not happen. In a text exchange in January, he told one of the defense lawyers in the case that he “absolutely” thought the romance began before Ms. Willis hired Mr. Wade.\n\nBut when called to the stand last week, Mr. Bradley said that he had been “speculating.”\n\nIn a filing on Monday, lawyers for David J. Shafer, a co-defendant in the case, said that they had spoken to Ms. Yeager, who said that Mr. Bradley had told her the prosecutors’ relationship began before Mr. Wade went to work for Ms. Willis.\n\nThe filing stated that according to Ms. Yeager, Mr. Bradley told her that “Mr. Wade had definitively begun a romantic relationship with Ms. Willis during the time that Ms. Willis was running for district attorney in 2019 through 2020.”\n\nAccording to the filing, Ms. Yeager said she also overheard Ms. Willis call Mr. Bradley last September, prompted by a news article that mentioned how much her office was paying Mr. Wade and his law partners. (Mr. Bradley’s work for the office was not related to the Trump case.)\n\n“They are coming after us,” Ms. Willis told Mr. Bradley during the call, according to the account offered by Ms. Yeager that is described in the defense filing. “You don’t need to talk to them about anything about us.”\n\nThe context of Ms. Willis’ alleged call to Mr. Bradley is not clear; In any case, it would have taken place before the disqualification effort began in January and before it was known that Mr. Bradley would be subpoenaed to testify.\n\nOn the stand last month, Mr. Bradley testified that he “did not personally know” Ms. Willis. “My interaction with Ms. Willis was never where I would pick up the phone and talk to her,” he said.\n\nAlso unclear is what impact, if any, Ms. Yeager’s statement could have on a judge’s decision whether to disqualify the prosecutors. The judge, Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court, has already wrapped up testimony on the disqualification question; on Friday, he said he would rule on the matter within two weeks.\n\nIn their filing on Monday, Mr. Shafer’s lawyers asked the judge to allow them to put Ms. Yeager on the stand “in the event that the court reopens the hearing to receive additional evidence.” They noted that Mr. Trump and Ms. Willis’s office have also asked the judge to allow for additional testimony.\n\nAt a hearing on Friday, Judge McAfee heard final legal arguments from both sides but said that he could hold another hearing if evidence emerged to require it.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Bradley did not return calls seeking comment. Ms. Yeager, who has run for local office previously as a Republican — but says she currently considers herself a Democrat — declined to comment on the filing on Monday. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office did not comment on Monday, but Ms. Willis and her office have described the disqualification effort as legally baseless and an effort to generate salacious headlines.\n\nIf successful, the effort to remove Ms. Willis would throw the criminal case against Mr. Trump into turmoil, forcing a state agency to find another prosecutor to take it on. A new prosecutor could move to keep, modify or drop the case against Mr. Trump, who was indicted in August with 18 allies on charges of conspiring to overturn the former president’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.\n\nSince then, four defendants have pleaded guilty.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.809854455896326,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Cobb County\n*   Georgia\n*   Fulton County\n*   Atlanta\n*   Fulton County Superior Court"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-66.96461486816406}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.036693Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4dadWeAsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3786},"candidatesTokenCount":37,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":37}],"promptTokenCount":1012,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1012}],"thoughtsTokenCount":449,"totalTokenCount":1498,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.952798+00:00"}

But he said she could do so only if her subordinate, Nathan J. Wade, a special prosecutor with whom she had a romantic relationship, stepped aside. Mr. Wade subsequently resigned from the Trump case, which he had run for more than two years.\n\nBut in Friday’s 51-page filing to the Georgia Court of Appeals, defense lawyers argued that this was not enough. Ms. Willis and her entire office must be disqualified, they said, in order to restore “the public’s faith in the integrity of the judicial system.”\n\nThe defense lawyers maintained that the romance had created an untenable conflict of interest. Judge McAfee, in a March 15 order, found no “actual” conflict. But he said that the romance had created an “appearance of impropriety.”\n\nDefense lawyers said the judge had made a “plain legal error requiring reversal.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the appellate court, which leans conservative, will take up the appeal of the decision by Judge McAfee, who was appointed by the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp. Legal analysts generally regarded his ruling on the disqualification matter as reflecting his cautious approach as he seeks middle ground in the contentious case.\n\nMs. Willis’s office did not comment on the latest filing, though she has zealously defended her conduct. “I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told one of the defense lawyers during testimony this month, as she emphasized that it was the defendants who were on trial for trying to steal an election.\n\nLast weekend, in the wake of the judge’s ruling, she told CNN “I’m not embarrassed by anything I’ve done,” adding that “my greatest crime is I had a relationship with a man, but that’s not something I find embarrassing in any way.”\n\nDefense lawyers highlighted those and other similar comments in their new filing.\n\nJudge McAfee had already given the defendants permission to pursue their appeal. But under Georgia law, the co-defendants must also secure the approval of the Georgia Court of Appeals before the matter can be heard by a panel of three appellate judges. The appeals court has 45 days to decide whether to grant or deny the appeal application.\n\nThe effort to disqualify Ms. Willis led to multiple days of hearings that delved into salacious details of her personal life. Defense lawyers argued that she had engaged in “self-dealing” by taking vacations with Mr. Wade and allowing him to pay for at least some of the cost of the trips.\n\nThey reiterated that criticism in their most recent filing. “No prosecutor has ever been so reckless and relentless in pursuit of personal gain,” they wrote.\n\nJudge McAfee was ultimately unmoved by such arguments. But in his ruling this month, he criticized Ms. Willis for a “tremendous lapse in judgment” in dating Mr. Wade. He also pointed to lingering questions about whether Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade “testified untruthfully,” stating that the hearings had left an “odor of mendacity” hanging over the matter.\n\nThe drama over the romance served to distract from the criminal charges contained in the August indictment of Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies. The charging document described myriad efforts to overturn Mr. Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia, and four of the defendants have since taken plea deals.\n\nDefense lawyers continue to claim that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade lied under oath and in court filings. They also renewed their argument that a speech Ms. Willis gave at an Atlanta church could prejudice a jury. In that speech in January, she suggested that the criticism directed at her and Mr. Wade, both of whom are Black, was motivated by racism.\n\nThe defense lawyers argue that the appeals court needs to step in to clarify whether such behavior should result in the disqualification of a district attorney.\n\nThe Georgia case is one of four criminal cases Mr. Trump is facing, and in each of them, his lawyers have engaged in delaying tactics as the November general election approaches. A Manhattan judge recently set an April 15 trial date for Mr. Trump’s criminal case involving charges that he falsified business records to hide a potential sex scandal. Trial dates have not been set for his two federal criminal cases, in Washington, D.C., and Florida.\n\nJudge McAfee also recently ruled that a pretrial appeal could be sought by Harrison Floyd, a co-defendant in the case who formerly led a group called Black Voices for Trump. The judge had ruled against Mr. Floyd’s contention that prosecutors did not have the authority to pursue election-related charges against him because they did not first seek a referral from the state election board.\n\nAs in the disqualification appeal, Mr. Floyd must first secure the approval of the appellate court before his appeal can go forward.\n\nIt appears increasingly unlikely that the Georgia case will go to trial before the November election, although it is also unclear whether the appeal efforts will contribute to the delay. Judge McAfee has said that he will continue to address other pretrial motions in the case regardless of what the appeals court decides to do with regard to the disqualification effort.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1068894522530692,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Fulton County Superior Court\n*   Georgia Court of Appeals\n*   Georgia\n*   Atlanta (specifically, an Atlanta church)\n*   Manhattan\n*   Washington, D.C.\n*   Florida"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-61.985809326171875}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.798862Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daY7hMPDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4405},"candidatesTokenCount":56,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":56}],"promptTokenCount":1094,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1094}],"thoughtsTokenCount":675,"totalTokenCount":1825,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:37.560675+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Kamran Khan said just like in 2013, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has once again become the ruling party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and an opposition party in the rest of Pakistan. He remarked Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) has to decide whether his party would continue the politics of resistance. He claimed the PTI has adopted an \"aggressive attitude\" and its decision to appoint Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief minister of KP indicates that it has \"initiated an aggressive political innings\".\n\nKhan contacted PTI politician Ali Mohammad Khan and asked him whether the PTI has decided to continue its aggressive politics. Ali Khan said the most important thing is that the mandate given to the party in elections should be accepted. He added Imran Khan does not want the party to remain in an \"aggressive or battling position\" all the time, but protests will continue till it gets its \"right\". He mentioned Imran Khan spoke with him about \"truth and reconciliation\" and said everyone will have to tell the truth. He questioned whether Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would accept that he lost the election and came into power with a \"fake mandate\".\n\nAli Khan said the people of KP voted for the PTI for a third term because it had performed well. He remarked his party does not accept Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister and that is why Gandapur has been made the chief minister of KP and he did not attend the prime minister's oath-taking ceremony. He mentioned Gandapur will perform his state duties but would continue to protest till the party's \"rights\" are given to it.\n\nRelations with other countries\n\nKhan spoke with senior political analyst Husain Haqqani and asked him whether he would agree that the world is not concerned about the issues in elections in Pakistan and wants cordial relations with the new government. Haqqani fully agreed with the view and said it has happened nowhere in the world that governments of other countries have refused to recognise a government after an election. He remarked it is a result of \"political immaturity and lack of understanding\" of international relations that PTI politicians were expecting that upon their expression of reservations about elections, foreign countries would not accept the new government.\n\nKhan asked Haqqani to comment on the congratulatory messages given to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after his election. Haqqani said while messages are a formal activity, the swiftness with which these messages were conveyed in the context of a controversial election proves that all countries want Pakistan to be a stable country. He added Pakistan's stability is in the interest of all countries which have given loans to it. Talking about India, he said it is in a position of an \"economic take off\" and confrontation with Pakistan is an \"irritant\" for it. Therefore, he added, all countries want to engage with Pakistan and improve relations with it.\n\nReplying to Khan's question on how Pakistan can maintain a balance in its relations with China and the United States (US) simultaneously, Haqqani said at present all countries in the world are in search of a \"balanced foreign policy\", and the far eastern countries have recently said that they want relations with both China and the US and would not want to get involved in any conflict between the two countries. He insisted Pakistan will also need to adopt this \"sagacious attitude\" and \"detach emotions from foreign policy\".\n\nSpeaking about the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) programme, Haqqani said Pakistan had to seek loans from the IMF repeatedly because it did not follow the IMF's conditions which were aimed at reforming its economy. He added Pakistan should complete an IMF programme to achieve economic stability. Talking about the need for internal political stability, he insisted \"national reconciliation\" is necessary and if there is no internal harmony, Pakistan will not be able to have any reconciliation or negotiations with other countries.\n\nHaqqani said restoration of Pakistan's relations with the US at the highest level have begun and noted US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken held meetings with Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir during his visit to Washington. He expressed confidence in US Vice President Kamala Harris contacting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the near future. He claimed under Imran Khan's government, there was an issue that nothing was kept confidential. He remarked in \"populism\", the leader wants to say everything which can earn an applause from the public but in diplomacy, \"many things have to be done quietly\".\n\nReplying to Khan's question on whether the US policy towards Pakistan would change if Donald Trump (former US president) or the Republican party comes into office after the November elections, Haqqani said the US foreign policy is based on national interest and not on personalities, so a change in government may not bring any major change in the foreign policy.\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1630 GMT 6 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.8063177968941482,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)\n*   Pakistan\n*   India\n*   China\n*   United States (US)\n*   Washington\n*   Lahore"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-92.12220764160156}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.232563Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dafOYDsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4268},"candidatesTokenCount":51,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":51}],"promptTokenCount":1023,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1023}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1687,"totalTokenCount":2761,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.035687+00:00"}

Tarar said Sharif delivered a \"balanced speech\" and did not talk about political revenge or chaos, instead he spoke about national harmony and reconciliation. He added he spoke about the economy, foreign policy and every section of the society, including labourers, farmers and women.\n\nTarar noted live coverage of Omar Khan's speech was interrupted but claimed it was not in the knowledge of the prime minister or anyone else. He said when pointed out, the deputy speaker took notice immediately and the transmission was resumed. He was of the view that the speech should have been \"transmitted live end to end\" and said he would ask the speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament) to ensure that speeches of the opposition members are covered live.\n\nFarooq played a clip of a statement by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) chief Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman in which he claimed the elections were stolen and the [military] establishment is responsible for the theft. He added this is why the JUI will sit in the opposition this time. Farooq asked Tarar how he would respond to Rehman's allegations. Tarar insisted the election results should be accepted by all. He questioned if the establishment was involved in rigging, then why did Ali Amin Gandapur (PTI politician allegedly involved in the 9 May attacks) win the election and why several prominent PML-N politicians lost the polls. He said complaints about election results should be taken to election tribunals.\n\nTarar said he is against the blocking of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) or any other platform but emphasised that all political parties should agree upon a \"code of conduct\" regarding social media. He remarked 9 May was a \"dangerous plan\" and noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said any prisoner being kept in jail without evidence of involvement in the 9 May incidents should be released.\n\nSenior journalist Mazhar Abbas said he has been demanding that PTV should be a free and independent channel. He noted PTV was to be a national TV channel, but it has been turned into a state-controlled channel. He claimed there is an \"undeclared censorship\" in place at the moment and digital media is being controlled. He was of the view that freeing the media would be a challenge for Sharif's new government.\n\nSpeaking about the allegations of election rigging, Abbas said a \"high-powered commission\" should be formed and all parties should agree that they would accept the findings of the commission. He was of the view that the 9 May cases have been used for political advantage.\n\nFarooq asked analyst Mansoor Ali Khan whether a commission could be formed. Khan claimed the PML-N would never want to form a commission because it has gotten into power and Shehbaz Sharif has been elected as the prime minister. He further claimed there is no need for a commission to investigate as journalists saw that the results were changed. He said Omar Khan's speech was censored because a person holding former prime minister Imran Khan's picture stood on his side and PTV did not want to show that picture. He remarked this is the state of censorship that the country is currently facing.\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 3 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-5.551551818847656,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   National Assembly\n*   jail\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-72.17017364501953}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.046123Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daavoAsCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2933},"candidatesTokenCount":13,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":13}],"promptTokenCount":745,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":745}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1414,"totalTokenCount":2172,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.627362+00:00"}

He noted Dar has been appointed as the foreign minister at a time when Pakistan is facing serious challenges on the foreign policy front and the most important issue is maintaining a balance in its relations with the United States (US) and China.\n\nKhan asked former diplomat Maleeha Lodhi what is the most serious challenge for Pakistan on the foreign policy front. Lodhi replied foreign policy begins at home, so the biggest challenge for Pakistan is its economy as foreign policy cannot be very effective unless the economy improves. She said foreign policy challenges include relations with China, Afghanistan, the US and India, but China is the \"strategic priority\" for Pakistan. Noting that Pakistan has entered the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (mega development project), she said it is important to keep it on a positive trajectory.\n\nLodhi was of the view that it could be a \"declaratory policy\" that Pakistan wants to maintain balance between relations with China and the US, but \"China is its priority, not the US\". She emphasised the country needs to reset its relations with the US but it needs to wait to do so because it is election season there.\n\nTalking about US President Joe Biden's policy towards Pakistan, Lodhi said it seems Biden has a \"blind spot\" for Pakistan as he has never shown any interest in the country throughout his tenure. She noted Donald Trump (former US president) can be re-elected as the president, so Pakistan should be prepared for it.\n\nCommenting on relations with India, Lodhi said if Pakistan wants a working relationship with India, there should be \"reciprocity\" from India as well. She noted it would be a challenge for Pakistan that India has \"completely removed the Kashmir issue from the agenda of bilateral talks\".\n\nSpeaking about Dar as the foreign minister, Lodhi said it should be kept in mind that there is continuity in Pakistan's foreign policy and no matter which government comes to power, there is \"no departure\" in the foreign policy. She added Dar brings a lot of experience even though his experience is in finance and he has a lot of \"international exposure\" as well. She mentioned the foreign ministry, as a highly professional institution, would provide support to him. She claimed Dar enjoys the confidence of the top leadership of the party and \"people take such a foreign minister much more seriously\".\n\nTalks with IMF\n\nKhan said Pakistan needs excellent relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the government wants a new \"larger and longer-term\" IMF programme of at least $7bn. He noted an IMF delegation has arrived in Islamabad (Pakistan's capital) and will begin talks regarding the final tranche of $1.1bn under the current agreement. He mentioned it would be the first test of Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb.\n\nKhan spoke with Uzair Younus, an expert on economic affairs, and asked him whether Pakistan's plan to acquire a new extended IMF programme is achievable. Younus replied it is very much achievable and noted the new finance minister had \"clarity in communication\" when he said Pakistan needs to negotiate for a new longer and larger programme.\n\nYounus said a \"blueprint of the contours of the programme\" already exists, so the focus of negotiations should be on its implementation. He commented if the finance minister comes to Washington (US capital) with an implementation plan, it would not be difficult to negotiate a longer programme. He expressed hope that there would be economic stability in the country in the coming months.\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1630 GMT 13 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6197649442232572,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)\n*   United States (US)\n*   China\n*   Afghanistan\n*   India\n*   Kashmir\n*   Islamabad\n*   Washington\n*   Lahore"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-40.28472137451172}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:31.441825Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"X94daeH7GuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4613},"candidatesTokenCount":65,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":65}],"promptTokenCount":1136,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1136}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1839,"totalTokenCount":3040,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.318235+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The fisherman, Adem Yilmaz, recognized it as one of the white storks that had long summered in the village, he recalled, but he had never seen one so close, much less hosted one on his boat.\n\nWondering if it was hungry, he tossed it a fish, which the bird devoured. He tossed another. And another.\n\nSo began an unlikely tale of man and bird that has captivated Turkey as the passing years — and a deft social media campaign by a local nature photographer — have spread the pair’s story as a modern-day fable of cross-species friendship.\n\nThe stork, nicknamed Yaren, or “companion,” in Turkish, not only returned to Mr. Yilmaz’s boat repeatedly that first year, the fisherman said, but after migrating south for the winter, returned the next spring to the same village, the same nest — and the same boat.\n\nLast month, after Yaren appeared in the village for the 13th year in a row, the local news media gleefully covered his arrival like the springtime sighting of a Turkish Punxsutawney Phil.\n\nThe pair’s story has brought unexpected fame, although no serious fortune, to Mr. Yilmaz, 70, and Yaren, estimated to be 17. They have co-starred in a children’s book and an award-winning documentary. A children’s adventure movie featuring a cameo by Mr. Yilmaz (and a digital rendering of the stork) is expected to debut in cinemas across Turkey this year.\n\nStork lovers everywhere can watch Yaren and his partner, Nazli, or “coquette” in Turkish, as they preen, contort their necks, clack their beaks, renovate their nest and occasionally mate, thanks to a 24-hour webcam set up by the local government.\n\n“This is not a tale. This is a true story,” Ali Ozkan, the mayor of Karacabey, whose district includes the village, said in an interview. “It is a true story with the flavor of a tale.”\n\nThe bird’s celebrity has bolstered municipal efforts to increase local tourism with walking paths and coffee shops near the district’s lakes and wetlands, he said. The area has developed a stork “master plan” to care for the birds.\n\nHe initially faced some criticism from constituents who wondered why a mayor was getting involved with storks, he said. But now, residents call in when they notice damaged nests, and a friend from another city recently phoned him to complain that he could not see Yaren on the webcam.\n\nThe story has put Mr. Yilmaz’s village of Eskikaraagac — population 235 — on the map, drawing groups of students and tourists who stroll its narrow streets to see the storks and take boat rides on neighboring Lake Uluabat. Many visitors seek out Yaren’s nest, which sits on a platform atop an electric pole near Mr. Yilmaz’s house, and act star-struck when they encounter the fisherman himself, peppering him with questions and posing for photographs.\n\nOne recent morning, Mr. Yilmaz stood in the yard of his small, two-story house holding a tub of fish he had caught. In their nest overhead, Yaren and Nazli dozed, groomed themselves and filled the air with the percussive clacking of their beaks.\n\n“Yaren!” Mr. Yilmaz called.\n\nBoth birds glided down to the yard, and Mr. Yilmaz lofted fish into their beaks.\n\n“They are full,” Mr. Yilmaz announced after the birds had downed about two dozen fish. “After 13 years, I can tell.”\n\nStorks have long nested in the village, arriving in the spring and mating before migrating in the late summer toward Africa.\n\nVillage elders recall when there seemed to be a stork nest on every roof and residents struggled to prevent the birds from swiping laundry from outdoor lines. But most people liked the birds, whose arrival right after pink flowers bloomed on the almond trees was a harbinger of spring.\n\nRidvan Cetin, the village’s elected authority, said a count in the 1980s found 41 active nests, meaning 82 storks, not including chicks.\n\nThis year, the village has only four active nests, including Yaren’s.\n\n“Now they are very few,” Mr. Cetin said sadly.\n\nNo one in the village could recall a bond similar to that between Mr. Yilmaz and Yaren.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Mr. Cetin said.\n\nFor Mr. Yilmaz, a quiet man with leathery hands and a kind, rutted face, Yaren was a serendipitous addition to what he had hoped would be a late, restful chapter in an otherwise difficult life.\n\nHe grew up poor. His father pulled him out of school to work in the fields and fish, no matter how cold the weather.\n\n“My life was between the field and the lake,” he said.\n\nHis mother died when he was 13. His father remarried when he was 17 to a woman Mr. Yilmaz did not like. So, with only an elementary school education, he fled to Bursa, the nearest big city, and worked in a factory that made yogurt and other milk products.\n\nAt 19, he married another villager he had known since childhood. They lost their first child, a daughter, weeks after her birth. He worked in different milk factories as he and his wife raised three other children, two boys and a girl.\n\nIn 2011, with his children grown and living elsewhere with his five grandchildren, he stopped working, returned to the village and moved back into his childhood home, next to the lake where he had fished as a child.\n\n“It was my dream from the day I started working to go to my village and fish,” he said.\n\nSoon after, the stork landed on his boat.\n\nEach time Yaren left, Mr. Yilmaz wondered whether he would return. But after a few years, he stopped worrying.\n\n“I was sure that as long as I was alive, this bird was going to return,” he said.\n\nEarly on, no one much cared that Mr. Yilmaz had made friends with a stork. Other villagers teased him or said he was wasting his time — and his fish.\n\nThat changed in year five, when Alper Tuydes, a hunter turned wildlife photographer who works for the local government, began sharing photographs of the pair on social media. The story spread, getting a lift each spring with Yaren’s arrival.\n\nThe relationship of man and bird corresponds with known stork behaviors, said Omer Donduren, a Turkish ornithologist.\n\nAlthough storks avoid direct contact with people, they often roost near them, on roofs, in chimneys or atop electricity poles.\n\nThe birds tend toward monogamy and display loyalty to their nests, parting ways with their partners to migrate, but rendezvousing in the same nest in the spring to reproduce.\n\nThat could explain why Yaren has roosted near Mr. Yilmaz’s house year after year, Mr. Donduren said.\n\nStorks, which can live for more than 20 years in the wild and more than 30 in captivity, also have strong memories, enabling them to remember migration routes from as far north as Poland and Germany to destinations many thousands of miles south, as far as South Africa. It is unclear where Yaren spends his time after he leaves the village, but a tracker affixed to one of his offspring followed the bird over Syria, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic before it stopped working.\n\nOver time, Yaren’s experiences with Mr. Yilmaz have probably become part of his memory, he said.\n\n“Nature doesn’t have much space for emotions,” Mr. Donduren said. “For the stork, it is a matter of easy food. It thinks, There is an easy source of food here. This man seems safe. He doesn’t hurt me.”\n\nMr. Yilmaz’s explanation is much simpler.\n\n“It is just to love an animal,” he said. “They are God’s creatures.”\n\nOne recent morning, Mr. Yilmaz rowed into the lake and pulled up his net, dropping small fish into the boat.\n\n“Yaren!” he called.\n\nThe stork took flight, did a loop to surveil the boat and perched on a lamppost near the bank.\n\n“Yaren!” Mr. Yilmaz called again.\n\nThe bird took flight again, finally alighting on the boat, where Mr. Yilmaz tossed him fish after fish.\n\nAfter a while, the stork lifted off, glided around the village and returned to his nest.\n\n“That’s it,” Mr. Yilmaz said with a satisfied smile. “He is full.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.3551007784329927,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Turkey\n*   Karacabey (district)\n*   Eskikaraagac (village)\n*   Lake Uluabat\n*   Africa\n*   Bursa\n*   Poland\n*   Germany\n*   South Africa\n*   Syria\n*   Jordan\n*   Israel\n*   Egypt\n*   Sudan\n*   Chad\n*   Central African Republic"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-123.31417083740234}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.006171Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daZswwraY0A-gjZHQAg","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6456},"candidatesTokenCount":91,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":91}],"promptTokenCount":1899,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1899}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1207,"totalTokenCount":3197,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.535046+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The Russian Defense Ministry said that Moscow’s military and security forces killed 234 fighters while thwarting the incursion. In a statement, the ministry blamed the attack on the “Kyiv regime” and “Ukraine’s terrorist formations,” insisting that the Russian military and border forces were able to stop the attackers and avert a cross-border raid. It also said the attackers lost seven tanks and five armored vehicles.\n\nThe reports of border fighting earlier on Tuesday were murky, and it was impossible to ascertain with any certainty what was unfolding in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. Cross-border attacks in the area have occurred sporadically since the war began and have been the subject of claims and counterclaims, as well as disinformation and propaganda.\n\nSoldiers who Kyiv officials say are Russian volunteers fighting for Ukraine claimed to have crossed the border. The Freedom of Russia Legion, the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Siberian Battalion released statements and videos on social media claiming to show them on Russian territory. They said they wanted “a Russia liberated from Putin’s dictatorship.”\n\nThe authenticity of the videos couldn’t be independently verified.\n\nFighters coming out of Ukraine attempted to reach the town of Tetkino, which lies close to the border, according to the governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Roman Starovoit. He said Tetkino was being shelled.\n\n“There was an attempt by a sabotage and reconnaissance group to break through. There was a shooting battle, but there was no breakthrough,” he said in a video message on Telegram.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the Tetkino attacks were driven back, but provided no further details.\n\nIt also said Ukrainian fighters made at least four attempts to cross into the Belgorod region but all attacks were repelled by warplanes, artillery and missiles.\n\nThe representative of Ukraine’s intelligence agency, Andrii Yusov, told Ukrainska Pravda that the military groups are made up of Russian citizens.\n\n“On the territory of the Russian Federation, they operate completely autonomously and independently,” he said.\n\nIn May, Russia alleged that dozens of Ukrainian militants crossed into one of its border towns in the Belgorod region, striking targets and forcing an evacuation, before more than 70 of the attackers were killed or pushed back by what the authorities termed a counterterrorism operation. Ukrainian officials have denied any link with the group.\n\nMeanwhile, one Ukrainian drone struck and set ablaze an oil refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, according to regional governor Gleb Nikitin. That region is located some about 775 kilometers (480 miles) from the Ukraine border.\n\nIn another deep strike, a drone was shot down in the Moscow region, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Though it was brought down well south of the city center, the drone was close to Zhukovsky Airport, one of Mocow’s four international airports.\n\nAnother drone hit an oil depot in Oryol, 116 kilometers (95 miles) from Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last year that his country had developed a weapon that hit a target 700 kilometers (400 miles) away, in an apparent reference to drones.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian drones were also intercepted Tuesday over the Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, Leningrad and Tula regions of Russia.\n\nKyiv has staged increasingly bold attacks behind the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line running through eastern and southern Ukraine. It has also increasingly deployed sea drones in the Black Sea, where it claims to have sunk Russian warships.\n\nKyiv’s forces are hoping for more military supplies from Ukraine’s Western partners, but in the meantime are struggling against a bigger and better-provisioned Russian army that is pressing hard at certain front-line points inside Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy said that recent Russian advances have been halted and that the battlefield situation is now significantly better than in the past three months.\n\n“We had some difficulties due to the lack of artillery shells, long-range weapons, sky blocking and the high density of Russian drones,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with France’s BFM TV and Le Monde published late Monday on the Ukrainian presidential website.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, an Il-76 heavy-lift transport plane of the Russian air force with 15 people on board crashed while taking off from an air base in the Ivanovo region in western Russia, the Defense Ministry said. Its statement didn't specify whether there were any survivors. The ministry said that an engine fire during takeoff was the likely cause of the crash.\n\nIn Ukraine, three people were killed and 44 more were wounded on Tuesday evening as the result of a Russian missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, Ukrainian officials said. Serhii Lysak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region where the city if located, said two residential buildings were damaged.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.36736511602634336,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":744,"startIndex":520,"uri":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/russia-says-it-killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-1.6804410"},{"endIndex":843,"startIndex":628,"uri":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-says-russia-124031300023_1.html"},{"endIndex":1336,"startIndex":993,"uri":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-says-russia-124031300023_1.html"},{"endIndex":1827,"startIndex":1474,"uri":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-says-russia-124031300023_1.html"},{"endIndex":2223,"startIndex":2018,"uri":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/russia-says-it-killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-1.6804410"},{"endIndex":3389,"startIndex":3046,"uri":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/russia-says-it-killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-1.6804410"},{"endIndex":5023,"startIndex":4797,"uri":"https://www.ktvu.com/news/russia-says-it-killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine"},{"endIndex":5380,"startIndex":5151,"uri":"https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/1551006/german-diplomat-warns-iran-repercussions-its-espionage"},{"endIndex":5900,"startIndex":5644,"uri":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/russia-says-it-killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-1.6804410"},{"endIndex":6694,"startIndex":6374,"uri":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/russia-says-it-killed-234-fighters-while-thwarting-an-incursion-from-ukraine-1.6804410"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Moscow\n*   Kyiv\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia (and Russian Federation)\n*   Kursk region\n*   Belgorod region\n*   Tetkino\n*   Nizhny Novgorod region\n*   Moscow region\n*   Zhukovsky Airport\n*   Oryol\n*   Bryansk region\n*   Leningrad region\n*   Tula region\n*   Black Sea\n*   France\n*   Ivanovo region\n*   Kryvyi Rih\n*   Dnipropetrovsk region"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-45.185909271240234}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.495520Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daaCfHsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4285},"candidatesTokenCount":123,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":123}],"promptTokenCount":1059,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1059}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1811,"totalTokenCount":2993,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.657664+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Mr. Putin said the vote represented a desire for “internal consolidation” that would allow Russia to “act effectively at the front line” as well as in other spheres, such as the economy.\n\nThe government was dismissive of a protest organized by Russia’s beleaguered opposition, in which people expressed dissent by flooding polling places at noon. A correspondent for the state-run Rossiya 24 channel said that “provocations at polling stations were nothing more than mosquito bites.” Official commentators suggested that the lines showed a zeal for democratic participation.\n\nMr. Putin, 71, will now be president until at least 2030, entering a fifth term in a country whose Constitution ostensibly limits presidents to two. The vote, the first since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, was designed to both create a public mandate for the war and restore Mr. Putin’s image as the embodiment of stability. Still, Russians are somewhat edgy over what changes the vote might bring.\n\nHere are five takeaways:\n\nWhile the victory was a foregone conclusion, Putin’s numbers exceeded expectations.\n\nThere is a pattern to presidential votes involving Mr. Putin: His results get better each time. In 2012, he received 63.6 percent of the vote, and in 2018, after presidential terms were extended to six years, he got 76.7 percent. Pundits were expecting the Kremlin to peg the result at around 80 percent this time, but Mr. Putin received an even higher percentage, closer to 90 percent, although the count wasn’t yet final.\n\nThe loyal opposition parties barely registered. None of the three other candidates who were allowed on the ballot received more than five percent of the vote.\n\nPresidential votes in Russia have long served as a means to make the entire system seem legitimate. But such a large margin of victory for Mr. Putin — who has reworked the Constitution to let him stay in the Kremlin until 2036, when he will be 83 — risks undermining that. It could raise questions in an increasingly authoritarian Kremlin about why Russia needs such a make-believe exercise.\n\nThe Kremlin did not entirely achieve the image of national unity that it sought.\n\nMr. Putin always seeks to project an image of political stability and control, which the carefully choreographed presidential votes are designed to burnish. But there were three events linked to opposition politics that marred that image this time around.\n\nThe first was in January, when thousands of Russians across the country lined up to sign the petitions needed to place Boris Nadezhdin, a previously low-profile politician who opposed the war in Ukraine, on the ballot. The Kremlin kept him off it.\n\nThen Aleksei A. Navalny, Mr. Putin’s staunchest political opponent, died suddenly in an Arctic prison in February. Thousands of mourners who showed up at his funeral in Moscow chanted against Mr. Putin and the war, and even during the voting, mourners continued to place flowers on his grave.\n\nThe Navalny organization had endorsed the plan for voters to turn up in large numbers at noon, in a silent protest against Mr. Putin and the war. Mr. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who voted at the Russian Embassy in Berlin, said she had written her husband’s name on her ballot and thanked all those who had waited in long lines as part of the protest.\n\nBut it was difficult to see how the protest could translate into any kind of sustained movement, especially in the face of repressive measures that have grown steadily harsher since the Ukraine war started in February 2022. Mr. Putin’s government, for example, detained hundreds of people as they publicly mourned Mr. Navalny.\n\nMr. Putin will claim a popular mandate to pursue the war in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Putin’s campaign, and the vote itself, has been framed by the war. His December announcement that he would seek another term came in response to a question from a war veteran who appealed to him to run. The symbol of the election, a check mark in the blue, white and red of the Russian flag, resembled the V also sometimes used to show support for Russian soldiers.\n\nVoting took place in occupied regions of Ukraine, even though Russia does not fully control the four regions that it annexed. There were elements of coercion, with poll workers sometimes bringing ballot boxes to people’s homes accompanied by an armed soldier. In the occupied regions, Mr. Putin’s margin of victory was even higher than in Russia itself.\n\nMr. Putin has never acknowledged that he started a war by invading Ukraine. Rather, he says he was forced to mount a “special military operation” to prevent the West from using Ukraine as a Trojan horse to undermine Russia.\n\nHe described the election turnout, reported at over 74 percent of more than 112 million registered voters, as “due to the fact that we are forced in the literal sense of the word, with weapons in our hands, to protect the interests of our citizens, our people.”\n\nThe war will continue to be an organizing principle for the Kremlin.\n\nIn his annual address to the nation in February, which served as his main campaign speech, Mr. Putin promised both guns and butter, asserting that Russia could pursue its war aims even while investing in the economy, infrastructure and longstanding goals like boosting the Russian population.\n\nWith an estimated 40 percent of public expenditure going to military spending, the economy grew by 3.6 percent in 2023, according to government statistics. Production of munitions and other matériel is booming.\n\nMr. Putin has also suggested that war veterans should form the core of a “new elite” to run the country, because their service proved their commitment to Russia’s best interests. That proposal is expected to accelerate a trend of public officials expressing muscular patriotism, especially as Mr. Putin seeks to replace his older allies with a younger generation.\n\nRussians are uneasy about what happens next.\n\nThe period after any presidential election is when the Kremlin habitually introduces unpopular policies. After 2018, for example, Mr. Putin raised the retirement age. Russians are speculating about whether a new military mobilization or increased domestic repression could be around the corner.\n\nMr. Putin has repeatedly denied that another mobilization is needed, but recent small territorial gains in eastern Ukraine are believed to have cost tens of thousands of casualties. Although Mr. Putin has suggested that he is ready for peace talks, so far neither side has shown much flexibility.\n\nRussia has annexed more than 18 percent of Ukrainian territory, and the battle lines have been static for months. Any new Russian offensive is expected to take place during the warm, dry summer months, and the Russian military might try to increase the amount of territory it controls before any future negotiations.\n\n“The decisions will be more likely about war than about peace, more likely military than social or even economic,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist in exile in Berlin.\n\nMilana Mazaeva contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.912544189937531,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1188,"startIndex":964,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":1502,"startIndex":1206,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":1633,"startIndex":1381,"uri":"https://news.nestia.com/detail_share/12343583?media_type=1"},{"endIndex":2148,"startIndex":1800,"uri":"https://news.nestia.com/detail_share/12343583?media_type=1"},{"endIndex":2949,"startIndex":2692,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":3398,"startIndex":3122,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":3607,"startIndex":3275,"uri":"https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-march-11-18-2024"},{"endIndex":4012,"startIndex":3782,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/17/five-takeaways-from-putins-orchestrated-win-in-russia/"},{"endIndex":4410,"startIndex":4203,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":4708,"startIndex":4487,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":4814,"startIndex":4595,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/17/five-takeaways-from-putins-orchestrated-win-in-russia/"},{"endIndex":5336,"startIndex":4967,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":5675,"startIndex":5387,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":6014,"startIndex":5801,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":6675,"startIndex":6458,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/17/five-takeaways-from-putins-orchestrated-win-in-russia/"},{"endIndex":7158,"startIndex":6813,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/17/five-takeaways-from-putins-orchestrated-win-in-russia/"},{"endIndex":7328,"startIndex":7038,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"},{"endIndex":8189,"startIndex":7965,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/17/five-takeaways-from-putins-orchestrated-win-in-russia/"},{"endIndex":8575,"startIndex":8288,"uri":"https://ca.yahoo.com/news/russia-claims-300-ukrainian-soldiers-075916463.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Kremlin (referring to the seat of government in Moscow)\n*   Arctic (in \"Arctic prison\")\n*   Moscow\n*   Berlin\n*   Russian Embassy in Berlin\n*   eastern Ukraine"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-57.49028396606445}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.883513Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dabn2NZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5927},"candidatesTokenCount":63,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":63}],"promptTokenCount":1473,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1473}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2168,"totalTokenCount":3704,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:47.431177+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Five of these new, large-scale works were commissioned by a department of Hong Kong’s government for its outdoor art project, “Art@Harbour,” the harbor being Victoria Harbor, which separates Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon Peninsula.\n\nAnother piece was jointly commissioned by M+, Hong Kong’s contemporary art museum, and Art Basel Hong Kong. That work, a new black-and-white film by the Chinese artist and filmmaker Yang Fudong, “Sparrow on the Sea,” will be projected on the museum’s facade nightly.\n\nOne of the “Art@Harbour” projects, “Schrödinger’s Bed,” is by the Hong Kong artist Dylan Kwok.\n\nMr. Kwok’s work is named after Schrödinger’s cat, the famous thought experiment by the theoretical physicist Erwin Schrödinger.\n\nThat experiment, which the scientist proposed as a commentary on quantum mechanics, suggests that, if a cat is inside a sealed box with something which may kill it, it is impossible to know whether the cat is alive or dead until you observe the cat. So, until you open the box, the cat is at once both dead and alive.\n\nMr. Kwok explained by email that his installation, in Tamar Park, a waterfront green space in the Admiralty district, “consists of nine futuristic daybeds that are placed in a tic-tac-toe alignment. Six inflatable cats in checkerboard patterns are (randomly) seated or lay on six daybeds out of the total of nine.” These outdoor couches are programmed to glow in differing patterns from 6 p.m. to midnight, he added, to surprise visitors sitting on them.\n\n“Laying down on a bench seems to be a taboo in any public park, needless to say,” Mr. Kwok added. “Having a bed as urban furniture is only a daydream.” So, he said, the pieces are meant to provoke conversations about public space.\n\nMr. Kwok also said the experiment “made us think differently about the nature of reality.”\n\n“The cat in the box can be both dead and alive, at the same time, before observations,” he said. “We can only know if the person sitting on the bench is truly sleeping (or awake) only when trying to wake them up.” The installation, he added, asks observers, “How do we want our public life to be? Can we introduce daybeds in our parks?”\n\nAnother piece of the “Art@Harbour” exhibition, also in Tamar Park, is by teamLab, a Tokyo international art collective.\n\nThat two-work exhibition, “teamLab: Continuous,” consists of giant glowing ovoids and trees arrayed across land and sea.\n\nThe collective explained in a news release that the egg-shaped forms in “Resonating Life which Continues to Stand,” the first of the two works, stand resolutely, no matter where they are.\n\n“The ovoids continue to stand even if they are pushed over by waves, blown by the wind, or pushed by people,” the artists said. “When an ovoid is pushed over, it rises back up on its own and shines brightly.” That light, and the sound the ovoid produces, resonates with other ovoids and trees nearby.\n\nThe team added: “When it is quiet and the wind is not blowing and the people nearby are not interacting with the ovoids, their lights begin to flicker slowly.”\n\nAccording to teamLab, in the second work, “Resonating Trees,” the light of the trees responds to the light of the ovoids. As they respond, the trees may change color.\n\nAnother installation in Tamar Park, “Harbour Cup,” by the Hong Kong firm Laab Architects, consists of foosball-inspired sculptures.\n\nAsked about the inspiration for the work, Laab Architects said by email, “When we looked for inspiration at the site, we noticed that a lot of people actually came here to exercise. That’s how the sports theme came about. We want to create an artwork that blends in with people’s daily lives, but with a little something off that breaks people’s habit, or makes people rethink the ways of doing things.”\n\nThe firm took the sports theme as a jumping-off point, but then played with it. “‘Harbour Cup’ has no goals on either end and no clear definition of teams, people have to negotiate with each other on how to play,” the architects explained. “Through play, we hope that people can get to talk to each other more, no matter they are family, friends, acquaintances, or strangers.”\n\nThe “Art@Harbour” works will be on display from Monday, just before Art Basel opens, through June 2.\n\n“Sparrow on the Sea,” which Mr. Yang filmed in Hong Kong, features what M+ described in a news release as scenes from “picturesque seaside villages” and “nocturnal city streets.”\n\nMr. Yang said by email that his film was inspired by beloved movies set in Hong Kong, such as “In the Mood for Love,” and that its soundtrack will be provided by the city’s “ambient sounds, of seawater, boats, cars, people and those inside the buildings.”\n\n“Each viewer can have their own unique imagination, combining the sounds that they hear in this city and the visual they see from the work,” he said.\n\nThe film will be projected on the museum’s facade from Friday to June 9.\n\nAngelle Siyang-Le, director of Art Basel Hong Kong, said by email that the fair hopes the outdoor art will “attract a diverse range of audiences, both local and international, who are interested in engaging with the vibrant art scenes of Asia.”\n\n“By offering an immersive experience that highlights diverse artistic perspectives, the goal is to connect guests from around the world in Hong Kong,” she said. “This includes art enthusiasts, collectors, curators, scholars and individuals interested in exploring and appreciating contemporary art from Asia and beyond.”\n\nAsked about the importance of interactive art today, Laab Architects said, “We are so used to looking at our phone these days and become unaware of each other’s presence. This is where interactive art comes into play, to disrupt this kind of presence-non-presence situation, to break a little routine, to create genuine connections, even though the connection may just be a fleeting moment.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7413716242863582,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":761,"startIndex":517,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":1979,"startIndex":1666,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":2547,"startIndex":2294,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":2832,"startIndex":2588,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":3315,"startIndex":2985,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":4254,"startIndex":3940,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":5327,"startIndex":4909,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":5725,"startIndex":5351,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":6392,"startIndex":6136,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":6987,"startIndex":6743,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":7410,"startIndex":7088,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"},{"endIndex":7885,"startIndex":7498,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/21/giant-neon-eggs-and-other-outdoor-art-to-see-in-hong-kong-this-spring/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Hong Kong\n*   Victoria Harbor\n*   Hong Kong Island\n*   Kowloon Peninsula\n*   M+ (Hong Kong’s contemporary art museum)\n*   Tamar Park\n*   Admiralty district\n*   Tokyo\n*   Asia"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-48.18915557861328}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.499555Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daeO-HuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4904},"candidatesTokenCount":65,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":65}],"promptTokenCount":1330,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1330}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2034,"totalTokenCount":3429,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:47.084173+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: What followed was an impassioned monologue by Mr. Johnson in which he explained why continued American aid to Kyiv was, in his view, vital -- a message starkly at odds with the hard-right views that have overtaken his party. He invoked his political roots as a Reagan Republican, denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a ''madman'' and conceded the issue had forced him to walk a ''delicate political tightrope.''\n\nReminded by Ms. Colgan, a member of the American Coalition for Ukraine, a nonprofit advocacy group, of the adage that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was for good people to do nothing, Mr. Johnson replied that he kept a copy of the quotation framed in his office.\n\n''That's not going to be us,'' he assured her. ''We're going to do our job.''\n\nThe exchange reflects what Mr. Johnson has privately told donors, foreign leaders and fellow members of Congress in recent weeks, according to extensive notes Ms. Colgan took during the New Jersey event and interviews with several other people who have spoken with him.\n\nWhile the speaker has remained noncommittal about any one option, he has repeatedly expressed a personal desire to send aid to Ukraine -- something he has voted against repeatedly in the past -- and now appears to be in search of the least politically damaging way to do it.\n\nThe challenge for Mr. Johnson is that any combination of aid measures he puts to a vote will likely infuriate the growing isolationist wing of his party, which considers the issue toxic. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who has repeatedly said she would call a snap vote to unseat the speaker if he allowed a vote for Ukraine aid before imposing restrictive immigration measures, filed a resolution on Friday calling for his removal, saying she wanted to send him ''a warning.''\n\nEven if Ms. Greene follows through on the threat, Mr. Johnson could still hold onto his job. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, has said he believed ''a reasonable number'' of Democrats would vote to save the speaker were he to face a Republican mutiny for acting on the Senate-passed aid package, though on Friday Mr. Jeffries said that had been ''an observation, not a declaration.''\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Friday after Ms. Greene had filed her resolution and the House departed Washington for its Easter recess, Mr. Johnson said that when lawmakers returned in two weeks, they would ''take the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request.''\n\n''We have done important work discussing options with members,'' he said, ''and are preparing to complete our plan for action.''\n\nPrivately, Mr. Johnson has expressed an interest in linking Ukraine aid to a measure aimed at forcing the Biden administration to reverse its moratorium on liquid natural gas exports, according to three people familiar with his deliberations who were not authorized to discuss them. Mr. Johnson pressed the issue at a White House meeting last month with President Biden and congressional leaders, arguing that by prohibiting new exports of domestic energy, the administration was increasing reliance on Russian gas, effectively enriching Ukraine's enemy.\n\nIn that meeting, according to a person familiar with the comments, Mr. Johnson raised the case of Calcasieu Pass 2, a proposed export terminal that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles, La., and would dwarf the country's existing export terminals. The Biden administration in January had paused a decision on whether to approve it.\n\nHe has puzzled over whether to put the aid to a vote on the House floor packaged with assistance for other U.S. allies, including Israel and Taiwan, or allow lawmakers to vote on them separately to register their support for each individual nation.\n\nWith many Republicans bent on blocking aid to Ukraine, any legislation carrying it would need to be considered using a special procedure that bypasses House rules and requires a two-thirds majority for passage, relying heavily on votes from Democrats. But a combined aid package for both Ukraine and Israel like the one that passed the Senate last month could be doomed by a coalition of right-wing Republicans opposing the money for Kyiv and left-wing Democrats opposing aid for Israel.\n\nMr. Johnson has pondered imposing new sanctions against Russia. And he has debated how the money should be structured -- straight assistance versus a loan -- and whether it should be exclusively for lethal aid, a type of assistance that is more widely supported by his conference, or also include nonmilitary assistance.\n\n''There is a big distinction in the minds of a lot of people between lethal aid for Ukraine, and the humanitarian component,'' Mr. Johnson said at a news conference at the Capitol last week.\n\nBoth he and Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have publicly floated the idea of paying for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen using legislation called the REPO Act.\n\nMr. Johnson has faced mounting international pressure to allow a vote on aid to Ukraine, fielding almost weekly visits and calls from NATO allies and pro-Ukraine activists both at his offices in Washington and Louisiana. When Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland visited Washington earlier this month, he had a sharp public message for the speaker.\n\n''This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,'' Mr. Tusk told reporters. ''The absence of this positive decision of Mr. Johnson will really cost thousands of lives there -- children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.''\n\nMeeting privately with Mr. Johnson in his office in the Capitol, President Andrzej Duda of Poland appealed to the Louisiana Republican's respect for President Ronald Reagan, whose portrait hung beside the speaker during the meeting. Mr. Duda quoted Mr. Reagan extensively and praised his willingness to call out good versus evil during the Cold War, according to a person familiar with the comments who requested anonymity to describe them.\n\nSome skeptical Ukraine backers, both on and off Capitol Hill, have fretted that Mr. Johnson's agreeable comments have simply reflected his penchant for telling people what they want to hear. Early in Mr. Johnson's tenure as speaker, lawmakers noticed that he had a habit of leaving listeners from warring factions with the impression he agreed with each of them.\n\nYet at the fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, he was fairly candid about his calculations.\n\nMr. Johnson told the audience that he was ''working to figure out the best route forward,'' Ms. Colgan recalled, adding that he said that half of House Republicans wanted to move it together as a package with Israel and Taiwan, and the other half wanted to do it on its own.\n\nAt a separate fund-raiser in Binghamton for a congressman in New York's Hudson Valley last month, Christina Zawerucha, the executive director of the Together for Ukraine Foundation, and Anatoliy Pradun, the group's president, who was born and raised in Ukraine, approached the speaker to press him on holding a vote.\n\nMr. Pradun had hoped to appeal to Mr. Johnson's faith by telling him of the strong evangelical Christian community in Ukraine. But realizing they had little time to make their case, Ms. Zawerucha and Mr. Pradun instead gave the speaker a pin with the Ukrainian and American flags, showed him their poster advertising an upcoming interfaith vigil for Ukraine and implored him to schedule a vote on aid to Kyiv.\n\n''He didn't turn us away,'' Ms. Zawerucha said. ''He pointed at our poster and said, 'I will take care of this. I will take care of this.'''\n\nWhen Ms. Zawerucha relayed the interaction to fellow activists after the luncheon, they asked what she thought he meant.\n\n''And at this point, I don't know,'' she said.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Raza asked Dastgir why he lost the election even after showing an \"excellent performance\" as a minister during the previous government.&#160;Dastgir said the election did not seem to be tough during the campaign but on the election day, and even after that, several incidents took place against which he has been seeking a \"legal recourse\".\n\nResponding to Raza's question on why he could not resolve the issues in the power sector as the minister, Dastgir said the previous government made huge progress in power generation by adding 5,000 megawatts to the system. He added the government also improved the power transmission system and new technology was introduced in distribution to stop power theft. He noted the power sector circular debt, which was 2,500bn rupees ($8.9bn) under the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, was reduced to 2,300bn rupees ($8.2bn).\n\nDastgir said consumers assess the performance through electricity bills and the bills had increased after an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He was of the view that the biggest challenge for the incoming government would be to reduce electricity bills and give relief to the people. He noted during the 16 months of the PML-N-led government, several measures were taken and he is hopeful that the next government would move forward in this regard. He remarked he would be ready to provide \"guidance and assistance\" to the new government.\n\nSpeaking about the government's policy on alternate energy, Dastgir said the government already has a plan to \"immediately add 10,000 megawatts of solar energy to the power system\". He noted solar energy is much cheaper but is \"not a solution to all the issues\", yet a major relief could be provided to the people in the next two or three years.\n\nTalking about the payment of independent power producers (IPPs), Dastgir said the initial contracts or the capacity payment agreements of many of the IPPs which had started working during the 1990s would expire in the next two or three years, freeing the country of a \"major burden\". He noted the two big dams which are under construction would be completed by 2026 or 2027 and more hydro power would be available. He expressed hope that in the next five or six years, the situation would be far better and the government might be in a position to provide relief to the people.\n\nDastgir claimed the issue of electricity theft in several areas is a \"governance crisis more than an electricity crisis\" and said prime minister-elect Shehbaz Sharif's government will have to work on the issue. He mentioned the previous government which was in power for only 16 months had made a plan for solar cell manufacturing, battery manufacturing and converting petrol-consuming two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles to alternate energy, and said the new government could implement the plan immediately.\n\nOn the political situation, Dastgir said he does not see the opposition as a \"big challenge\" because it threatens the government of blocking legislation in the parliament but that is an issue of \"temporary management\" and \"cannot create hurdles in governance\". He added the opposition cannot obstruct the government from delivering to the people of Pakistan.\n\nSpeaking about Shehbaz Sharif's call for a \"charter of reconciliation\", Dastgir said the PML-N is always ready for reconciliation with all parties, but there is one \"red line\" and that is the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of the then-chairperson Imran Khan). He added the \"planners, abettors and executors\" of the 9 May attacks will have to face the law in its \"strictest sense\" because the state cannot tolerate another attack. However, he said, if there are people who have been imprisoned but were not involved in the incidents, they would certainly be released. He argued the issue is that the opposition has declared all its opponents \"traitors and infidels\". He commented the opposition should \"show maturity\" in the parliament and Shehbaz Sharif would be ready to shake hands with everyone.\n\nDastgir said the new government would also face a big \"communication challenge\" as it would have to tell the nation the truth on how big the challenges are and how it would address them. Noting that \"no one listens to press conferences now\" and interest in watching TV talk shows is also declining, he suggested communication through mobile phones would be needed to inform the people about the issues, programmes and achievements.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 4 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-4.891359217026654,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"The locations mentioned in the article are:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-83.15310668945313}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.541559Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dafeGIcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3853},"candidatesTokenCount":17,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":17}],"promptTokenCount":984,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":984}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1475,"totalTokenCount":2476,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.43028+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: With no elected president in office and a prime minister widely seen as illegitimate, calls for the government’s ouster are now being heard from an unlikely source: a brigade of armed officers ostensibly responsible for protecting environmentally sensitive areas.\n\nArmed uniformed members of the brigade clashed with government forces in northern Haiti this week, heightening tensions in an already volatile nation where gangs have seized control over large swaths of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and are wreaking havoc in rural areas.\n\nThe environmental group, the Brigade for the Security of Protected Areas (known as B-SAP), became angry after the prime minister fired its leader. On Wednesday, the group’s officers attempted to invade the local customs office, and Haitian National Police units repelled them using tear gas.\n\nJust as worrisome to analysts is the allegiance some of the group’s leaders have publicly declared to Guy Philippe, a former police commander and coup-plotter who recently returned to Haiti after serving six years in a U.S. federal prison.\n\nIn the less than 60 days since Mr. Philippe returned home, he has been traveling the country, shoring up support for his so-called revolution.\n\n“We’re talking about a revolution, but not a revolution in blood,” Mr. Philippe said in an interview. “We haven’t killed anyone. It’s all about peaceful demonstrations.”\n\nMr. Philippe was a leader of the 2004 coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Wanted for years by the United States for drug trafficking, Mr. Philippe lived freely in southern Haiti as a fugitive.\n\nHe was arrested in 2017, just before taking office as an elected senator, sentenced in U.S. federal court to nine years for money laundering and was deported to Haiti in November, which many experts saw as an astonishing move bound to inflame a troubled political landscape.\n\n“This is a guy who has been maneuvering and plotting for 20 years to seize power in Haiti,” said James B. Foley, who was the U.S. ambassador there during the 2004 coup. “We indicted him, extradited him and sidelined him, and now we have sent him back into a Haiti that is in total anarchy, and the result is obvious and predictable and horrible.”\n\nMr. Philippe, who has been living in his home base, Pestel, Haiti, since his return, said he planned to go to Port-au-Prince in the coming days to stage protests, and expected that the vast majority of the population would support him in demanding the resignation of the prime minister, Ariel Henry.\n\nBecause many Haitians are disappointed in the National Police’s inability to tackle the gangs, Mr. Philippe may be right, analysts said.\n\n“If it was a coup, it would be a legitimate coup, but we’re not making any coup,” Mr. Philippe said. “We’re not here to seize power with force.”\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Mr. Henry said he was alarmed by the inappropriate actions of many members of B-SAP, which he noted had no legal or administrative framework. News coverage of the rogue officers risked creating confusion about the environmental surveillance group’s legitimate work, he said. On Tuesday, he added, the government created a commission to review the agency’s work.\n\nAs for Mr. Philippe, the prime minister’s office said, “Ariel Henry is responsible for applying the law.”\n\nThe United States has strongly pushed for a planned security mission to Haiti led by Kenya, which some analysts view as a tacit endorsement of Mr. Henry’s leadership.\n\nMr. Philippe said he “has friends” in the environmental group in the north, an alliance that could prove dangerous. Haiti, once home to a secret police force known as the tonton macoutes, has a long history of paramilitary forces that commit atrocities.\n\nMr. Philippe said he considered the head of the environmental brigade “an ally” with the same aim of getting the prime minister to step down.\n\nAccording to a local newspaper, Mr. Philippe and the brigade are coordinating efforts aimed at opposing the current government.\n\n“B-SAP is not the armed wing of the opposition,” said Jeantel Joseph, who was fired this week as the head of the agency, and led the group’s protests this week.\n\nMr. Joseph said he and Mr. Philippe belong to a larger consortium of political parties, trade unions and grass roots organizations committed to ending Mr. Henry’s time in office — peacefully, he added. With their two movements — Mr. Joseph in the north and Mr. Philippe in the south – the prime minister will have to back down, he said.\n\nThe environmental brigade he led, he said, is not a threat and simply provided security for demonstrations.\n\n“There was never any question of taking power by force of arms,” Mr. Joseph said.\n\nHaiti’s condition could not be more dire. Out of a force of about 15,000 officers, nearly 3,000 police officers have abandoned their posts in the past two years, according to police figures.\n\nThe United Nations reported this week that more than 4,700 people were killed in Haiti last year — more than double the number in 2022 — and nearly 2,500 were kidnapped. A group of local nuns was held for nearly a week, before being released on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 150,000 people fled last year to the United States.\n\nSecurity worsened after the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. It has not been safe enough to hold elections, and the appointed prime minister, Mr. Henry, has called for international intervention.\n\nLast fall, the United Nations approved a multinational security mission to be led by Kenya, but it has been delayed by domestic court rulings. Kenya has pledged at least 1,000 security personnel, and several other nations are expected to offer resources.\n\nThe deployment has been delayed by objections over whether the Kenyan government followed proper protocols to authorize the mission. A court decision is expected on Friday.\n\nMr. Philippe has publicly denounced the Kenya mission, saying it would support Mr. Henry’s administration and support “imperialism.” Mr. Philippe released a video calling the Kenyans “African brothers” but warning that if they accepted the deployment, they would be viewed as “enemies.”\n\nThe B-SAP group is supposed to work to protect environmentally sensitive areas, but it often operates independently and far from such regions, a recent United Nations report said, calling into question the scope of the group’s mission.\n\nIt was started in 2018 under Mr. Moïse with 100 people, though Mr. Henry’s government seems to have little control over its actions or a sense of how many members it has.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Henry fired the man in charge of the agency that runs B-SAP, which angered the group’s members. Videos shared on social media showed hundreds of them chanting in the streets of Ouanaminthe, in northeast Haiti, demanding the return of their boss and the ouster of Mr. Henry.\n\nIn the Northeast, near the border with the Dominican Republic, B-SAP agents fired into the air and ordered citizens to return home.\n\nB-SAP has been accused of participating in crimes, said Gédéon Jean, the head of the Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights, a Haitian organization that suspended operations in November because of rising levels of violence.\n\nThe risk is even more serious if the group allies itself with local gangs, he said.\n\n“What you have is a very disruptive figure in this region,” Robert Muggah, who led a study on Haiti’s criminal syndicates for the United Nations, said, referring to Mr. Philippe.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Mr. Philippe plans to run for office — or to try to lead a revolt, seizing control by mobilizing former military personnel and current and former police officers who support him, Mr. Muggah said.\n\n“I think everybody expects that he has presidential ambitions, but the path to the presidency for him is not yet clear,” he said.\n\nMr. Philippe is operating in a power vacuum where no one has stood up to the prime minister because they are powerless or profiting from the dysfunction, said Nicole Phillips, a California lawyer who is a close follower of Haitian politics and human rights.\n\n“Philippe,” she said, “is all about power.”\n\nMr. Philippe insisted that he would “let the people decide” who should assume Haiti’s presidency. He blamed the United States for backing Mr. Henry and said the goal was to end gangs, hunger and poverty.\n\n“We’re fighting for a better Haiti,” he said. “We’re tired. Everyone is tired.”\n\nAndre Paultre contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.7359724183013474,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Haiti\n*   northern Haiti\n*   Port-au-Prince\n*   U.S. (United States)\n*   southern Haiti\n*   Pestel\n*   Kenya\n*   Ouanaminthe\n*   northeast Haiti\n*   Dominican Republic"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-119.78209686279297}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.863162Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dabrXNN601PIP-J6G2Q8","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":7051},"candidatesTokenCount":69,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":69}],"promptTokenCount":1850,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1850}],"thoughtsTokenCount":964,"totalTokenCount":2883,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.860333+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The defense is arguing that Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, and her office should be disqualified and removed from the prosecution, accusing her of benefiting financially from a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired for the case, Nathan J. Wade.\n\nIf the judge removes them, it would delay and potentially derail a proceeding that has major implications for the 2024 presidential election. Here are takeaways from the second day of the misconduct hearing:\n\nThe ‘star witness’ for the defense shed no new light on the relationship.\n\nDefense lawyers had high hopes for drawing out damaging testimony from Terrence Bradley, a former law partner of Mr. Wade who also served as his divorce lawyer.\n\nBut they were frustrated twice: Mr. Bradley didn’t show up to testify in the morning. Then, once he took the stand in the afternoon, he continued to assert attorney-client privilege over many matters.\n\nThat led to repeated sparring between defense lawyers and the district attorney’s office over what questions he could be asked, and — at points — exasperation from a calm but clearly frustrated presiding judge, Scott McAfee.\n\nA defense lawyer used her own cellphone messages to question the key witness.\n\nAshleigh Merchant, a lawyer for one of Mr. Trump’s co-defendants, took the unusual tactic of referring to text messages from her own cellphone that she had exchanged with Mr. Bradley after learning that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade were dating.\n\nMs. Merchant was hoping to establish that the relationship started before Mr. Wade was hired to manage the Trump prosecution for Ms. Willis, which defense lawyers have asserted would benefit her financially if they were dating and taking expensive trips together.\n\nBut after more than two hours of questioning, Ms. Merchant and her fellow defense lawyers were unable to draw anything out of Mr. Bradley establishing that Mr. Wade was dating Ms. Willis when she hired him.\n\nJudge McAfee did say, however, that he would review two text messages from Mr. Bradley to determine whether they are subject to attorney-client privilege, and thus cannot be disclosed.\n\nThe district attorney did not retake the stand as expected — but her father did.\n\nAfter her heated exchanges with the defense attorneys while testifying on Thursday, Ms. Willis was expected to return to the stand on Friday. But in a surprise move, her office said they did not have additional questions for her.\n\nInstead, Ms. Willis’s father, John Floyd III, testified about the death threats his daughter has faced in recent years, including when people showed up outside her house at 5:30 a.m. one morning yelling the “the b-word” and “the n-word.”\n\nMr. Floyd also backed up Ms. Willis’s testimony that she keeps money in her house, describing it as “a Black thing.” Ms. Willis said Thursday that she had paid back Mr. Wade in cash for the trips they took together.\n\n“I’ve always told my daughter, you keep six months worth of cash, always,” Mr. Floyd said, adding that he gave his daughter her first cash box.\n\nA former governor also testified.\n\nThe district attorney’s office called former Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia, who testified that Ms. Willis had also tried to hire him to manage the Trump case. The prosecution was trying to show that Mr. Wade was not Ms. Willis’s first choice, to establish that she didn’t hire him for personal gain.\n\nMr. Barnes, a prominent Georgia lawyer who represented a Michael Jordan-like figure to the other lawyers in the courtroom, said he turned Ms. Willis down because the money wasn’t good enough, and he didn’t want to deal with hate and vitriol for prosecuting Mr. Trump. “I wasn’t going to live with bodyguards for the rest of my life,” he said.\n\nIt could be a while before the judge rules.\n\nAfter adjourning, Judge McAfee said he would meet in private with Mr. Bradley and his attorney to discuss questions regarding attorney-client privilege and an accusation of sexual assault against Mr. Bradley while he worked with Mr. Wade. Mr. Bradley emphatically denied the allegation, and the judge did not allow further testimony about it from other witnesses.\n\nThe judge said he would then determine a date for lawyers to make their closing arguments on the conflict-of-interest question. It could happen late next week, or the following week, he said, meaning that there will be no quick resolution to the attempt to disqualify the lead prosecutors.\n\nMs. Willis’s office charged Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies in August 2023 with plotting to subvert the 2020 election results.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: What followed was an impassioned monologue by Mr. Johnson in which he explained why continued American aid to Kyiv was, in his view, vital — a message starkly at odds with the hard-right views that have overtaken his party. He invoked his political roots as a Reagan Republican, denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a “madman” and conceded the issue had forced him to walk a “delicate political tightrope.”\n\nReminded by Ms. Colgan, a member of the American Coalition for Ukraine, a nonprofit advocacy group, of the adage that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was for good people to do nothing, Mr. Johnson replied that he kept a copy of the quotation framed in his office.\n\n“That’s not going to be us,” he assured her. “We’re going to do our job.”\n\nThe exchange reflects what Mr. Johnson has privately told donors, foreign leaders and fellow members of Congress in recent weeks, according to extensive notes Ms. Colgan took during the New Jersey event and interviews with several other people who have spoken with him.\n\nWhile the speaker has remained noncommittal about any one option, he has repeatedly expressed a personal desire to send aid to Ukraine — something he has voted against repeatedly in the past — and now appears to be in search of the least politically damaging way to do it.\n\nThe challenge for Mr. Johnson is that any combination of aid measures he puts to a vote will likely infuriate the growing isolationist wing of his party, which considers the issue toxic. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who has repeatedly said she would call a snap vote to unseat the speaker if he allowed a vote for Ukraine aid before imposing restrictive immigration measures, filed a resolution on Friday calling for his removal, saying she wanted to send him “a warning.”\n\nEven if Ms. Greene follows through on the threat, Mr. Johnson could still hold onto his job. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, has said he believed “a reasonable number” of Democrats would vote to save the speaker were he to face a Republican mutiny for acting on the Senate-passed aid package, though on Friday Mr. Jeffries said that had been “an observation, not a declaration.”\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Friday after Ms. Greene had filed her resolution and the House departed Washington for its Easter recess, Mr. Johnson said that when lawmakers returned in two weeks, they would “take the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request.”\n\n“We have done important work discussing options with members,” he said, “and are preparing to complete our plan for action.”\n\nPrivately, Mr. Johnson has expressed an interest in linking Ukraine aid to a measure aimed at forcing the Biden administration to reverse its moratorium on liquefied natural gas exports, according to three people familiar with his deliberations who were not authorized to discuss them. Mr. Johnson pressed the issue at a White House meeting last month with President Biden and congressional leaders, arguing that by prohibiting new exports of domestic energy, the administration was increasing reliance on Russian gas, effectively enriching Ukraine’s enemy.\n\nIn that meeting, according to a person familiar with the comments, Mr. Johnson raised the case of Calcasieu Pass 2, a proposed export terminal that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles, La., and would dwarf the country’s existing export terminals. The Biden administration in January had paused a decision on whether to approve it.\n\nHe has puzzled over whether to put the aid to a vote on the House floor packaged with assistance for other U.S. allies, including Israel and Taiwan, or allow lawmakers to vote on them separately to register their support for each individual nation.\n\nWith many Republicans bent on blocking aid to Ukraine, any legislation carrying it would need to be considered using a special procedure that bypasses House rules and requires a two-thirds majority for passage, relying heavily on votes from Democrats. But a combined aid package for both Ukraine and Israel like the one that passed the Senate last month could be doomed by a coalition of right-wing Republicans opposing the money for Kyiv and left-wing Democrats opposing aid for Israel.\n\nMr. Johnson has pondered imposing new sanctions against Russia. And he has debated how the money should be structured — straight assistance versus a loan — and whether it should be exclusively for lethal aid, a type of assistance that is more widely supported by his conference, or also include nonmilitary assistance.\n\n“There is a big distinction in the minds of a lot of people between lethal aid for Ukraine, and the humanitarian component,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference at the Capitol last week.\n\nBoth he and Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have publicly floated the idea of paying for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen using legislation called the REPO Act.\n\nMr. Johnson has faced mounting international pressure to allow a vote on aid to Ukraine, fielding almost weekly visits and calls from NATO allies and pro-Ukraine activists both at his offices in Washington and Louisiana. When Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland visited Washington earlier this month, he had a sharp public message for the speaker.\n\n“This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,” Mr. Tusk told reporters. “The absence of this positive decision of Mr. Johnson will really cost thousands of lives there — children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.”\n\nMeeting privately with Mr. Johnson in his office in the Capitol, President Andrzej Duda of Poland appealed to the Louisiana Republican’s respect for President Ronald Reagan, whose portrait hung beside the speaker during the meeting. Mr. Duda quoted Mr. Reagan extensively and praised his willingness to call out good versus evil during the Cold War, according to a person familiar with the comments who requested anonymity to describe them.\n\nSome skeptical Ukraine backers, both on and off Capitol Hill, have fretted that Mr. Johnson’s agreeable comments have simply reflected his penchant for telling people what they want to hear. Early in Mr. Johnson’s tenure as speaker, lawmakers noticed that he had a habit of leaving listeners from warring factions with the impression he agreed with each of them.\n\nYet at the fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, he was fairly candid about his calculations.\n\nMr. Johnson told the audience that he was “working to figure out the best route forward,” Ms. Colgan recalled, adding that he said that half of House Republicans wanted to move it together as a package with Israel and Taiwan, and the other half wanted to do it on its own.\n\nAt a separate fund-raiser in Binghamton for a congressman in New York’s Hudson Valley last month, Christina Zawerucha, the executive director of the Together for Ukraine Foundation, and Anatoliy Pradun, the group’s president, who was born and raised in Ukraine, approached the speaker to press him on holding a vote.\n\nMr. Pradun had hoped to appeal to Mr. Johnson’s faith by telling him of the strong evangelical Christian community in Ukraine. But realizing they had little time to make their case, Ms. Zawerucha and Mr. Pradun instead gave the speaker a pin with the Ukrainian and American flags, showed him their poster advertising an upcoming interfaith vigil for Ukraine and implored him to schedule a vote on aid to Kyiv.\n\n“He didn’t turn us away,” Ms. Zawerucha said. “He pointed at our poster and said, ‘I will take care of this.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: For some Ukrainians — officials and citizens alike — the accusations were typical of a Kremlin playbook, blaming Ukraine to justify Moscow’s violence against their country. That includes the false claim that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia used to begin the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, stating that the country was run by neo-Nazi leaders and that the aim of the war was to denazify the country.\n\n“It’s typical for Russia,” Iryna Blakyta, 24, a resident of Kyiv, said on Monday, adding that she expected Mr. Putin to use the attack on the concert hall to rally Russians after more than two years of war. “He needs to mobilize people,” Ms. Blakyta said; “he needs to show who the enemy is.”\n\nBut worries about Mr. Putin’s next steps intensified on Monday morning in Kyiv, which was targeted by two ballistic missiles in broad daylight, the third air assault against the Ukrainian capital in five days. A university building in a central part of the city was reduced to rubble, and officials said at least 10 people had been injured.\n\nThe United States has confirmed the claim of responsibility by ISIS. And, on Monday night, Mr. Putin acknowledged that “radical Islamists” had executed the attack, but he also said Ukraine, backed by the West, could have masterminded the assault. Ukraine denied any involvement.\n\nUkrainian officials said Mr. Putin’s hints that Ukraine was involved were in line with the Kremlin’s longstanding practice of sowing disinformation to cover up the failings of its security services.\n\n“Putin is a pathological liar,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, wrote on X on Sunday, listing a series of bombings, murders and aggressive actions by Russia that he said were all cloaked in lies, including Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and the downing of an airliner over Ukraine by Kremlin-backed fighters the same year.\n\n“Do not let Putin and his henchmen dupe you,” Mr. Kuleba said.\n\nMr. Putin had earlier claimed in a statement about Friday’s attack, which killed at least 139 people, that the suspects “were heading toward Ukraine” after rampaging through the concert hall and that “according to preliminary information, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border.” He stuck to this claim on Monday.\n\nBut Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, ridiculed that claim over the weekend, saying that the Ukrainian-Russian border is an active combat zone that is heavily mined and guarded by both sides — making any crossing extremely complicated and dangerous.\n\n“You don’t need to be a security expert” to understand this, Mr. Yusov said on Ukrainian television on Saturday.\n\nHe and other officials have pointed to Russia’s use of previous terror attacks to pursue political goals, including Mr. Putin using a deadly school siege in 2004 to consolidate political control over the country’s regions, abolishing direct governor elections until their restoration in 2012.\n\nSome Ukrainian officials and analysts have said that Russia’s attempts to shift the blame to Ukraine could be used to lay the groundwork for expanding conscription. Russia has captured several cities and villages in Ukraine in recent months, but at considerable human cost, making it crucial to replenish its forces.\n\n“Their only goal is to motivate more Russians to die in their senseless and criminal war against Ukraine,” Mr. Kuleba said.\n\nMykola Davidiuk, a Ukrainian political analyst, said Mr. Putin wanted to portray Ukraine as “a cruel enemy” linked to terrorism in order to stir up “aggressive attitudes toward Ukraine among Russian people.”\n\nBut he added that Ukrainians “don’t care” about this narrative because they have long been used to the Kremlin’s spurious portrayal of the conflict.\n\nFor now, people in Ukraine were left wondering whether Mr. Putin would use the terrorist attack to justify more deadly strikes against Ukraine. “He needs to constantly create some reasons, to keep things in control,” Ms. Blakyta said.\n\nOn Monday at around 10:30 a.m., residents of Kyiv were startled by a series of loud bangs that came less than a minute after air raid alerts blared across the capital, prompting people to run in the streets to get to shelter.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said it had intercepted two ballistic missiles launched from Crimea, but falling debris destroyed a university gym. “Fortunately, there was nobody inside because it was closed,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko of Kyiv said as he visited the site of the strike.\n\nNearby, investigators were busy collecting and marking missile debris to analyze and determine exactly what kind of weapon was used. Because the missiles streaked into Kyiv quickly after the alarm sounded, there has been speculation that Russia used one of its powerful hypersonic missiles, which fly at several times the speed of sound.\n\nAll that remained of the university building that was hit was a huge pile of bricks, twisted metal structures and broken concrete slabs. Cars nearby were covered in a thick layer of dust, and local people watched as rescuers and firefighters cleared away the rubble, still in shock at what had happened.\n\n“A column of smoke and dust rose, just like in a fog. Then, sirens, rescue vehicles, emergency services,” said Evelina Korzhova, 30, standing in her flower shop, which faced the destroyed building. The shop’s glass window had been shattered by the blast.\n\nIn his evening address on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that over the past week Russia had launched some 190 missiles, 140 attack drones and 700 aerial bombs at Ukraine.\n\nOleksandra Mykolyshyn, Paul Sonne and Daria Mitiuk contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1979811648105054,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1797,"startIndex":1512,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"},{"endIndex":2170,"startIndex":1941,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/ukrainians-dismiss-kremlin-suggestions-their-country-was-behind-moscow-attack.html"},{"endIndex":3025,"startIndex":2749,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"},{"endIndex":3495,"startIndex":3154,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"},{"endIndex":3901,"startIndex":3607,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"},{"endIndex":4264,"startIndex":4022,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/ukrainians-dismiss-kremlin-suggestions-their-country-was-behind-moscow-attack.html"},{"endIndex":4701,"startIndex":4366,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"},{"endIndex":6394,"startIndex":6118,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"},{"endIndex":6713,"startIndex":6487,"uri":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-shun-kremlin-suggestions-country-174020284.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Moscow\n*   Russia\n*   Kyiv\n*   United States\n*   West\n*   Crimea\n*   Ukrainian-Russian border"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-56.30511474609375}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.434310Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"at4daYbBGuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4798},"candidatesTokenCount":47,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":47}],"promptTokenCount":1223,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1223}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1734,"totalTokenCount":3004,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:48.979595+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Marrium Zeshan said leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) staged protests against alleged rigging in the recent elections. She noted rallies were staged in various cities and some of the protesters, including Sardar Latif Khosa and Salman Akram Raja (prominent PTI politicians), were arrested. She mentioned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur (PTI member) addressed a protest rally in Peshawar and demanded that Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) should be given the right to a fair trial and the PTI's \"stolen mandate\" should be returned to it. She added Gandapur also demanded that a commission should be formed to look into the allegations of election rigging.\n\nZeshan questioned whether the arrest of people is justified when peaceful protest is a democratic right. Journalist Salman Ghani said peaceful protests are a right but the opposition has always been facing the same situation in Pakistan. He added protest and resistance politics is effective only for a certain time, and if protests continue for a long time, political workers get tired of them. He was of the view that this protest by the PTI would affect the economy of Pakistan and not the government.\n\nNoting that the PTI could not stage a big show in Punjab, particularly in Lahore, Ghani said the party should review its actions like writing a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) against the release of funds to the government. He reminded the PTI leadership that protests ultimately come to an end through dialogue.\n\nAnalyst Hasan Askari was of the view that matters are not being handled \"democratically\" and said principles of democracy and fundamental rights should be applied across the board. He remarked \"coercive apparatus\" of the state can control the protests for the time being but it would increase hatred. He criticised the government for not focusing on solving the problems of the people. He claimed there is so much despondency among the people that \"80 per cent of the people would leave Pakistan if given an option\".\n\nAnalyst Rasul Bakhsh Rais said the PTI cannot bring about a revolution or topple the government through these protests, nor can it change the election results. He added the party wants to reinforce an impression continuously in the country and abroad that the elections were rigged. Noting that the goal of politics is to resolve disputes, he remarked no political leader in Pakistan is ready to address the cause of political tensions.\n\nJournalist Rasheed Safi said demand for a commission over the election results is a \"realistic demand\" and it would be good if it is accepted. However, he added, it is not likely that the demand would be taken into consideration. He was of the view that Imran Khan is also not likely to be given any relief. He urged the federal government to play its constitutional role in dealing with the provinces and also asked Gandapur to not use his constitutional position to promote his political interests. He warned if tension persists, it would provide an opportunity to anti-state elements to promote hatred in the province [KP], which is already in the \"grip of terrorism\".\n\nGhani disagreed with Askari's view that 80 per cent of the Pakistanis would leave the country if they are given a chance to do so. He said Pakistan did not face such issues till 2017 when it was the \"24th largest economy\". He claimed the economy was derailed by removing former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from power. He agreed that a commission should be formed to look into the allegations of election rigging, along with several other issues. He claimed the PTI's politics of protest is aimed at damaging the country's economy.\n\nZeshan noted prices of essential items have skyrocketed even before the beginning of Ramadan (the month of fasting for Muslims) and asked Ghani what could be the solution to this issue. Ghani replied it is a very sad situation that prices have doubled within two days and would further increase during Ramadan. He said this is a challenge for the new government.\n\nAskari noted the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government cannot control the prices because its main support base is made up of traders and businessmen. He said instead of solving the issue of inflation, the government starts distributing free items. He mentioned political activists get arrested but no shopkeeper is arrested for profiteering because the party gets votes from them.\n\nRais was of the view that the government should bring reforms to manage the supply of food items from farms to common consumers so that it can control hoarding and price hikes.\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1500 GMT 10 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.6758630752563477,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)\n*   Peshawar\n*   Punjab\n*   Lahore"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-67.0345230102539}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.664071Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4daYfEKMK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3955},"candidatesTokenCount":40,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":40}],"promptTokenCount":967,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":967}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1677,"totalTokenCount":2684,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.993835+00:00"}

He said the present government has taken over at a time when Pakistan is facing serious challenges and continues to be in a state of \"economic collapse\". He mentioned the rupee has depreciated massively and there seems no chance of any improvement in the situation. He added the country needs financing of around $30bn and will have to seek funding from friendly countries like China, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.\n\nMalik further said the present government is a \"minority government\" which would be dependent on the support of its coalition partners and would also need backing from the military establishment all the time.\n\nMalik spoke with Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was previously associated with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), and asked him whether the present government would be able to address the problems of the country. Abbasi said he wishes for the government to meet the challenge but it does not seem likely that it would be able to do so. He noted the people in the new cabinet are the same people who were a part of the previous government and they \"do not seem to have the ability to respond to challenges\".\n\nAbbasi emphasised the government will have to go for a \"broader engagement\" politically and talk to all the stakeholders. Replying to a question on whether Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should contact former prime minister Imran Khan, he said Sharif should politically contact everyone, including Khan. He added Sharif should take everyone into confidence about the challenges faced by the country and seek support on the steps taken by the government to address the challenges. He was of the view that the confidence of investors cannot be restored without ending the current political polarisation.\n\nAbbasi noted questions have been raised on the recent elections and Chief Justice Isa should play a role in resolving these issues. He said the Supreme Court has suo moto powers in matters related to elections and it is a serious issue which should be investigated and settled. Speaking about the issue of reserved seats, he said the Sunni Ittehad Council did not present a list of its candidates for the seats reserved for women and minorities, but these seats cannot be distributed to other political parties.\n\nMalik contacted former finance minister Miftah Ismail and asked him whether he agrees with the view that the new cabinet lacks the competence to address the issues faced by Pakistan. Ismail said he is \"glad\" that Muhammad Aurangzeb has been made the Minister of Finance and former finance minister Ishaq Dar has not been given the portfolio again. He was of the view that had it been Dar, an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have been very difficult. He remarked Aurangzeb is a \"very competent\" person.\n\nIsmail noted rest of the cabinet members did not deliver during the previous government, so there is little hope from them that they would perform well now. Speaking about the election results, he alleged Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Salman Akram Raja had won the election but Awn Chaudhry from the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) was declared the winner. He said he refuses to believe that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif really won the election in Lahore.\n\nAbbasi refused to comment on the issue of election results and insisted that the Supreme Court should look into it.\n\nOn Malik's question whether Imran Khan should be released from jail, Ismail said he does not believe that Khan or anyone else should be released because they got votes. However, he added, if the court gives him relief through the process of law, it would be fine. He recalled Khan's government sent many of his political opponents to jail without any reason.\n\nMalik asked Abbasi whether he is planning to form a new political party. Abbasi said he would launch a party because \"all three main political parties [PML-N, PTI and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)] have failed to respond to the real issues of the country\". He was of the view that political parties should focus on national issues instead of levelling allegations on their opponents.\n\nIsmail said he would not join a new party if it approves of dynastic politics and he would want a party which aims to bring improvement to the country and the people.\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 11 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.205399024777296,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   China\n*   United Arab Emirates (UAE)\n*   Saudi Arabia\n*   Lahore\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-49.42136001586914}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.798857Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daYnhMPDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3723},"candidatesTokenCount":41,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":41}],"promptTokenCount":907,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":907}],"thoughtsTokenCount":532,"totalTokenCount":1480,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.098828+00:00"}

So why would he not get into trouble with the authorities? He believed that it would be embarrassing for Australia to accuse of him of spying because he had been an active member of a major political party.\n\nHis confidence was absolute, and utterly misplaced. Less than two years later, in 2020, he became the first person to be charged under Australia’s broad foreign interference laws. He was accused of acting on behalf of Beijing.\n\nWho was the suspect?\n\nDi Sanh “Sunny” Duong, 68, was born and raised in Vietnam. He was among the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Chinese who fled that country in the 1970s. He settled in Australia and grew a business making tombstones, secured a middle-class life and got enmeshed in local Chinese community groups.\n\nI first interviewed him in 2019 and quickly realized that Mr. Duong was prone to boasting — about his travels, about his family and about his status in society, so much so that it was difficult to take him seriously.\n\nWhat did he do?\n\nThe case against Mr. Duong was not about what he did, but what he was planning to do. Mr. Duong had ties with the Chinese Communist Party, prosecutors said. He had invited an Australian government minister to a charity event, they added, with the intention of someday trying to influence him on behalf of Beijing.\n\nDuring the trial, the jury was presented with two versions of Mr. Duong: Was he a savvy operator pushing China’s agenda in Australia, as the prosecution would have it, or was he, as the defense claimed, a bombastic braggart?\n\nWhat was the verdict?\n\nMr. Duong did not testify in court. But while the trial was underway, he met me, at a pub a stone’s throw from the courthouse, to share his story.\n\nHe gave outlandish and convoluted reasons for the actions that prosecutors built their case around. One head-spinning episode involved how Mr. Duong thought he was interacting with a Chinese intelligence officer but later concluded, thanks to a TV show, that the official was not a spy. One thing was clear: Mr. Duong remained adamant that he never did anything against Australian interests.\n\nThe jury disagreed. In December, he was found guilty of preparing for or planning an act of foreign interference. Late last month, a judge sentenced him to two years and nine months in prison. Mr. Duong is expected to serve a year behind bars.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.064258257548014,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":824,"startIndex":615,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/16/was-he-secretly-working-for-china-this-is-what-he-told-us/"},{"endIndex":1550,"startIndex":1318,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/16/was-he-secretly-working-for-china-this-is-what-he-told-us/"},{"endIndex":1811,"startIndex":1597,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/16/was-he-secretly-working-for-china-this-is-what-he-told-us/"},{"endIndex":2704,"startIndex":2475,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/16/was-he-secretly-working-for-china-this-is-what-he-told-us/"},{"endIndex":3525,"startIndex":3230,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/16/was-he-secretly-working-for-china-this-is-what-he-told-us/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"The locations mentioned in the article are:\n\n*   Australia\n*   Beijing\n*   Vietnam\n*   China"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-73.54219818115234}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.048853Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dadX9AvDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2040},"candidatesTokenCount":24,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":24}],"promptTokenCount":553,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":553}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1028,"totalTokenCount":1605,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.991538+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Ms. Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, Ga., can keep control of the state election interference case that has been more than three years in the making, but only if Nathan J. Wade, a former boyfriend, withdraws from the case, which she hired him to manage.\n\nFor much of this year, headlines and hearings delving into the romantic relationship between the two prosecutors have overshadowed the case itself, in which the defendants are charged with conspiring to thwart the will of Georgia voters after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDefense lawyers brought to light the relationship between the prosecutors, saying it had created an untenable conflict of interest. But Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton Superior Court rejected that argument on Friday, while sharply criticizing Ms. Willis for a “tremendous lapse in judgment.”\n\nHere are takeaways from the ruling:\n\nThe judge found an appearance problem, but not an actual conflict.\n\nJudge McAfee said there was not enough proof to find that Ms. Willis’s “personal relationship and recurring travels with her lead prosecutor” created “an actual conflict of interest.”\n\nHe added that “Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices — even repeatedly — and it is the trial court’s duty to confine itself to the relevant issues and applicable law properly brought before it.”\n\nBut the judge did find that “the appearance of impropriety remains” and needs to be remedied. He concluded that “the prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the state selects one of two options.” Either Ms. Willis can step aside, along with her entire office, or Mr. Wade can leave, allowing the case to proceed without further distraction.\n\nHe emphasized that the appearance problem had to be fixed.\n\n“When this danger goes uncorrected, it undermines the legitimacy and moral force of our already weakest branch of government,” he wrote.\n\nThe ruling repeatedly criticized Fani Willis.\n\nThe judge once worked for Ms. Willis in the district attorney’s office, and by all accounts had a positive experience with her as a boss. But in the ruling, he was harshly critical of her conduct, and not just because of the optics of carrying on a relationship with a subordinate on such a high-profile case.\n\nHe also criticized public comments she has made about the case and referred to “the unprofessional manner of the district attorney’s testimony” when she testified at a combative hearing last month.\n\nNoting that neither side offered definitive proof of when the romance began, Judge McAfee wrote that “an odor of mendacity remains” about the matter, as do “reasonable questions” about whether Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade “testified untruthfully about the timing of their relationship.” Both told the judge that it started only after Ms. Willis hired Mr. Wade in November 2021.\n\nNo financial motive was found.\n\nThe judge rejected a key contention of the defense: that Ms. Willis had benefited financially from the case, since her romantic partner was being paid to run it and had paid, at least in part, for vacations they took together.\n\nJudge McAfee noted that Ms. Willis brought charges against far fewer people than a special grand jury had recommended for indictment, undercutting the suggestion that she was trying to inflate legal billings around the case.\n\n“The district attorney has not in any way acted in conformance with the theory that she arranged a financial scheme to enrich herself,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe judge opened the door to a potential gag order.\n\nThe judge appeared to invite the defense to seek a gag order to stop Ms. Willis from publicly discussing the case. He said that Ms. Willis, who is Black, had publicly “cast racial aspersions” on the defense’s decision to bring her relationship with Mr. Wade to light.\n\nHe was referring to a January speech that Ms. Willis made at a local church, when she suggested that the scrutiny of her decision to hire Mr. Wade was racist. The motion alleging a conflict of interest was filed on Jan. 8 by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for Michael Roman, a defendant who is a former Trump campaign operative.\n\nThe judge said the church speech was “too far removed from jury selection to establish a permanent taint of the jury pool,” but expressed concern nonetheless.\n\nHe also referred to what he called Ms. Willis’s “unorthodox decision to make on-the-record comments” to the authors of a recent book, “Find Me the Votes,” by the journalists Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman, noting that she spoke to the authors “during the pendency of this case.”\n\nJudge McAfee wrote that “the time may well have arrived for an order preventing the state from mentioning the case in any public forum to prevent prejudicial pretrial publicity.”\n\nAn appeal seems likely, and a trial distant.\n\nMr. Trump’s lead lawyer in Georgia, Steven H. Sadow, said, “We believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade,” adding that “we will use all legal options available as we continue to fight to end this case, which should never have been brought in the first place.”\n\nThe defense will almost certainly seek to appeal, but the judge has to grant approval for them to do so ahead of a trial.\n\nWhen the case might go to trial remains unclear. Last year, Ms. Willis asked for a trial to start this August, but the judge has yet to set a date. Even with the ruling against disqualification, most legal observers believe a trial is unlikely to start this year.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.074206316912616,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":855,"startIndex":567,"uri":"https://news.nestia.com/detail_share/12335683"},{"endIndex":1247,"startIndex":961,"uri":"https://news.nestia.com/detail_share/12335683"},{"endIndex":1592,"startIndex":1307,"uri":"https://news.nestia.com/detail_share/12335683"},{"endIndex":2699,"startIndex":2491,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":2835,"startIndex":2620,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":3492,"startIndex":3180,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":4109,"startIndex":3738,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":4421,"startIndex":4192,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":4667,"startIndex":4444,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":5213,"startIndex":4949,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":5570,"startIndex":5242,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":6116,"startIndex":5836,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":6724,"startIndex":6419,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"},{"endIndex":7214,"startIndex":6952,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/15/takeaways-from-the-ruling-on-georgia-trump-prosecutors-conduct/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Fulton County\n*   Georgia (also referred to as \"Ga.\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-56.003570556640625}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.689080Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dabiHKsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4637},"candidatesTokenCount":27,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":27}],"promptTokenCount":1156,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1156}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1711,"totalTokenCount":2894,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:52.953377+00:00"}

There is no doubt that he is a banker and a very successful one. It has yet to be seen whether he can be an economist or not. This portfolio will be good for his CV. If he overcomes the crises of economy and climate change, then he will be successful. He has said that Pakistan will seek a long-term and extended programme. Everyone knows that we need to expand our tax base so that we can increase our revenue collection. We have to bring about reforms to our tax system and real estate, retail and agriculture sectors have to pay taxes. We need to build the trust of the people in the government. The government high officials have to give up their perks and privileges.\"\n\nKiani said, \"Zafar Mahmood is the former chairman of WAPDA and this appointment seems to be a violation of the IRSA Act, which was prepared by all the four provinces. This appointment will annoy the provinces. The IRSA chairman has to be a member of IRSA from the province or the federation. I think all four provinces will have reservations on this appointment. This appointment has to be reversed. President Zardari will have to play his leadership role. Now, IRSA will be under the Ministry of Water Resources. This is a dangerous appointment, which may disturb the federation.\"\n\nBaloch said, \"This is an issue of giving IRSA total control of the federal government. No notification of this appointment has been issued by the establishment division. This is a violation of the IRSA Act, which says that the chairman can only be from among the members of IRSA.

Whatever we earn through taxes goes into debt retirement and we take more loans to run the country. Our economy is still in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The standby agreement is ending in March and we will get the last [IMF] tranche. We need continuous support from the IMF. Unfortunately, no political party had provided an economic programme in its election manifesto. We have to see how the new finance minister tackles the economic challenges. Our politics is very polarised. I do not see any disruption to economic activity because of political disputes. The next two to three years will be very difficult for our economy. We need to get an extended programme from the IMF worth $7-8bn. With this, we have to bring reforms to our economy.\"\n\nBaloch said, \"Our economic structure has holes in it and there are dozens of government enterprises in loss. This is bleeding our economy. I think that the only solution is the privatising of these loss-making enterprises. The power [electricity] theft is also alarming. There should be an economic advisory board that should look into the economic quagmire. The members should be independent economists and not government servants. We have to stop the bleeding of our economy. Tax evasion is also a huge problem. Only technical experts can take tough decisions. Our economy has to stand on its own feet and for this we have to be on a treatment table for a long time. The foreign policy of every country reflects its internal strength, both political and economic. The political parties should have a grand dialogue on stabilising our economy and politics.\"\n\nChandio said, \"The finance minister said that he will reduce the interest rate. The IMF wants to increase the tax base. We also need to increase our exports. We can export cotton and other agricultural products. The economy will not improve if we ourselves do not think of out-of-the-box solutions. The PPP wants a public-private partnership whereas I think that the only solution is complete privatisation. The PTI is trying to de-stabilise our economy by writing to the IMF and European Union (EU) not to help Pakistan. It is so unfortunate that no political party has an economic team. The grand political dialogue should also include regional political parties.

During the first phase, over 800 exercise participants were improving military decision-making, as well as command and control and interoperability procedures at unit integration training.\n\nOver the second stage, unit command posts carried out defensive and indirect impact operation planning, interact with the civilian environment and adjacent units, coordinate actions with the superior headquarters, and create tactical operational plans using a tactical command and control information system.\n\nIn the third phase a simulation system is used to put to test operational concepts created by the unit command posts. The simulation system follows the training concept developed by the Control Party to allow creation of a tactical situation for generating events and incidents and adapting to the dynamic and ever-changing situation while executing command and control procedures, taking timely tactical decisions in coordination of actions between units, ensuring uninterrupted execution of operation in coordination with the superior staff and functionality of command posts.\n\nSource: ELTA, Vilnius, in English 0549 gmt 14 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.378190040588379,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":665,"startIndex":307,"uri":"https://www.kariuomene.lt/en/newsevents/lithuanian-land-forces-personnel-train-in-multinational-cpx-in-poland/25814"},{"endIndex":1106,"startIndex":712,"uri":"https://www.kariuomene.lt/en/newsevents/lithuanian-land-forces-personnel-train-in-multinational-cpx-in-poland/25814"},{"endIndex":1533,"startIndex":1306,"uri":"https://www.kariuomene.lt/en/newsevents/lithuanian-land-forces-personnel-train-in-multinational-cpx-in-poland/25814"},{"endIndex":1909,"startIndex":1587,"uri":"https://www.kariuomene.lt/en/newsevents/lithuanian-land-forces-personnel-train-in-multinational-cpx-in-poland/25814"},{"endIndex":2519,"startIndex":1942,"title":"Your prompt"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Poland\n*   Vilnius"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-19.02552032470703}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.238333Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daf3FDqHp1PIPx6PS2AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":1715},"candidatesTokenCount":8,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":8}],"promptTokenCount":376,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":376}],"thoughtsTokenCount":580,"totalTokenCount":964,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.938792+00:00"}

Ishaq replied it is good to see that the PTI has passed through an \"evolutionary process\". Recalling that earlier the PTI had resigned from the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament) and had suffered setbacks due to wrong decisions, she expressed hope about the party learning from its past mistakes. She commented the party again \"committed a blunder\" when it decided to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and could not get a share in the reserved seats for women due to it.\n\nRaza spoke with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Ramesh Singh Arora and asked him how far has Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz's style of politics changed after becoming the chief minister as she was an \"aggressive politician\" earlier. Arora replied there is a \"background\" for Nawaz's aggressive politics as she and her entire family had to face persecution for several years \"from [former president] General Pervez Musharraf's government to [former prime minister] Imran Khan's civilian martial law\". He said through her aggressive politics, Nawaz emerged as the top crowd-puller politician of the country. He added Nawaz now stands for \"performance, delivery, reconciliation and corruption-free Punjab\". He noted in her first speech as the chief minister, Nawaz said she would serve the people of Punjab. He mentioned after being elected as the chief minister, she went to the opposition leader to say that she is not only the chief minister of her government, but also the opposition.\n\nRaza asked senior journalist Saleh Zaafir how President Asif Ali Zardari would leverage his political weight during the next five years. Zaafir said as the president, Zardari has no administrative powers but being a senior politician from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which has its government in Sindh and a coalition government in Balochistan, is his \"strength\".\n\nRaza asked Ishaq about her party's demand that local governments should be empowered. Ishaq said for the MQM, empowerment of local governments is very important, and it had a \"one-point agenda\" during talks for an alliance with the PML-N before elections that three amendments should be brought into the Constitution for this purpose. She added these amendments would be beneficial for the entire Pakistan. She mentioned the MQM has demanded that the office of the mayor should be mentioned in the Constitution like offices of chief ministers and the prime minister, the federal government should transfer funds directly to districts, and elections for the National Assembly and provincial assemblies should not be held before local government elections.\n\nRaza asked Arora whether his party supports empowerment of local governments. Arora replied the PML-N has been a victim regarding local governments as the previous PTI government had sent all the elected local government members in Punjab home immediately after coming into power. He supported the MQM's demands and said all political parties should work jointly for such issues. He further said he is not clear about the party line on direct funding to district governments from the federal government, but in his \"personal opinion\", provinces should distribute funds to the districts.\n\nZaafir claimed political governments in Pakistan have always felt threatened by local governments. He was of the view that it would be better if funds to districts are distributed by the provinces.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 14 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.9049207369486492,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Pakistan\n*   Punjab\n*   Sindh\n*   Balochistan\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-45.71809768676758}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.154864Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4dafC5CbH1x_AP3YWuoAQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3142},"candidatesTokenCount":24,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":24}],"promptTokenCount":744,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":744}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1149,"totalTokenCount":1917,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.957168+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Shahzeb Khanzada said running a coalition government and putting the economy back on track is a major challenge for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He noted questions have been raised about the powers of the finance minister as well as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's decisions and his \"quick U-turn\" on those decisions. He said reportedly differences exist within the PML-N regarding appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as the finance minister. He added when Aurangzeb was appointed as the finance minister, instead of giving him the chairmanship of committees linked to important economic matters, the prime minister decided to keep them with himself or other PML-N senior members. He mentioned after criticism of this decision, chairmanship of one committee was given to the finance minister.\n\nKhanzada spoke with journalist Shehbaz Rana and asked him why there are issues in appointing the heads of committees. Rana said in the decision to appoint Aurangzeb as the finance minister, the prime minister had a major role to play, even more than the military establishment. He noted under former finance minister Ishaq Dar, targets of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme were not achieved and that is why it was continuously being said that Dar would not be made the finance minister again. However, he added, due to pressure from a camp within the PML-N, Dar was given some role in economic management by giving him positions in some of the committees.\n\nRana was of the view that Pakistan needs to provide \"united support\" to the finance minister so that \"hard negotiations\" with the IMF for a new programme can be held.\n\nAlleged division within PTI\n\nKhanzada said elections for 48 seats of the Senate (upper house of the parliament) would be held on 2 April and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has claimed that it would win two seats from Punjab. He added the PTI has alleged that its members in Punjab are being pressurised into changing their party loyalty.\n\nKhanzada asked PML-N politician Rana Sanaullah whether his party is trying to influence PTI members in the Punjab Assembly to form a \"forward bloc\". Sanaullah said the PTI has got \"strange kind of people elected to the assemblies\" who are destroying the party. He referred to a statement by PTI politician Sher Afzal Marwat, who claimed 40 members of the PTI parliamentary party in the Punjab Assembly have changed their party loyalty, and commented it is not easy to influence 40 members to change their political affiliation and no one is trying to win over their loyalties.\n\nSanaullah said Aurangzeb's appointment as the finance minister was a decision by the prime minister and noted that it has helped the government successfully complete talks with the IMF for the last tranche of the standby programme. He remarked since this is a coalition government, the PML-N has to accept certain \"compromises\". He commented the PML-N is not desperate to remain in power, but is \"desperate to make this government successful\". He mentioned he was not in favour of the PML-N forming a government in the centre but the party took the final decision of making its government. He added Shehbaz Sharif has accommodated demands of all the parties in the coalition.\n\nScandal surrounding new federal minister\n\nKhanzada reported on a recent scandal regarding \"misuse of political authority\", involving newly appointed federal minister Ahad Cheema and Punjab Governor Baligh ur Rehman, due to which principal of the prestigious Aitchison College of Lahore had to resign. He said Cheema and Rehman changed a policy of the college to benefit the former's children. He spoke with Cheema and sought an explanation from him. Cheema claimed the policy was changed by Rehman for the benefit of all the students, and not just his children.\n\nCipher case\n\nKhanzada reported on a hearing of former prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign affairs minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's appeal in the Islamabad High Court against their conviction in the cipher case. He cited remarks of the judges and arguments of the counsels. He mentioned the hearing has been adjourned till 26 March.\n\nSource: Geo News, Karachi, in Urdu 1700 GMT 25 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.032063603401184,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Punjab\n*   Lahore\n*   Islamabad\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-33.02603530883789}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.539599Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dac_3IPDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3548},"candidatesTokenCount":32,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":32}],"promptTokenCount":879,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":879}],"thoughtsTokenCount":487,"totalTokenCount":1398,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.43381+00:00"}

Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and the IMF's mission chief to Pakistan, Nathan Porter, led their teams during the talks, which began on Thursday last week.\n\nPakistan signed the latest short-term agreement last year to overcome one of the worst economic crises in its history that had raised fears the South Asian Islamic nation could default on the payment of foreign debts. The $3 billion bailout was signed by Sharif, who replaced former Premier Imran Khan after a no-confidence vote in parliament.\n\nSharif was again elected the country’s premier this month following Feb. 8 parliamentary elections.\n\nThe latest development came weeks after Khan wrote a letter to the IMF urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of the recent elections, which his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party says were rigged. Authorities have dismissed the charge as baseless.\n\nPakistani authorities have criticized Khan for writing the letter, saying it was a bid to harm the country's already ailing economy. Pakistan narrowly averted a default on foreign payments last summer.\n\nIn its statement on Wednesday, the IMF said “Pakistan’s economic and financial position has improved\" in recent months. However, it noted the “growth is expected to be modest this year and inflation remains well above target, and ongoing policy and reform efforts are required to address Pakistan’s deep-seated economic vulnerabilities amidst the ongoing challenges posed by elevated external and domestic financing needs and an unsettled external environment.\"\n\nThe IMF said Sharif's government is committed to continue the policy efforts that started under the current bailout “to entrench economic and financial stability for the remainder of this year.\"\n\nIt said Pakistani authorities are determined to take steps to further improve the country's economy by broadening the tax base, and through the timely implementation of power and gas tariff adjustments, while protecting the vulnerable through existing progressive tariff structures.\n\nThe IMF said Pakistan has also expressed interest in receiving a new bailout.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The answer, after a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday, seemed to be that he was both.\n\nMr. Zelinger, 45, pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering, admitting that he had helped run an illegal gambling club and had threatened debtors to make them pay.\n\nWhen he was arrested in Switzerland in 2022, prosecutors said that he had led a ruthless crew linked to an Eastern European mafia group known as Thieves in Law that wreaked havoc in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brighton Beach, Sheepshead Bay and Coney Island.\n\nThe slew of charges against him included directing a May 2016 arson in a residential building on Voorhies Avenue where a high-stakes poker game was being held. The blaze nearly killed two teenagers and left a firefighter with career-ending injuries, prosecutors said.\n\nThe game competed with his own illegal gambling spot on Coney Island Avenue, where players were plied with free alcohol, cocaine and massages, according to court documents. Months later, as investigators closed in, Mr. Zelinger left the country permanently.\n\nA grand jury indictment unsealed that October included charges against Mr. Zelinger and eight others; two other defendants were later added to the case. All were convicted or pleaded guilty to racketeering and related charges.\n\nBut Mr. Zelinger’s lawyer, Susan Kellman, painted a dramatically different story of his life, arguing that he was a dedicated father whose life had been upended by illness and war.\n\nIn a motion filed last year, she wrote that after moving back to his native Ukraine in 2016, he had married a woman who was diagnosed with a brain tumor after giving birth to the last of their three children.\n\nWhen war broke out, it became impossible to find treatment, and she died from her illness, Ms. Kellman wrote. Mr. Zelinger was then displaced by fighting along with his children, then ages 6, 4 and 2. The family lived in their car and traveled by night to avoid the fighting, finally escaping to Slovenia before making their way to Switzerland, she wrote.\n\n“If he’s the boss or he has links to the Eastern European mafia, whatever that is, it would have seemed to me he would have had a much easier time when he was overseas fighting for his life and his family’s life,” Ms. Kellman said at a hearing last year.\n\n“But there was nobody there to help him.”\n\nOnce they were settled in Switzerland, Mr. Zelinger received a phone call telling him to report to a local police station to enroll the children in school, according to his account. But it was a trap. When he arrived, he was arrested, and the children were put in an orphanage. But “miraculously,” in Ms. Kellman’s words, they were rescued by the chief rabbi of Zurich, who arranged for them to be sent to live with their grandmother in Brooklyn.\n\nMr. Zelinger’s family was not present at the hearing on Thursday, which lasted 90 minutes as Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon parsed the complicated plea agreement. Mr. Zelinger pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering but admitted to a role in other crimes, allowing those to be factored into the judge’s decision on sentencing. He wore prison khakis and a dark, close-cropped beard at the hearing and was aided by a Russian interpreter.\n\nThe maximum penalty on the charges under federal sentencing guidelines would be 20 years. But the prosecutor in the case, Victor Zapana of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, said on Thursday that he and the defense had agreed to recommend a sentence of five to six years. That hearing is scheduled for July 18 before Judge Brian M.

Part of his Objects of Desires series, the six designs include trompe l’oeil columns, wing-footed mythological figures and interlinked geometric shapes. Erdei found inspiration for his pieces, which are over seven feet tall, in a recent retrospective of the Italian couturier Elsa Schiaparelli’s works at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs and in the lacquered screens of multimedia Art Deco creator Jean Dunand; Pompeii’s crumbling frescoes and ancient mosaics informed the mythological design’s soft, ocher hues, which were achieved through multiple coats of acrylic paint. “I keep coming back to Pompeii in my work,” Erdei says. “I find the layers faded by time so beautiful, like veils of history.”\n\nThought to have originated during China’s Han dynasty, screens became popular decorative pieces in Europe in the 17th century, when they were used for privacy and to divide rooms and block drafts. A couple of centuries later, Coco Chanel lined her Paris apartment with black-and-gold lacquer Coromandel screens. Erdei, who once worked as a women’s wear designer at Gucci in Rome, also wants his screens to stand out. “I see them used as a theatrical background behind a bed or a sofa, or either side of a fireplace,” he says. A bespoke screen will also make an appearance, alongside his signature acrylic murals, in his next project, the interior design of a private riad turned hotel called Le M, opening in Marrakech’s medina this summer.

Occupying what was previously an American bar-nightclub in the Opera district, the restaurant combines the brasserie format — broad and bustling dining rooms with deep booths — and the relaxed spirit of a British pub. Franklin wanted the menu to be an approachable mix featuring a selection of his signature pies (among them beef and bone marrow; Montgomery Cheddar, dauphinoise potato and caramelized onion; chicken and wild mushroom; and lobster for two) alongside pub classics like Scotch eggs, sausage rolls and sticky toffee pudding. “If we’re introducing Parisians to old-school British pies that are inspired by 600-year-old recipes and history, we have to do it gradually,” says Franklin. For the interiors, the architect and designer Laura Gonzalez wove in hand-finished oak furnishings, tartan fabrics that vary on each of the three floors and a patchwork of bright tiles. On the lower level, there’s a bar with its own entrance, while on the top floor, diners can sit in a spacious winter garden and play a round of darts or chess in the game room. It all makes for something fresh for Paris and an adventure for Franklin. “When I was young, a lot of my chef friends came to work in Paris but I was too shy; I didn’t speak French and it was all too easy to stay in London,” he says. “I’ve always regretted it because I saw how Paris changed them. Now, it’s my turn.” Public House opens March 26, publichouseparis.fr.\n\nA Cookbook — and Seder Plates — to Celebrate Passover\n\nPassover, the Jewish holiday that marks the Exodus from Egypt, is built around a meal — the Seder — and the story of the flight to the Promised Land that’s told with it. On the same night, everywhere in the world where there are Jews, the ritual meal takes place, though the food and flavors differ according to the local culture. “The Jewish Holiday Table,” a new collection of recipes curated by the Jewish Food Society, covers all the Jewish holidays and Shabbat, the Friday night Sabbath dinner. The recipes — and family histories — come from cooks with roots in Iran, India, Iraq and Israel, Morocco, Hungary, Denmark and the former Soviet Union. Many of the contributors’ families settled in New York, among them the Ethiopian-born chef Beejhy Barhany, who owns Harlem’s Tsion Café and contributed Shabbat dishes from her family village in Tigray. These include dabo, an Ethiopian honey bread, and messer wot, a red lentil stew. Fany Gerson, whose family migrated from Ukraine to Mexico City, where she was born, and who now makes doughnuts at her bakery Fan Fan in Brooklyn, spices up her Passover Seder, adding chiles and cilantro to the matzo ball soup and spicy tomato sauce to the gefilte fish. Her brisket is cooked in tamales. Serve the food you end up making on a Seder plate from Hayom, a Brooklyn-based company that collaborates with artists on Judaica. The conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas has created a plate featuring a photograph of “Reach” (2023), his work with the artist Coby Kennedy that’s on display at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, while the ceramist Frankie Aziz has designed one with her signature cobalt drawings.\n\nA Cafe and Art Space in a Former Berlin Amusement Park\n\nFor more than two decades, the amusement park Spreepark, located along Berlin’s River Spree, was left abandoned. Its retro rides were engulfed by grass and vines, and its owner was eventually jailed for drug smuggling. In 2014, Spreepark was bought by the city of Berlin and handed over to the state-owned park management company Grün Berlin with the remit that they enliven it with culture and food. Now, the first project within the revitalized complex is open and ready for visitors: The Eierhäuschen, a recently renovated 19th-century building just outside the amusement park, contains Ei 12437, a cafe run by the restaurateur Jessica-Joyce Sidon and the chef Alexandra Strödel that began service in February, as well as the multidisciplinary Spreepark Art Space, which opens on Friday. (Its inaugural exhibition is a group show of artists — Marcus Maeder, Sabine Scho, Sissel Tolaas and Annett Zinsmeister — who were asked to research the park and present their findings.) For lunch, the beer garden serves elevated German pub dishes such as a hearty potato salad, pretzels and pickled herring and onion sandwiches. In the evenings it gets a bit more formal, with a small but sophisticated menu served in a dining room featuring parquet floors and carmine walls. The latest seasonal dishes include an Onsen tamago-style egg served with potato foam, and cabbage stuffed with Jerusalem artichoke and hazelnuts. ei-12437.berlin.\n\nDecadent Home Textiles From the Fashion Designer Giles Deacon\n\nSanderson, the British company that’s been producing wallpaper since the Victorian era, draws upon a deep well of design legacy with each new collection they release — and their latest collaboration, with the London-based fashion designer Giles Deacon, is no different. Deacon looked to Sanderson’s archive of British countryside florals and added his own flourishes to fabrics and wall coverings in a soothing palette of pastels and pale earth tones. Faraday velvet takes the humble concept of chicken wire and transforms it into a twisting pattern that would feel at home within the walls of an elegant estate. Andromeda’s Cup turns its titular subject into a wallpaper motif framed by acanthus leaves and sweeping drapery. Perhaps fittingly for a couturier, many of Deacon’s prints have a handcrafted look — the Aperignon Parade wallpaper features saw-toothed stripes that appear to have been freshly made with pinking shears, while artfully rumpled bows and Deacon’s own calligraphy add an unexpected element of whimsy to the botanical Cupid’s Beau print. The designer wanted the collection to be “surprising yet classic,” he says, “always tethered to an unwavering sense of Britishness.” From $196 per wallpaper roll and $220 per fabric yard, sanderson.sandersondesigngroup.com.\n\nA Healthy Dose of Color Renews a Hotel on the Finnish Coast\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Finnish architects Alvar and Aino Aalto completed Paimio Sanatorium, a modernist masterpiece dedicated to the treatment of tuberculosis. At Paimio, patients could recover in rooms with mint-green ceilings, take fresh air on curved balconies and walk banana-yellow stairs leading to bright communal areas. The idea of a building that might influence human well-being resonated with Aino Brandt, a founding partner and interior architect at the Helsinki-based design firm KOKO3. Tasked with renovating Original Sokos Hotel Royal in Vaasa, a maritime city said to be Finland’s sunniest, Brandt drew on the Aaltos’ “ingenious use of bold colors,” she says. The two-story lobby of the hotel’s 1980s tower — which reopened last month and now holds a lively multi-panel commissioned work by the Finnish artist Jenni Rope — is the nexus around which the hotel’s social spaces, including a cinema, a rooftop pool area with no less than three saunas, and a trio of restaurants, are organized. Above dining tables, lamps by Muller Van Severen for Valerie Objects reference the Aaltos’ preference for functional, indirect lighting. In the hotel’s 139 bedrooms (121 more rooms will be added once the second part of the hotel opens across the street in 2026), shades of yellow, deep orange and blue feature on walls, while textile patterns designed by KOKO3 and manufactured by the Finnish weaving mill Annala make carpets and cushions pop.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The incendiary law grants Indian citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsees and Christians from a few nearby countries. Muslims are pointedly excluded.\n\nWith a characteristic thunderclap, the government of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, made a short declaration on Monday night that it had finalized the details that would bring the law, known as the Citizenship Amendment Act, into force.\n\nThe government’s action, coming just before India announces the dates for an election expected in April and May, shows Mr. Modi delivering on a promise, and could change the electoral math in districts with Hindu refugees who stand to benefit from the law.\n\nPolitics aside, the law is not expected to significantly change the demography of India’s diverse population of 1.4 billion, at least not on its own. But it makes plain the power that Mr. Modi wields to redefine the Indian republic, steamrolling any resistance to his vision of a Hindu-first state.\n\nThe law spent more than four years in hibernation after protests by hundreds of thousands of Muslims and other Indians who were outraged by the idea that citizenship would be defined with reference to religious identity.\n\nIn February 2020, while President Donald J. Trump was on a state visit, riots broke out in the capital, New Delhi. Whole neighborhoods were devastated in the northeastern part of the city, where gas cylinders were turned into makeshift bombs and tossed into mosques. At least 50 people were killed, most of them Muslims.\n\nA high-profile protest camp at a place called Shaheen Bagh, operated mainly by female protesters from different religious groups, carried on until late March before being dispersed. And then Covid-19 intervened, helping to suppress further protest.\n\nThe government justified the new rules as a humanitarian response to the plight of minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, India’s three big Muslim-majority neighbors. Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk turned political ally of Mr. Modi, wrote on social media that rescuing communities “who are suffering from religious brutality” would bring “joy to humanity.”\n\nIt is hard for many to take this explanation at face value. For one thing, the inclusion of some countries and exclusion of others looks arbitrary. For another, Muslims persecuted because of their faith, for instance the Ahmadiyya and Shiites of Pakistan, do not make the cut for Indian citizenship. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called the law “fundamentally discriminatory.”\n\nTo critics, the Citizenship Amendment Act looks like one part of a pincer movement against Muslims. It was brought to life at the same time as a national citizenship registry that would allow the government to expel undocumented residents, even if their families had lived in India for generations.\n\nAs Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, Amit Shah, said at the time, “Please understand the ‘chronology’: first the C.A.A.,” and then the registry. In other words, first non-Muslim refugees would be allowed citizenship. Then the refugees who remained would be expelled. More than 1,000 “declared foreigners” have been detained in the northeastern state of Assam.\n\nOn Monday, protests erupted there and in several other states after the government announced enforcement of the citizenship law. Shaheen Ahmed, a doctoral student in Kerala, said that he and other students came out to protest across his state.\n\n“We were demanding the rollback of the law when police came and started beating us,” Mr. Ahmed said.\n\nOne group that rejoiced at the news is a large community of lower-caste Hindus in West Bengal, whose ancestors came to India from Bangladesh. Their support for Mr. Modi in the upcoming election could tip several parliamentary seats into the majority that he is expected to achieve anyway.\n\nOther Hindu refugees, from Pakistan, had already been acquiring citizenship. More than 1,100 have been granted that status in Mr. Modi’s home state, Gujarat, since 2016. The point of the Citizenship Amendment Act will be to make these naturalizations possible on a national level, and more visible.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.178193692807798,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   India\n*   New Delhi\n*   Shaheen Bagh\n*   Pakistan\n*   Bangladesh\n*   Afghanistan\n*   Assam\n*   Kerala\n*   West Bengal\n*   Gujarat"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-63.622459411621094}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.057439Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dad_AA53y1PIPxO6p0Qc","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3514},"candidatesTokenCount":54,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":54}],"promptTokenCount":861,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":861}],"thoughtsTokenCount":836,"totalTokenCount":1751,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.116211+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: But after making rapid gains in the subsequent days, Russian assaults have stalled around three contested nearby villages. Military experts cite several factors, including terrain that does not favor offensive operations, Russian troops exhausted by months of fighting and a Ukrainian army that has committed significant forces to defending the area.\n\nRussia seems to be maintaining its initiative on the battlefield, and military analysts say its forces could still break through Ukrainian lines in the near future, especially since Kyiv’s defensive efforts are increasingly curtailed by the absence of further American military aid.\n\nYet for now, they say the fighting appears to have reverted to the kind of inconclusive back-and-forth battles that have characterized much of the war’s front line combat this past year.\n\n“The capture of Avdiivka has not led to the collapse of Ukrainian lines, the possibility for the Russians to move onto open ground or even to make major gains,” said Thibault Fouillet, the deputy director of the Institute for Strategic and Defense Studies, a French research center. “There’s no decisive action or breakthrough.”\n\nIt’s a contrast to the situation that emerged from the fall of Avdiivka in mid-February. At that time, as Ukraine’s forces retreated, Russia advanced rapidly, aided in part by the absence of strong Ukrainian defensive positions. Russian troops captured three settlements and took control of nine square miles of land, according to open-source maps of the battlefield.\n\nBut in the past 10 days, Moscow has captured only a little over a square mile of land, according to the open-source maps. Its soldiers have been caught up in fighting in and around the villages of Berdychi, Orlivka and Tonenke.\n\nRussian forces “seem to be attempting to push forward using small infantry assault groups, but are being decimated in the relatively open terrain west of Avdiivka,” said Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, a Finland-based open-source community that assesses satellite imagery and social media content from the battlefield.\n\nThe recent fighting has also come at a cost to the Ukrainian army, which appears to have now committed some of its best troops and weapons to the fight in the area west of Avdiivka.\n\nIts 47th Brigade, which the United States trained and equipped last year, has been defending Berdychi. A video released by Ukraine’s defense ministry purported to show the brigade using an American-made Abrams tank, one of the United States’ most advanced.\n\nThe Ukrainian army “is allocating all possible weapons” to the fight outside Avdiivka, said Serhii Kuzan, the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a nongovernmental research group.\n\nBut three of Ukraine’s Abrams tanks have been destroyed or damaged and abandoned there in the past two weeks, according to Oryx, a military analysis website that counts losses based on visual evidence.\n\nUkrainian forces also suffered heavy losses as they fought off Russian assaults on Avdiivka for months.\n\nMilitary experts say that Ukraine’s continued defense in the area is likely intended to give its units time to prepare and reinforce new defensive lines further west. The Ukrainian army recently published photos of fortifications that it said it was building near the Avdiivka battle zone, including 6.5-foot-deep trenches and anti-tank ditches.\n\n“You’ve got a stronghold that’s fallen,” Mr. Fouillet said, referring to Avdiivka, “so you need time to put a defensive line back in place.”\n\nRussia’s assault on Avdiivka resulted in heavy human and material losses for its forces. British military intelligence said that the average daily number of Russian troops killed and wounded in February, when Moscow was devoting a large number of forces to the fight for Avdiivka, had reached 983, “the highest rate since the start of the war.”\n\nMr. Paroinen and Mr. Kuzan noted that Ukraine’s forces have benefited from the area’s terrain. While Russian troops have been attacking Berdychi, Orlivka and Tonenke through open fields with little cover, Ukrainian units hold the high ground in the villages, making it easier to target approaching Russian soldiers.\n\nShould Russian troops eventually capture the three villages, it is unclear what their exact next steps would be, given that the terrain is hilly and dotted with streams and reservoirs, complicating further advances.\n\nMr. Kuzan said that Russia’s army was currently attacking multiple places all along the more than 600-mile front line to probe Ukraine’s defenses.\n\n“Which of them will be prioritized, for example, in two days or next week, will depend on how well they succeed in pushing through our defense,” he said. “Where they succeed in pushing through, they will deploy additional reserves to build on their success.

Austin III, in Germany for the start of a meeting of about 50 governments that are supplying Kyiv’s forces, said that allies would “dig deeper to get vital security assistance to Ukraine.”\n\nTo that end, Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said Berlin would send Ukraine 10,000 rounds of badly needed artillery shells, 100 armored infantry vehicles and transport equipment in a new $544 million infusion of support. The Finnish defense chief, Antti Häkkänen, announced a $32 million donation to help the Czech Republic buy 800,000 rounds of ammunition, including from beyond NATO-member militaries and manufacturers.\n\nAnd Mr. Austin highlighted the new $300 million package of attack and air defense missiles, artillery rounds and armor systems that the United States pledged for Ukraine last week.\n\nYet Ukrainian forces could burn through much of the new aid within months, if not weeks. It is unlikely that the Biden administration will be able to send much more unless Republicans in the House of Representatives unlock a $60 billion emergency spending plan for additional weapons for Ukraine and to bolster armament production in the United States.\n\n“We will have to deal with it, and we will deal with it,” Mr. Pistorius said on the sidelines of the meeting, held at Ramstein Air Base, an American military hub in Germany, when asked about the blocked funding in Washington.\n\nHe said Germany was prepared to continue supporting Ukraine, and “I’m sure and I’m convinced the United States will, like it used to do before, too.”\n\nMr. Austin declared at the meeting’s start that “Ukraine’s battle remains one of the great causes of our time.” Later, he cast the war as “crucial to our own security” in remarks that seemed directed more toward critics in Congress than to the journalists before him in Germany.\n\n“The United States would face grave new perils in a world where aggression and autocracy are on the march, and where tyrants are emboldened, and where dictators think that they can wipe democracy off the map,” Mr. Austin said.\n\n“Today, Ukraine’s survival is in danger and America’s security is at risk,” he said. “They don’t have a day to waste, and we don’t have a day to spare either.”\n\nWhile the United States remains the single largest donor of military support to Ukraine, Mr. Austin praised recent donations of weapons by Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden. He also noted the Czech campaign to scrounge the world for artillery shells, the first tranche of which could arrive on the battlefield within weeks.\n\nUkraine’s soldiers are already running out of many munitions: A shortage of artillery shells helped force a retreat in the eastern city of Avdiivka, and air defense missiles have been rationed around the highest-priority cities and infrastructure to protect against Russian strikes.\n\nOn Monday, after meeting Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine ticked off a list of missiles, fighter jets and shells that he said were urgently needed on front lines.\n\nIn his own summary of the Monday meeting in Kyiv, Mr. Graham predicted that at least some American assistance to Ukraine would arrive as loans, as former President Donald J. Trump has urged, instead of donated outright.\n\n“I know Americans want to help our friends and allies, but I also believe we must consider our economic situation as we help others,” Mr. Graham said in a statement. He said he would also demand that the Biden administration send longer-range missiles to Ukraine, enabling its forces to strike Russian-held territory, and speed training for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 warplanes.\n\nThe uncertainty over the American commitment to Ukraine has largely left European allies to try to fill the gap, but producers of key weapon systems and artillery ammunition have struggled to ramp up and are unable to keep pace with the demand.\n\nSome European leaders — especially in the Baltics, Nordic countries and nations that border Ukraine — have also raised alarms about the specter of Russia’s invading NATO territory should it win the current conflict.\n\nMr. Austin echoed those concerns ahead of the meeting at Ramstein, where he sat next to Ukraine’s defense minister, Rustem Umerov. It was Mr. Austin’s first in-person return to the group since two hospitalizations this year, including a dayslong stint in January related to complications from prostate cancer surgery that he did not disclose to the White House, prompting criticism.\n\n“Let’s not kid ourselves: Putin will not stop at Ukraine,” Mr. Austin said. “But as President Biden has said, Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself.”\n\nEric Schmitt and Christopher F.

He noted Pakistan now has a new government and a new economic team under Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb will be holding talks with the IMF delegation. He added after this review, Pakistan will have to go into another IMF programme.\n\nRaza spoke with Dr Khaqan Hassan Najeeb, an expert on economic affairs, and asked him for his views on the prospect of talks with the IMF. Najeeb said he has constantly been saying that leaving the IMF would be an action that would put Pakistan in \"more discomfort\" and it is good that the new government has realised this. He noted the standby agreement is an \"interim arrangement\" that enables Pakistan to acquire bilateral, multilateral and commercial funds. He mentioned the country would be going into the 24th IMF programme but 21 of those programmes have remained incomplete.\n\nNajeeb remarked it is not an IMF programme but \"Pakistan's programme which is being financed by a lender [IMF]\". He noted Pakistan got IMF funding in the past for some \"breathing room\" but did not implement \"deeper reforms\" due to which the economy could not stabilise.\n\nRaza spoke with Dr Shimail Daud, former president of the Rawalpindi Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and asked him why the country's economic challenges have grown after 2018. Daud replied continuity of policy was not maintained due to the changing governments. He said governments avoided taking tough decisions to implement reforms because it led to a \"political fallout\". He added those governments tried making \"populist decisions\" and giving excessive subsidies. He was of the view that such wrong actions were continuously \"stacked\" and problems kept growing.\n\nDaud commented the IMF tries to \"discipline\" the economy, but as soon as the government gives up that discipline, it loses the steps forward. He added that is why issues in the economy have remained unresolved, like loss-making enterprises not being privatised, circular debt increasing and tax to gross domestic product ratio continuing to be low. He was of the view that the leadership should take people into confidence that tough measures are not wrong decisions but necessary corrective steps. He insisted \"belt-tightening\" is needed in the coming years.\n\nSuggesting some reforms to improve the economy, Najeeb said Pakistan needs to reduce the size of the federal government to control its expenditures. He added the country needs to stop unnecessary subsidies and pensions should not be state-funded.\n\nRaza contacted Haroon Sharif, former chairperson of the Board of Investment, and asked him whether pending mega projects like the oil refinery by Saudi Arabia, revival of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (mega development project), and the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline could materialise now since an elected government with a \"clear-cut agenda\" is in place. Sharif replied these projects have remained pending for several years and that is because \"macro-economic vulnerabilities\" of governments impacted the flow of foreign investment. He noted Pakistan's risk on external payments has remained high. He was of the view that the government should facilitate \"relatively smaller investment deals for the private sector\" besides focusing on the mega projects. He emphasised Pakistan needs to reduce the cost of doing business and increase the ease of doing business.\n\nUpcoming elections in India\n\nTalking about the upcoming Indian elections, Raza said it looks like the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to win elections with an \"anti-Muslim\" and \"nationalist Hindu\" sentiment. He asked political analyst Raza Muhammad Khan to share his views on the BJP's election campaign which isolates a large part of the population, which is non-Hindu, from the system. Khan replied the BJP's election formula is a \"tested one\" as it has helped the party win elections twice but it is also a \"very dangerous formula\".\n\nKhan claimed the economy or good governance have no role in the BJP's election campaign and it aims to \"divide people on the basis of religion, hatred towards Muslims in India and Kashmir, and hatred against Pakistan\". He added it degrades other minorities like the Sikhs and Dalits. He remarked it looks like the BJP is not bothered about alienating a large population of Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs and others.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 13 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9100267161493716,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Rawalpindi\n*   Saudi Arabia\n*   China\n*   Iran\n*   India\n*   Kashmir\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-41.861228942871094}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.232105Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daamVDsCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3896},"candidatesTokenCount":46,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":46}],"promptTokenCount":948,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":948}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1508,"totalTokenCount":2502,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.813014+00:00"}

Here are takeaways from the combative hearing:\n\nDefense lawyers focused on spending by the couple.\n\nIn some of the sharpest questioning of the day, defense lawyers pressed Mr. Wade on his finances, attempting to raise doubt about his assertions that Ms. Willis had repaid him with cash for her share of expensive trips while they were dating, including to Belize, Aruba, Tennessee and California.\n\nMr. Wade called Ms. Willis an “independent strong woman” who insisted that “she is going to pay her own way.” Regarding a trip to California, he said, “everything we did when we got into Napa, she paid for.” But Mr. Wade also said she typically reimbursed him in cash, so there were no receipts available.\n\nMs. Willis forcefully rebutted suggestions that she had not paid her share of the trips, saying that she keeps thousands of dollars in cash secured at her home. “For many many years, I’ve kept money in my house,” she said.\n\nA former friend challenged the timeline of the relationship.\n\nDefense attorneys have said that the relationship between the two prosecutors started before Mr. Wade was hired in November 2021. Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade have disputed that, saying the relationship started in early 2022.\n\nTheir timeline was disputed Thursday by testimony from a former friend of Ms. Willis, Robin Bryant-Yeartie, who said she had “no doubt” that the two had started a romantic relationship earlier than they have claimed.\n\nBut Mr. Wade, who testified for several hours, stood firm in the assertion that the relationship began only after he was hired. He also revealed that it had ended in summer 2023.\n\nFani Willis pushed back hard at the defense lawyers.\n\nThe sparring between Ms. Willis and the defense lawyers grew so tense at various points that the presiding judge, Scott McAfee, warned the parties several times to limit their answers in order to preserve decorum.\n\nMs. Willis angrily accused defense lawyers of spreading lies about her and Mr. Wade.\n\n“I’m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told a defense attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, at one point. It is the defendants, she said, who are on trial for trying to steal an election.\n\nA disqualification would be a major roadblock in the Trump prosecution.\n\nIf Judge McAfee determines that Ms. Willis has a conflict of interest, and that it merits disqualification, the case would then be reassigned to another Georgia prosecutor, who would have the ability to continue with the case exactly as it is, make major changes — such as adding or dropping charges or defendants — or to even drop the case altogether.\n\nIt would be up to a state entity called the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia to find someone else to take up the case. The council’s executive director, Pete Skandalakis, has been criticized for moving slowly in the effort to find a prosecutor to consider whether Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, should also face charges related to the Trump case.\n\nBut the case against Mr. Trump and the other defendants is a different circumstance, since a grand jury has already handed down charges. Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies were charged last August with racketeering in connection with a plot to subvert the 2020 presidential election results.

The strike, which couldn't be independently verified, killed seven members of the Russian crew and injured six others, while 52 were rescued, the agency said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry didn’t comment on the claim, but some Russian military bloggers confirmed the ship's loss and said its crew had been rescued.\n\nThe strike, if verified, would mark the latest successful use of Ukraine's domestically produced Magura drones, the agile uncrewed boats that have become the Russian navy's nemesis. Just last month, drones sank Russia's Caesar Kunikov amphibious landing ship and Ivanovets missile corvette. The Russian military hasn’t acknowledged those losses, either, but they have been reported by Russian military bloggers and some media.\n\nIn another attack in late December, Ukraine said it destroyed the Novocherkassk landing vessel in Crimea’s port of Feodosia with long-range cruise missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry said the ship was damaged in the attack, but Russian war bloggers said it was lost.\n\nThe Ukrainian military also has launched a series of persistent cruise missile and drone strikes on Russian radar facilities, air defense assets and air bases in Crimea, a region of Ukraine that Russia annexed in 2014. Increasing the pain for Moscow, Ukrainian troops also downed two Russian early warning and control aircraft over the Sea of Azov in January and February, depriving the Russian military of some of its most precious intelligence-gathering assets.\n\nThe strikes followed other highly efficient Ukrainian attacks earlier in the war, including the April 2022 sinking of the Black Sea fleet’s flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, and a missile strike last September on the fleet’s headquarters in the port of Sevastopol.\n\nUKRAINE'S DEADLY WEAPONS\n\nThe smart use of remote-controlled drone boats laden with explosives has allowed Ukraine to tip the scales of naval warfare in its favor despite Russia's massive superiority in firepower. The Magura drones are equipped with advanced GPS and cameras, and have a low radar signature that makes them hard to detect.\n\nIts latest version, the Magura V5, is 5.5 meters (18 feet) long, weighs up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) and has a range of up to 800 kilometers (500 miles), 60 hours of battery life, and a 200-kilogram (440-pound) payload, according to Ukrainian authorities. It also beams live video to operators.\n\nUkraine also has relied on cruise missiles provided by the U.K. and France for striking Russian assets in Crimea. The missiles — produced jointly by Britain and France and called Storm Shadow by the U.K. and SCALP-EG by France — are launched from Ukraine's Soviet-era warplanes and have a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).\n\nWestern officials praise the efficiency of the Ukrainian attacks, noting that Kyiv has smartly used its limited resources to defeat far stronger Russian forces and destroy about 20% of the Black Sea fleet, effectively blunting Moscow’s naval dominance.\n\nENDING THE RUSSIAN BLOCKADE\n\nThe successful strikes on Russian naval assets have allowed Ukraine to increase its food and other Black Sea exports despite Russia’s withdrawal last summer from a deal that guaranteed safe shipment of Ukrainian grain.\n\nMoscow’s pullback from the deal raised the possibility of Russian attacks on ships carrying Ukrainian grain and other products, posing a threat to the Ukrainian economy and global food security.\n\nBut the steady series of successful Ukrainian attacks on Russian warships and other military assets in the area have put Russia's fleet on the defensive, limiting its offensive capability.\n\nHOW DID RUSSIA REACT?\n\nAlthough the Russian Defense Ministry has mostly kept quiet about the Ukrainian drone and missile attacks on its naval assets, Russian military bloggers and commentators have harshly criticized the military brass for its slow and sloppy response to the threat.\n\nThe strikes have forced the Russian navy to take precautions that have affected its operations, including relocating some of its ships from ports in Crimea farther east to Novorossiysk to better protect them.\n\nDespite the damage from Ukrainian attacks, the Black Sea fleet remains a powerful force and is still capable of launching long-range cruise missile strikes at Ukraine. Russian air bases in Crimea also have remained operational, hosting warplanes that have continued flying combat sorties to support its ground operations in the region.\n\nRussian military bloggers reported that the head of the Black Sea fleet, Adm. Viktor Sokolov, was dismissed last month following the latest losses of warships. There was no official confirmation of his ouster.\n\n___\n\nFind more AP coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5590539533038472,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":4130,"startIndex":3862,"uri":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-black-sea-f2e22f9f92caaae1b20044584fb58f6d"},{"endIndex":4972,"startIndex":4711,"uri":"https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/ukrainian-sea-drones-down-russian-warship-in-black-sea-kyiv-military-crimealatest-updates-2024-03-06-920094"},{"endIndex":5514,"startIndex":5277,"uri":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-black-sea-f2e22f9f92caaae1b20044584fb58f6d"},{"endIndex":6372,"startIndex":6147,"uri":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-black-sea-f2e22f9f92caaae1b20044584fb58f6d"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Black Sea\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   Kerch Strait\n*   Sea of Azov\n*   Crimea\n*   Feodosia\n*   Moscow\n*   Sevastopol\n*   U.K. (United Kingdom / Britain)\n*   France\n*   Kyiv\n*   Novorossiysk"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-48.07863998413086}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.091848Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dacjNBcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4447},"candidatesTokenCount":86,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":86}],"promptTokenCount":1086,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1086}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2262,"totalTokenCount":3434,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:50.740866+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: That data is vote history: a person-by-person record of who voted and who did not. It offers a definitive account of the makeup of the electorate, and it will help answer some of the most important questions of the primary season, from whether the Nikki Haley voters already back President Biden to whether the primary results suggest Mr. Biden is better positioned than the polls suggest.\n\nLast week, we got the first big tranche of vote history data from a place where we’ve done a recent state poll: Georgia.\n\nAt least here, it suggests that most Haley voters already supported Mr. Biden in 2020. It also implies that Mr. Biden’s strength in the primaries is not inconsistent with polls showing him struggling among young and Black voters.\n\nThe Haley vote in Georgia\n\nIn the Republican primary in Georgia, Ms. Haley received 13.2 percent of the vote. That may not have been anywhere near enough to win, but it could easily be enough to be a big headache for Donald J. Trump if those are Republicans who have soured on the former president.\n\nThe vote history data offers a few clues suggesting that Mr. Trump doesn’t have much to worry about here — or at least nothing new to worry about. Most of these voters already backed Mr. Biden in the 2020 election and continue to back him in 2024.\n\nThere are two pieces of evidence to support this idea.\n\nThe first comes from the vote history data from previous partisan primaries in Georgia. That data shows that about 10 percent of voters in this month’s Republican primary had voted in a Democratic primary in the last eight years — a good indication that they may have been Democrats voting in a Republican contest. These voters probably backed Ms. Haley by a wide margin.\n\nA second comes from our October Times/Siena survey of Georgia, which we matched to the new vote history records. Respondents who voted in the recent Republican presidential primary said they had voted for Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden by a margin of 82 percent to 12 percent in 2020, a tally similar to what these voters say they’ll do in November. Both tallies mirror Mr. Trump’s 85-13 victory in the Georgia primary.\n\nThe similarity between the Republican primary results and the poll responses of Republican primary voters suggest that most of Mr. Trump’s weakness in the primary simply came from those already inclined to back Mr. Biden in 2020 and 2024.\n\nAmong solid Republicans, Mr. Trump remains on stronger footing. He held a 94-2 polling lead over Mr. Biden among Republican primary voters who identified as Republicans in the Times/Siena survey. Similarly, he had a 91-3 lead among Republican primary voters who had not voted in a recent Democratic primary.\n\nWhat about Biden?\n\nThe Democratic primary has not been competitive this year, and Georgia was no exception. Overall, President Biden won 95 percent of the vote in Georgia, one of his best tallies anywhere in the country.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Times/Siena poll last fall found no evidence of serious dissent among these voters: Mr. Biden had a 96-0 lead over Mr. Trump among Times/Siena respondents who went on to vote in the Democratic primary, four months later.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that the Times/Siena poll found plenty of evidence of Democratic dissent among the broader group of registered voters. In the head-to-head polling matchup in Georgia in October, Mr. Trump led Mr. Biden by six points, including finding Mr. Biden at just 76-19 among Black voters overall. (In 2020, he won around 90 percent of the Black vote in Georgia.)\n\nSo why did Mr. Biden win a decisive victory when the polls showed him faring relatively poorly? The vote history data suggests the answer is simple: Those who voted in the Democratic primary and the broader group of registered voters are very different, with very different views of Mr. Biden.\n\nOverall, just 4 percent of registered voters turned out in the Democratic primary. Nearly half were 65 and over; just 5 percent were under 30. It turns out that this old and highly engaged group of Democrats is very loyal to Mr. Biden.\n\nThis is particularly clear seeing Biden’s support among Black voters, who account for over one-fourth of the electorate in Georgia.\n\nRemarkably, none of the Black voters who flirted with Mr. Trump in the October poll — those who said they would choose him in November 2024 — ended up voting in a primary, whether in the Republican primary or as Democratic dissenters. Mr. Biden led, 96-0, in the Times/Siena poll among self-identified Black voters who turned out in the March 12 primary, versus 74-21 among all other Black voters. Despite Mr. Trump’s support in the poll, only about 5 percent of Black primary voters decided to cast a ballot in the Republican primary, according to state voter records.\n\nThis is not the first time we’ve seen a big difference between primary voters and the rest of the electorate. In Times/Siena data, Mr. Biden is struggling badly among irregular young and nonwhite voters, helping to give Mr. Trump a narrow lead among registered voters nationwide. At the same time, Mr. Trump fares poorly among highly engaged voters, like those who vote in special elections.\n\nMr. Biden has major weaknesses in the polling, but his problems aren’t being put to the test in low-turnout primaries. The general election is when the irregular voters tend to show up, if they show up at all.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-5.385429859161377,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Georgia\n*   Nationwide"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-43.083438873291016}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:31.440667Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"X94dadvyGvDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4473},"candidatesTokenCount":8,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":8}],"promptTokenCount":1215,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1215}],"thoughtsTokenCount":454,"totalTokenCount":1677,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:37.284708+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: 7 March 2024, Krasnodar\n\nVladimir Putin held a working meeting with Krasnodar Territory Governor Veniamin Kondratyev.\n\nStarting the meeting, the President noted that the Krasnodar Territory was developing well, almost all its key performance indicators were good, and unemployment, which is at its lowest in the country, was below the national average in the region. Investment numbers are very good. Population growth is a core indicator, which, of course, raises social issues, such as increasing the number of ambulance crews and the capacity of kindergartens and schools.\n\nMr Kondratyev reported that the economy was steady and had adapted to the challenges and difficulties. The gross regional product amounted to four trillion rubles in late 2023 compared to two trillion rubles in 2018. Regional producers and businesses gained access to the domestic market. The ability to increase capacity and sell output on the domestic market is an important factor of growth.\n\nThe Governor also said that seven industrial parks had been built in the Krasnodar Territory, and seven more were under construction. Infrastructure loans, which the region receives from the federal budget as directed by the President, are crucial, especially for resorts. These loans will be used to build 17 treatment facilities on the Black Sea coast. The construction will begin this year.\n\nRegarding the agro-industrial complex, last year's harvest was quite good, even though not a record breaker at 14.4 million tonnes, of which wheat accounted for 9.6 million tonnes. Enterprises had sown 1.8 million hectares with winter crops and started sowing spring crops on 1.8 million hectares as well. A decent harvest is expected this year. Agrarians have been provided with fuel, fertiliser, and seeds in full. As of the end of last year, the agrarians have purchased various types of agricultural machinery worth 23 billion rubles. The law on viticulture and wine making has launched a new industry which was non-existent in the region literally until 2019, when wine making was a garage business. Since the time the law was passed in 2019, 1.5 billion bottles of champagne and wine have been produced. Last year alone, 305 million bottles were produced. Drinking wine and champagne from local wine material derived from local grapes grown in the Krasnodar Territory is now a sign of sophistication.\n\nVeniamin Kondratyev recalled that the Industrial Development Fund established with the President's support already has 7.1 billion rubles. These funds are spent on upgrading enterprises and import substitution production lines. The interest rate is kept low, under four percent. Last year, industrial product sales reached 1.8 trillion rubles. Owing to the fund, the amount of industrial output grew by almost 45 percent in five years.\n\nVladimir Putin also noted that investment in the health resort industry has increased a lot - from 18.6 billion to 488 billion. Veniamin Kondratyev said that due to the enactments of a corresponding territorial law, investment in new hotels has grown by 20 times since 2020. Currently, 48 hotels worth a total of almost 500 billion rubles are under construction in the Krasnodar Territory. About 30,000 new rooms will be ready for use by the end of next year. The Krasnodar Territory is the health resort and spa centre of the whole country. Last year, 18.6 million people spent their vacations there. This is a record, but not the limit. There will be demand for the hotels that are now under construction. The President emphasised the need to maintain continuous control over the quality of service.\n\nSchools and kindergartens were discussed as well. According to Mr Kondratyev, 90 schools, 194 kindergartens and 214 sports facilities have been built since 2016 when he became governor. Of this number, 42 schools, 61 kindergartens, 49 sports facilities and 70 general practitioner offices and rural paramedic centres have been built under national projects in the past five years. A total of 1,300 parks and squares were also improved under a national project.\n\nVladimir Putin noted the need to focus on the facilities in poor shape. Their problems should be resolved as soon as possible. They should undergo major repairs or be replaced with new facilities. Mr Kondratyev explained that about 30 clinics are under major repairs while 43 hospitals have already been rebuilt. The Governor emphasised that on the whole, the Krasnodar Territory received 260 billion rubles under this national project. This amount of social construction is unprecedented for the region.\n\nSource: President of the Russian Federation website in English 0700 gmt 12 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.720852013790246,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Krasnodar\n*   Krasnodar Territory\n*   Black Sea coast\n*   Russian Federation"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-56.788116455078125}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.577201Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4dabGdI8CSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3956},"candidatesTokenCount":33,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":33}],"promptTokenCount":1023,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1023}],"thoughtsTokenCount":923,"totalTokenCount":1979,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.452549+00:00"}

Over the past two years, he has at times drawn criticism for appearing to hesitate before pledging new weapons systems, such as the Leopard 2 battle tanks, to Kyiv.\n\nScholz has dug in much harder on Taurus missiles, though he has stopped short of explicitly ruling out ever delivering them.\n\n“From my point of view, this is a very long-range weapon,” he told parliament's lower house, the Bundestag. “Given the significance of not losing control over targets, this weapon could not be used without the deployment of German soldiers.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: * Will the Kremlin manipulate the results?\n\n* Can Russians protest?\n\n* Can Putin remain president for life?\n\n* When will the results be known?\n\n* Where can I find more information?\n\nWhy does this vote matter?\n\nThe presidential vote in Russia, which began Friday and lasts through Sunday, features the trappings of a horse race but is more of a predetermined, Soviet-style referendum.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin, 71, will undoubtedly win a fifth term, with none of the three other candidates who are permitted on the ballot presenting a real challenge. The main opposition figure who worked to spoil the vote, Aleksei A. Navalny, a harsh critic of Mr. Putin and the Ukraine war, died in an Arctic prison last month.\n\nStill, the vote is significant for Mr. Putin as a way to cement his legitimacy and refurbish his preferred image as the embodiment of security and stability. That image was tarnished when the war, advertised as a speedy operation to topple the government in Kyiv, turned into a slog that caused hundreds of thousands of casualties, ruptured relations with the West and ushered in harsher domestic repression.\n\n“The Kremlin needs to demonstrate huge popular support, and that this support has increased since the beginning of the war,” said Nikolay Petrov, a Russian political scientist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.\n\nDoes Putin face any serious challengers?\n\nThe Kremlin habitually ensures that Mr. Putin faces no real competition. The other candidates — all members of the State Duma, Russia’s rubber-stamp Parliament — voted for the war in Ukraine, for increased censorship and for laws curbing gay rights.\n\nNikolai Kharitonov, 75, of the Communist Party, already lost badly to Mr. Putin in 2004.\n\nLeonid Slutsky, 56 of the Liberal Democratic Party, a nationalist group loyal to Mr. Putin, has said he will not rally voters against the president.\n\nVladislav A. Davankov, 40, from the New People Party, is nominally liberal and has called for “peace” in Ukraine but has basically supported Mr. Putin.\n\nTwo candidates opposed to the war were disqualified. A veteran politician, Boris Nadezhdin, alarmed the Putin administration when tens of thousands of people across Russia lined up to sign petitions required for him to run. The Kremlin invalidated enough signatures to bar him.\n\nWill the Kremlin manipulate the results?\n\nRussia held real elections for about a decade after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Ever since, the Kremlin has relied on various social, geographic and technical levers to ensure that its candidate receives an overwhelming majority.\n\nAlthough Mr. Putin enjoys some support, the Kremlin has long sought to proclaim that he received more than 50 percent support in balloting, and also more support than he did in each previous vote. This year that means outstripping the 56 million votes that the authorities said he received in 2018; pundits are betting on 60 million.\n\nTwo important changes this time could add to the vote’s opacity.\n\nFor one, balloting will be held in the so-called “new territories,” the four Ukrainian regions Moscow annexed without fully controlling them. Russia’s election officials say the area has 4.5 million voters, an assertion virtually impossible to monitor amid a war.\n\n“We cannot check the figures there and the authorities will use them as they wish,” said Alexander V. Kynev, an independent election expert in Moscow.\n\nAlso, the ability to vote online will be more widely available, with electronic voters in 29 regions on one huge list, with no means to check where or how they voted, Mr. Kynev noted.\n\nIn a sprawling, diverse country like Russia, the Kremlin can also use more traditional means. Regions dominated by ethnic strongmen, like the Caucasus, habitually report huge turnouts with Mr. Putin receiving 99 percent of the vote — even if relatively few people show up at polling stations.\n\nAreas where state industries prevail also tend to report heavy support for the president. To turn out the vote, some polling stations hold raffles for prizes like household appliances or firewood. One Siberian region is offering 16,000 prizes.\n\nBut the Kremlin must rely on some votes in big cities, and that can get tricky. Excessive manipulation has created unrest previously. There might be slightly more manipulation this year because monitors are barred unless issued credentials by the candidates.\n\nCan Russians protest?\n\nWith street demonstrations banned, some Putin opponents hope to cast protest votes. The simplest method to lower his tally is to vote for someone else, experts noted.\n\n“Noon Against Putin,” a campaign pushed by Mr. Navalny’s organization, suggests swarming polling places at midday on Sunday. But there are a number of hurdles, including possible confrontations with the police.\n\nAlso, in previous votes, few polling stations had more than 3,000 registered voters and many had fewer than 1,000. “It is technically very complicated to create a crowd,” said David Kankiia, an analyst with the Golos election watchdog, barred in Russia.\n\nCan Putin remain president for life?\n\nSince he was first appointed successor to President Boris Yeltsin in 2000, Mr. Putin has said Russia’s Constitution would dictate the length of his tenure. Then he kept rewriting the Constitution.\n\nAsked in 2014 whether he would remain president forever, Mr. Putin responded, “This is not good and it is detrimental for the country and I do not need it either,” before adding, “We will see what the situation will be like, but in any case the term of my work is restricted by the Constitution.”\n\nIn 2008, when term limits forced him to step aside, he became prime minister under President Dmitri A. Medvedev, although Mr. Putin remained the power behind the throne until reclaiming the top job in 2012.\n\nPresidential terms were extended to six years before the 2018 vote, and then in 2020 Mr. Putin changed the constitution again to reset his term clock.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The situation around our country is growing worse. People are trying to drag us into processes which are completely detached from our own constructive interests. During a working visit to Hrodna Region, The [Belarusian] president [Alyaksandr Lukashenka, Alexander Lukashenko] stressed that any provocation against us would be cut off hard and fast.&#160;\n\n[Insertion] Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, during a meeting to assess the battle readiness of units and groups in Ashmyanski District on 26 March 2024: &#160;\"If they violate the state border - destroy them. No-one should be handled with kid gloves. And that is how we will act. Because any violation of the state border means destruction. They only understand force.\"&#160;\n\nWhy one needs to know history\n\nThe West is trying to tie us up in an arms race, and push us to militarise fruitful border lands and get us to pour human and material resources into military programmes and events. Military contingents belonging to countries whose capital are thousands of kilometres from us and with whom we have no common borders are being deployed densely along our border. The goal in this is clear - they are testing our resilience.&#160;\n\nGerman battalions and an American tank battalion have already taken up military positions in Lithuania's Pabrade. All of this is being done with clear designs of sabotage in mind.&#160;\n\nAlmost 150 Nato military, transport and reconnaissance aircraft are now based at Lithuanian airfields. The intensity and nature of this aviation group along our border is not merely hostile, they are provocative in every sense.&#160;\n\nThousands of Nato soldiers are training their battle skills at military training fields 15 kilometres from our border, working out tactics and ways of invading our territory.&#160;\n\nAlong the southern line, we already see the positions reflecting the best French lines dating to the era of Napoleon, whose standards are still remembered from the disgraceful rout in 1813 and the frozen fingers of French soldiers who miraculously survived Belarusian partisans, first on their way to Moscow and then on their way back to Paris.&#160;\n\nAnd just like carbon copy paper, the gloomy and infamous Bundeswehr has decided to accommodate itself to our north. During the Great Patriotic War they also got it handed to them by republican partisans. So bad that steel German boot heels flashed as they ran away.&#160;\n\nIs history for them really so covered in honey? One wonders why they are coming back again?\n\nA convincing warning\n\nHere I must note that any of our offers about transparent relations, peace initiatives and cooperation have been unilaterally rejected and flatly blocked with open hostility.\n\nUnfortunately, we have been forced to mirror these actions on our side. But our main objective is not to frighten, but to convince the military leadership of our neighbours that we are not here hunting mushrooms, that we are not joking around and that any provocation will be cut off hard and fast without any warning shot or any chance for a second take. We have been patient for too long in indulging the disdain they have for us to even inadvertently push a peaceful situation into the rut of a conflict. But that was possible at former balances of force.\n\nNow we see a systemic growth on the line of contact along our border. The growth of military potential enabled by the administrations of our neighbours makes any condescension not only improper, but also very dangerous for our country and population.\n\nThose who accuse us of threatening to attack were the first to exit peace agreements and revoke and break all agreements about military parity. The bordering side treats any step towards agreement exclusively as a loss and defeat. And so there is no-one to make any agreement with on any topic today.&#160;\n\nYes, that line of behaviour was put in place by those who inhabit Nato's eastern flank. And by this same scheme, they are the kamikazes of the North Atlantic alliance. Well, what else can one think about countries where the last drops of industry and economy are being destroyed and whose territory is being used to move military infrastructure for Nato contingents towards Drang nach Osten? They are simply being used in the classic, throwaway scenario. And that's it. Nothing more.\n\nThat is what the president is trying to warn colleague neighbours in the Baltics, Poland and Ukraine.&#160;\n\nA fragile edge\n\nDuring an inspection of units and subunits along the border in Hrodna Region, the head of state took the moment to demonstrate that we are also serious, but that we have a better plan, which would allow everyone, and not just one side, to survive. We are calling on our neighbours to stop and not unloose the knot of aggression.\n\nEveryone has already practically shown they are ready to and capable of crossing into what we call active movement. There is no sense in sabre rattling. Our side does not intend to war with our neighbours, the West, Nato or anyone at all - that is our main message to everyone. We are happy to turn our swords into plowshares, just give us a reason. For now it is impossible to get rid of the fear always threatening everyone.&#160;\n\nLukashenka noted in Hrodna Region that we are an economically and politically strong country, we are a nuclear and space state and the \"red lines\" are not just a drawing on a map, but the thin and fragile edge between life and death. We only want one thing - mutual respect. And so the president's peaceful message to our neighbours is like that marking on fragile cargo designating everyone's responsibility for peace and life - \"do not shake and do not throw\".\n\nThe original article can be found and read here.\n\nSource: Belarus Segodnya, Minsk, in Russian 0540 GMT 28 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.0549276365456006,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Hrodna Region (Belarus)\n*   Ashmyanski District (Belarus)\n*   Lithuania\n*   Pabrade (Lithuania)\n*   Moscow (Russia)\n*   Paris (France)\n*   Baltics (region)\n*   Poland\n*   Ukraine\n*   Minsk (Belarus)\n*   Belarus (implied as \"our country\" and from \"Belarusian president\")\n*   Germany (implied from \"German battalions\" and \"Bundeswehr\")\n*   United States (implied from \"American tank battalion\")\n*   France (implied from \"French lines\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-148.7447967529297}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.046111Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daZ_oAsCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4848},"candidatesTokenCount":141,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":141}],"promptTokenCount":1232,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1232}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1116,"totalTokenCount":2489,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.86074+00:00"}

He mentioned that Gwadar and surrounding areas in South Balochistan have been badly affected by recent heavy rains. He reported that the prime minister announced \"financial support packages\" for the affected people in the area.&#160;\n\nRehman mentioned that earlier in his speech in the National Assembly, the prime minister had emphasised the need for \"tough measures\" and \"unpopular decisions\" to turn around the economy of Pakistan. He spoke to Khaqan Najeeb, an expert on economic affairs and asked him to comment on the prime minister's visit to Gwadar. Najeeb said the visit was a good step by the new government because Gwadar is important in connection with the CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor]. He said Gwadar was being built as a new city so it should be ensured that it has a \"world-class\" drainage and sanitation system and that in the future such problems do not occur. He also noted that Gwadar port is important for the future trade by Pakistan with regional countries including China.\n\nAbdullah Mohmand, an analyst, said a day earlier the prime minister in his speech in the National Assembly had emphasised that he would try to address the \"issues and grievances of the people of Balochistan\" and today he visited Balochistan. He noted that by visiting the calamity-stricken people of Balochistan the prime minister \"assured the people there that the government would provide them all kind of support\". He mentioned that development works in the area would only be possible when the people there \"trust the government and the state\".&#160;\n\nSpeaking about the challenges faced by the new government Mohmand said the \"biggest challenge\" was political instability because without political stability neither the economy could be improved nor the issues of climate change could be addressed. He said: \"The economy is in turmoil at the moment\" and foreign investment would not come to Pakistan unless there is political stability and terrorist incidents do not take place. He noted that during the past year, a very large number of terrorist attacks took place in Pakistan. He also noted that climate change was a huge challenge for Pakistan.&#160; &#160;\n\nSenior analyst P J Mir said the question is \"What kind of planning was done while building the city that it could not sustain a calamity\". He said: \"This happened because we did not plan for bad times\". He said the visit was needed for \"appeasement\" but the prime minister should not be taking every burden. He said the prime minister should delegate the authority to the chief minister. He appreciated that the disaster-stricken people were being provided \"relief\".&#160;\n\nJaved Siddique, a senior journalist and analyst, was of the view that the prime minister's decision to visit Gwadar should be appreciated because it is a place of \"strategic importance\" and \"the future of our trade is linked with it\". He expressed the view that Balochistan needed a \"healing touch\" as the Baloch nationalist parties keep complaining that Balochistan has been ignored and some \"anti-Pakistan foreign forces also exploit such issues\" which has created \"issues of militancy and insurgency\" in the area. He said in this context the Prime Minister took a timely step by giving priority to Balochistan. He emphasised that the federal and provincial governments should show that \"Balochistan is their primary concern\".\n\nRehman questioned whether Asif Ali Zardari, the co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party [PPP], who is the presidential candidate of the parties in the government was in a \"comfortable position\" for his election on 9 March. Mohmand said the PPP has contacted various parties and was in a strong position in Sindh while having sufficient support in the Punjab and Balochistan assemblies and the National Assembly.\n\nMir said Zardari was in a comfortable position as he had the numbers. He appreciated that PPP and PML-N which were \"arch-rivals\" have joined together \"for the sake of the country\".\n\nSiddique said Zardari would be elected the president comfortably and recalled that in the past when Zardari was the president of the country he conducted his office \"very smoothly\". He was of the view that Zardari, as president, would try to play a role in bringing the opposition and the PML-N government closer.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 5 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.046677102847975,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Gwadar\n*   Balochistan\n*   National Assembly\n*   Pakistan\n*   China\n*   Sindh\n*   Punjab\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-51.28717803955078}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.805491Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dafOUMeuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3807},"candidatesTokenCount":49,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":49}],"promptTokenCount":958,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":958}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1638,"totalTokenCount":2645,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.917231+00:00"}

Tension is building up not too far from the Indian mainland. In the Maldives, China is laying the foundation for an outpost and Beijing has signed a secret defence deal with Male.\"\n\nThe anchor added, \"What this deal encompasses, one cannot tell for sure and China will not tell.

But the question is at what cost and in exchange for what? Perhaps using the Maldives as an outpost?\"\n\nThe anchor added, \"What Male is failing to see here is that this is not a friendly neighbour trying to help a poor island nation. The dragon's [China's] designs are not benign and it's not seeking a partnership with the Maldives. China, in fact, is preparing for war with India in the Indian Ocean and it is looking for a platform.\"\n\nThe anchor also said, \"The Maldives and its dreams of partnership with China are just collateral damage, serving as nothing but a platform for China to set up a base in India's backyard.\"\n\nAnother privately-owned, prominent English-language TV news channel, NDTV 24X7, on its show, \"Left, Right & Centre\" (at 21:30 IST or 16:00 GMT) also highlighted this development.\n\nAnchor Vishnu Som said, \"The equation between India and the Maldives, which has been fairly testy over the last couple of months, seems to have hit a new roadblock with the government of [Maldivian President] President Mohamed Muizzu signing a new agreement with China where China has apparently offered free military aid to Male.\"\n\nSom added, \"This comes at a time when the Chinese 'spy ships', 'research vessels' is what they call them, have been docking in Maldivian ports. It also comes at a time when there's been concerns raised by the Maldivian opposition on what exactly the President is doing.\"\n\nHe further mentioned, \"The President making it quite clear that China is the country that he sees equations with, perhaps most closely. India not in that equation, at least not in the way it once was. What's more, the Maldives has made it clear that they want Indian [military] personnel off the island.\"\n\nSpeaking on the show, Dr RK Radhakrishnan, India-based expert on Maldives, said, \"A lot has changed&#8230; The couple of people [opposition leaders] who had backed the motion [against President Muizzu] had backed out because Muizzu offered them ministerships or good positions in government&#8230; Number two, the delay in the election [reportedly from March to now in April]&#8230; gives Muizzu enough and more time to actually come with a coercive response to the Indian offer that civilians will replace military personnel in the Island.\"\n\nPolitical narratives on general elections&#160; &#160;\n\nPrivately-owned, pro-government English-language TV news channel, India Today, on its show, \"News Today\" (at 21:10 IST or 15:40 GMT) discussed political narratives regarding the forthcoming general elections.\n\nAnchor Rajdeep Sardesai asked Rahul Verma of think tank Centre for Policy Research, \"You are hearing the Prime Minister [PM] Narendra Modi go across the country on this whistle-stop tour, speaking of his dream of a 'developed India'. Of course, he attacks the opposition on familialism and other issues but the core of his appeal is 'I am going to give you [people] a dream of a stronger, stable India'.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, [opposition Congress party leader] Rahul Gandhi, on his 'Nyaya Yatra' [march for justice] is going along raising issues like&#8230; people are unemployed and that the&#8230; [people from so-called lower castes] are losing out. So, you have two clear narratives emerging. How do you see this playing out politically?\" he added.\n\nVerma said, \"What we saw in that survey ['Mood of the Nation' survey conducted by the channel] that there is a disjunction between what voters think on questions relating to economy and how they are behaving politically. Price rise, unemployment there was [of] high concern. There was support for [a] nationwide caste census&#8230; A large number of people agree with these issues but on the political side, they seem to be thinking that [the] Modi government is doing well.\" &#160;\n\nHe said, \"PM Modi remains popular and people are much more likely to vote for BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] in comparison to [the] past. So, what this suggests that perhaps voters do not have enough trust on opposition to be able to deliver on some of those issues which concern them.\"\n\nAnother popular, pro-government Hindi TV news channel, Aaj Tak, on its show \"Black and White\" (at 21:15 IST or 15:45 GMT) also focused on this news.\n\nAnchor Sudhir Chaudhary said, \"Are opposition parties trying to win the [lower house of parliament] Lok Sabha election by insulting [Hindu deity] Lord Ram and Hinduism? Is it not that while criticising PM Modi and protesting against them, these opposition leaders have in fact now started to insult Lord Ram himself?\"\n\nChaudhary added, \"[southern state] Tamil Nadu's DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] party MP and former UPA [United Progressive Alliance government] minister A Raja, in his new statement, has said that he does not believe in Lord Ram and [Hindu epic] Ramayana and does not even believe that [Hindu deity] Lord Hanuman is a god.\"\n\nHe mentioned, \"DMK is the same party whose leader Udhayanidhi Stalin had compared Hinduism with diseases such as dengue and malaria. DMK's MP Senthilkumar had said that the people of north India are simply confined to cows and 'gau mutra' [cow urine]. And now, the same party's MP A Raja, while taking advantage of freedom of expression, is mocking Lord Hanuman and using insulting words for Lord Ram.\"\n\nAlleged gang rape of foreign tourist\n\nProminent, privately-owned pro-government Hindi TV news channel, Zee News, on its show, \"DNA\" (at 21:20 IST or 15:50 GMT) reported about the alleged gang rape of a foreign tourist.\n\nThe anchor said, \"In Indian culture, we have the tradition of treating the guest as God, which means that if a guest comes to our home, we should welcome them like we would welcome God&#8230; But the thinking of some people has been polluted so badly that instead of treating guests [of the country] as God, they don't even shy away from committing crimes against them.\"\n\nThe anchor added, \"From the past four days, an incident which took place with a foreign guest is being discussed in the entire country&#8230; In [eastern state] Jharkhand's Dumka, eight men committed a gruesome crime like a gang rape with a Spanish travel blogger. Whenever an incident takes place with a foreign guest, it ruins India's image at the international level.\"\n\nThe anchor mentioned, \"For this, our society and system are responsible at large.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Just days later came a searing counterpoint: His vaunted security apparatus failed to prevent Russia’s deadliest terrorist attack in 20 years.\n\nThe assault on Friday, which killed at least 133 people at a concert hall in suburban Moscow, was a blow to Mr. Putin’s aura as a leader for whom national security is paramount. That is especially true after two years of a war in Ukraine that he describes as key to Russia’s survival — and which he cast as his top priority after the election last Sunday.\n\n“The election demonstrated a seemingly confident victory,” Aleksandr Kynev, a Russian political scientist, said in a phone interview from Moscow. “And suddenly, against the backdrop of a confident victory, there’s this demonstrative humiliation.”\n\nMr. Putin seemed blindsided by the assault. It took him more than 19 hours to address the nation about the attack, the deadliest in Russia since the 2004 school siege in Beslan, in the country’s south, which claimed 334 lives. When he did, the Russian leader said nothing about the mounting evidence that a branch of the Islamic State committed the attack.\n\nInstead, Mr. Putin hinted that Ukraine was behind the tragedy and said the assailants had acted “just like the Nazis,” who “once carried out massacres in the occupied territories” — evoking his frequent, false description of present-day Ukraine as being run by neo-Nazis.\n\n“Our common duty now — our comrades at the front, all citizens of the country — is to be together in one formation,” Mr. Putin said at the end of a five-minute speech, trying to conflate the fight against terrorism with his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe question is how much of the Russian public will buy into his argument. They might ask whether Mr. Putin, with the invasion and his conflict with the West, truly has the country’s security interests at heart — or whether he is woefully forsaking them, as many of his opponents say he is.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Putin apparently ignored a warning from the United States about a potential terrorist attack is likely to deepen the skepticism. Instead of acting on the warnings and tightening security, he dismissed them as “provocative statements.”\n\n“All this resembles outright blackmail and an intention to intimidate and destabilize our society,” Mr. Putin said on Tuesday in a speech to the F.S.B., Russia’s domestic intelligence agency, referring to the Western warnings. After the attack on Friday, some of his exiled critics have cited his response as evidence of the president’s detachment from Russia’s true security concerns.\n\nRather than keeping society safe from actual, violent terrorists, those critics say, Mr. Putin has directed his sprawling security services to pursue dissidents, journalists and anyone deemed a threat to the Kremlin’s definition of “traditional values.”\n\nA case in point: Just hours before the attack, state media reported that the Russian authorities had added “the L.G.B.T. movement” to an official list of “terrorists and extremists”; Russia had already outlawed the gay rights movement last year. Terrorism was also among the many charges prosecutors leveled against Aleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned opposition leader who died last month.\n\n“In a country in which counterterrorism special forces chase after online commenters,” Ruslan Leviev, an exiled Russian military analyst, wrote in a social media post on Saturday, “terrorists will always feel free.”\n\nEven as the Islamic State repeatedly claimed responsibility for the attack and Ukraine denied any involvement, the Kremlin’s messengers pushed into overdrive to try to persuade the Russian public that this was merely a ruse.\n\nOlga Skabeyeva, a state television host, wrote on Telegram that Ukrainian military intelligence had found assailants “who would look like ISIS. But this is no ISIS.” Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the state-run RT television network, wrote that reports of Islamic State responsibility amounted to a “basic sleight of hand” by the American news media.\n\nOn a prime-time television talk show on the state-run Channel 1, Russia’s best-known ultraconservative ideologue, Aleksandr Dugin, declared that Ukraine’s leadership and “their puppet masters in the Western intelligence services” had surely organized the attack.\n\nIt was an effort to “undermine trust in the president,” Mr. Dugin said, and it showed regular Russians that they had no choice but to unite behind Mr. Putin’s war against Ukraine.\n\nMr. Dugin’s daughter was killed in a car bombing near Moscow in 2022 that U.S. officials said was indeed authorized by parts of the Ukrainian government, but without American involvement.\n\nU.S. officials have said there is no evidence of Ukrainian involvement in the concert hall attack, and Ukrainian officials ridiculed the Russian accusations. Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, said Mr. Putin’s claim that the attackers had fled toward Ukraine and intended to cross into it, with the help of the Ukrainian authorities, made no sense.\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Putin has appeared more confident than at any other point since he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russian forces have retaken the initiative on the front line, while Ukraine is struggling amid flagging Western support and a shortage of troops.\n\nInside Russia, the election — and its predetermined outcome — underscored Mr. Putin’s dominance over the nation’s politics.\n\nMr. Kynev, the political scientist, said he believed many Russians were now in “shock,” because “restoring order has always been Vladimir Putin’s calling card.”\n\nMr. Putin’s early years in power were marked by terrorist attacks, culminating in the Beslan school siege in 2004; he used those violent episodes to justify his rollback of political freedoms. Before Friday, the most recent mass-casualty terrorist attack in the capital region was a suicide bombing at an airport in Moscow in 2011 that killed 37 people.\n\nStill, given the Kremlin’s efficacy in cracking down on dissent and the news media, Mr. Kynev predicted that the political consequences of the concert hall attack would be limited, as long as the violence was not repeated.\n\n“To be honest,” he said, “our society has gotten used to keeping quiet about inconvenient topics.”\n\nConstant Méheut contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.8478128769818474,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   Moscow (specifically \"suburban Moscow\" and an \"airport in Moscow\")\n*   Ukraine\n*   Beslan\n*   United States (or U.S.)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-94.23845672607422}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.482175Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daf-2HeuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5346},"candidatesTokenCount":51,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":51}],"promptTokenCount":1347,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1347}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1084,"totalTokenCount":2482,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.604984+00:00"}

He mentioned former president Asif Ali Zardari sent a presidential reference to the Supreme Court in 2008 for a review of the judgement. Raza said it is a welcome development that an institution has admitted its mistake.\n\nRaza asked senior lawyer Yasin Azad why a decision on the reference took such a long time. Azad noted Asif Ali Zardari sent the reference when he was the president and the judgement has been given at a time when Zardari might again be made the president on 9 March. He said usually the trial of a murder case is conducted in a sessions court, but Bhutto's case was initiated directly in the Lahore High Court. He added out of the seven judges, three had declared that it was not a murder case and ordered Bhutto's acquittal, but four judges upheld the death sentence. He mentioned Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, a member of the bench hearing the case, later wrote in his book and also said in a TV interview that Bhutto's sentence was a judicial murder.\n\nAzad claimed everyone in Pakistan said that Bhutto's sentence was against the law. He said he would give credit to the present-day Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, which took up the review case. He remarked in a short order, the Supreme Court as an institution, has admitted that requirements of justice were not fulfilled.\n\nAzad said there are several other cases in which \"disputed judgements\" have been issued and they should be revisited by a full court. He complained the parliament \"does not play its due role in legislation\". He noted ever since Chief Justice Isa has taken over the office, the Supreme Court has \"recognised the supremacy of the parliament\", which is a welcome development. He said there are many \"difficulties\" in the Constitution which should be removed by the parliament.\n\nPPP politician Syed Hasan Murtaza said it is good that such a verdict has been given which has \"helped in correcting the history\" and a family [referring to the Bhutto family] has finally been awarded justice after 44 years. He was of the view that it would have been better if a verdict had been issued which stated that it was a judicial murder and had also identified the murderers.\n\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Raja Qamar ul Islam, noting that the correction came after 44 years, said it is \"better late than never\" and termed it a sign of \"judicial evolution\". He noted the PML-N and PPP remained hostile towards each other for several years but they also signed a \"charter of democracy\" and resolved to move forward after admitting their mistakes.\n\nSpeaking about the controversy around the recent election results and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) allegations that the results were manipulated, Azad said the PTI will have to prove its allegations before the election tribunals through evidence.\n\nCommenting on the continuous protests by the PTI, Murtaza remarked such acts are damaging to the country and the democratic system. He urged Imran Khan (former PTI chairperson) to stop the confrontation and maintain a \"working relationship\" in the parliament as political instability would further devastate the economy.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 6 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.5105209350585938,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"The locations mentioned in the article are:\n\n*   Lahore\n*   Pakistan\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-77.23146057128906}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.169058Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94daeKoCsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2843},"candidatesTokenCount":22,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":22}],"promptTokenCount":735,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":735}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1225,"totalTokenCount":1982,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.679193+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Malik noted negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have entered the \"final round\" and it is expected that a letter of intent would be issued by the night of 19 March. He said an arrangement with the IMF is important for Pakistan to fill the gap in its \"balance of payments\" as other countries and institutions which gave loans to Pakistan have agreed to extend their support once the country is in an IMF programme. He mentioned Pakistan not only needs the last tranche of the current programme, but also wants to enter into a larger programme for three to four years.\n\nMalik further noted inflation is not likely to decrease because under the IMF's conditions, the interest rate should be kept high, value of the rupee should be flexible, and power and gas tariffs should be increased.\n\nInterview with minister of planning\n\nMalik spoke with Minister of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal and asked him for how long the economy of Pakistan would remain weak. Iqbal said the current economic situation of the economy is certainly very challenging. He remarked it is not an underdeveloped economy, but an \"under-managed or mismanaged economy\" that can start a journey towards robust growth and development if its resources are used properly. He noted the main issue with Pakistan is its \"political instability\" because of which economic policies have been \"reversed and disbanded\" repeatedly. He emphasised political stability and continuity along with right economic policies could lead to economic progress.\n\nMalik remarked a \"civil-military dialogue\" is necessary so that the military establishment stops \"experiments\" of intervention to install people of its choice for managing the economy. Iqbal was of the view that there is a realisation [within the military establishment] that continuity is necessary and the objective of the Special Investment Facilitation Council is to end tension and mistrust and take decisions with everyone's ownership in a \"whole of government approach\". He said there is need for an \"economic National Action Plan\" on the same lines as the National Action Plan against terrorism which was devised with a consensus from all.\n\nIqbal termed the meeting between KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif a \"very positive development\". Talking about Gandapur's arrest warrants, he said it may be a part of the judicial process and hoped that it would not cause any disruption that would increase political confrontation. He commented the people of Pakistan will not support any kind of \"negative politics\" in the current scenario. He expressed confidence that an agreement with the IMF would be finalised soon.\n\nArrest warrants against Gandapur\n\nMalik asked KP government's spokesperson Muhammad Ali Saif about his reaction to the arrest warrants against Gandapur. Saif said it is a \"routine action\" and not a big legal or political issue as issuing bailable or non-bailable warrants during case proceedings is a normal procedure under the criminal procedure code. He claimed the Punjab government \"does not want to miss any opportunity to exploit an issue against PTI members\", so it would keep highlighting this issue.\n\nSaif said the PTI would like to get the problems of KP resolved through dialogue with a \"positive mind\" and that is why Gandapur held a meeting with the prime minister. However, he added, it cannot be a one-sided process and the other side should also reciprocate.\n\nReplying to Malik's question on why the KP government is demanding that Imran Khan (PTI founder) should be handed over to it from the Adiala jail in Punjab, Saif said the Punjab government has been saying that there are threats to jails in Punjab, which is a \"pretext to disallow people from meeting Khan\". He added if Khan is not safe in one of the largest jails of Punjab, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should hand him over to the KP government.\n\nSource: Samaa TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500 GMT 19 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.553512387159394,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)\n*   Punjab\n*   Adiala jail\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-63.694007873535156}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.022306Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"bN4daaKuAeuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3366},"candidatesTokenCount":41,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":41}],"promptTokenCount":794,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":794}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1333,"totalTokenCount":2168,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:50.1374+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The official visit by Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian to Armenia will take place on 18-19 August, not 18-21 August as reported earlier, Armenpress state-owned news agency reports, quoting the office of the Armenian prime minister.\n\nPro-Moscow group calls for rally against anti-Russian protest\n\nThe Mother Armenia movement has called for a public gathering in response to a protest planned against the Russian 102nd military base stationed in Gyumri.\n\nThe call comes after the pro-Western For the Republic party announced plans to stage a protest outside the base on 23 August to call for the closure of the base and for Armenia's withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).\n\nIn June, Yerevan had said that it had no plans to shut down the base and that under the current agreement, the lease runs until 2044.\n\nMother Armenia said in a statement that the pre-announced anti-Russia protest is being organised by \"pro-Western forces that are pursuing anti-Armenian interests\".\n\nThe movement condemned \"provocative actions\" aimed at undermining the presence of the Russian military in Armenia and described the base as a key component of national security.\n\nThe statement further warned that \"following the fall of [breakaway] Karabakh, rising tensions in Syunik, and the de facto establishment of the Zangazur corridor [aka Trump Route - a prospective route via southern Armenia], efforts are now being directed at removing the Russian base, a step that would pave the way for Armenia's complete capitulation to Turkey and Azerbaijan\".\n\nThe statement also called on the Gyumri mayor and law enforcers to prevent the anti-Russian protest, arguing that it serves the interests of Armenia's adversaries.\n\nWashington deals draw criticism from opposition\n\nArmenia's parliamentary opposition has described the declaration signed by the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders in Washington on 8 August as a \"new existential threat\" and an act of \"capitulation\" for Armenia, Azaturtyun.am, the Armenian service of Radio Liberty, has said.\n\nThe Armenia faction said the peace deal with Azerbaijan, initialled in the States, legitimised Azerbaijan's \"ethnic cleansing\" in Karabakh, would erase the issue from the international agenda and lead the way for further Azerbaijani \"aggression\" through an \"unimpeded corridor\" - the so-called Trump Route, aka Zangazur corridor - through Armenia.\n\n\"No one can point to what exactly the Armenian interest is in this document - aside from the word 'peace' written on the paper, is there anything truly positive for Armenia?\" said Artsvik Minasyan, secretary of the opposition Armenia faction in an interview with Azatutyun.\n\nNon-parliamentary opposition figure Edmon Marukyan raised concern over the lack of a clearly defined map in the agreement, arguing that this leaves Armenia vulnerable to possible future Azerbaijani territorial claims, the report said.\n\nPolitical analyst Stepan Danielyan warned that Armenia's agreement to allow Azerbaijani checkpoints in Armenia's southern Syunik Region without any Armenian control undermines Armenia's sovereignty. He also raised concern about the possible involvement of foreign private security forces.\n\nDanielyan linked the timing of the Washington deal to the upcoming USA-Russia summit, suggesting it was used to strengthen the US position during the talks with Russia.\n\nHe also pointed to broader geopolitical risks, noting rising influence from the UK, Turkey and Israel in Azerbaijan, and warned the deal could further entrench great power competition in the region.\n\nFormer Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian (Vardan Oskanyan) harshly criticised the \"government's concessions\" over the so-called Zangazur corridor, accusing the authorities of presenting a \"strategic defeat\" as a \"strategic victory\".\n\nOskanian said that handing over a strip of land stretching from east to west under conditions allowing unimpeded Azerbaijani access for 99 years without customs checks, border control or the right to inspect what passes through constitutes a loss of national sovereignty.\n\n\"No political manoeuvre can change this reality. You are leasing part of your sovereignty for at least two generations. This is not diplomacy; it is the sale of national dignity,\" he said, describing the proposed route as a \"corridor of dependence and humiliation\".\n\nThe website of the pro-opposition Hraparak daily says that following the Washington declaration a harsh Russian reaction was expected, with many predicting that Moscow would not forgive Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan for \"ditching\" it and abandoning the Russian-mediated 9 November 2020 deal. The daily, however, says that sources close to the Russian authorities say Moscow is largely indifferent to developments in and around Armenia.\n\nAccording to the daily, various Russian government circles have conveyed to Armenian counterparts that no steps will be taken if the Armenian public considers the latest developments acceptable. The daily says that even Iran has sought clarity on Russia's stance to coordinate its own actions but received the same response.\n\nSources cited by the daily say the main reason for this attitude is that Russia is waiting to see what kind of resolution there will be on the Ukrainian front. Moscow believes that the Washington agreement has so many pitfalls that its implementation is simply unrealistic. But through internal channels, they have also made it clear to the Armenian authorities that regarding the unblocking of regional roads, they are in favour of implementing the trilateral agreements negotiated with their participation.\n\nThe daily concludes that Moscow has decided to closely observe how far Armenia's leadership will go, questioning how a government that spent four years negotiating with Russia and had a 30-year partnership could suddenly pivot to the USA. The daily says that once they understand it, they will plan their actions accordingly.\n\nSeparately, Hraparak says, citing its sources, that before signing the Washington deals, Azerbaijan not only engaged in prolonged preparatory work but also launched psychological pressure campaigns targeting Armenia's leadership, exploiting their known vulnerabilities.\n\nSources say that over the past month, Azerbaijani military aircraft conducted repeated reconnaissance flights along Armenia's borders, displaying \"aggressive\" behaviour. The Armenian government reportedly failed to grasp the real motive behind this increased activity, especially given that the Washington meetings and the intialling of the peace deal had already been agreed upon.\n\nThe daily also reports that Armenia's Foreign Intelligence Service provided a briefing to the government, warning that Azerbaijan was discussing multiple scenarios, and if \"the negotiations regarding the Zangazur corridor fail, Azerbaijan, with the support of Turkey, is ready to use force to seize key parts of Syunik Region\". This, the daily says, effectively put an end to all hesitation, and Pashinyan hastily went and signed everything, exclusively in the context of Azerbaijani demands. While some believe this information was deliberately leaked by Azerbaijan as part of its \"cunning\" politics, the daily notes that fear ultimately silenced rational voices within the Armenian leadership.\n\nSeparately, Hraparak's website says that the published text of the peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan initialled in Washington contains no provisions favourable to Armenia.\n\nThe daily says that the document makes no mention of the rights of Karabakh Armenians, the release of Armenians held by Baku, the withdrawal of Azerbaijani troops from \"occupied\" Armenian territories, or any specific map for border delimitation. Instead, it includes clauses that are not only not aimed at establishing peace, but will also provoke internal unrest, plunge Armenia into a new period of turbulence, create new and unsolvable problems, and lay the groundwork for new concessions.\n\nThe daily highlights Clauses 8 and 9 of the treaty as particularly problematic. Clause 8 states that the parties condemn and will combat intolerance, racial hatred, separatism, and terrorism. The daily questions why such language is included, given that both countries are already party to relevant international conventions.\n\nThe answer, the daily says, lies in Clause 9, which obliges both sides to address cases of missing persons and enforced disappearances from the conflict through information exchange, noting that relevant arrangements will be negotiated and thoroughly agreed upon in a separate agreement. Thus, according to Clause 9, a separate agreement addressing all the above-mentioned issues still needs to be concluded, the contents of which and the pitfalls it may contain for Armenia are unknown.\n\nThe daily warns that this clause could enable Azerbaijan to demand criminal investigations into participants in the First Karabakh War, targeting Armenian military figures and war veterans under the pretext of implementing justice. And if Armenia rejects such demands, it could be accused of supporting separatism, undermining Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, or obstructing justice.\n\nFurthermore, the daily warns that Baku will demand to punish all the \"revanchists\", those accusing Azerbaijan of vandalism and genocide, those fighting against the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Karabakh, and so on. All of this, the daily says, would be coordinated through a follow-up agreement, uniquely required only for these specific clauses out of the treaty's 17 clauses, suggesting their strategic importance to both Baku and, potentially, the current Armenian leadership.\n\nFinally, the daily argues, this follow-up agreement may be used not only to suppress domestic opposition to Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, but also to silence those opposing Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Azerbaijani \"aggression\".\n\nMinister praises Baku-Yerevan declaration\n\nMeanwhile, Armenian Economy Minister Gevorg Papoyan highlighted the economic significance of the Washington declaration. He noted that during the Iran-Israel war, the South Caucasus served as the only safe air route, prompting global recognition of the need for a secure land route as well. He said the new corridor will turn Armenia into a key cargo hub between China and Europe, enhancing its security importance as any disruption during future conflicts would draw greater international attention. He added that cargo transit through Armenia will generate customs revenue, infrastructure development and economic benefits. Additionally, the opening of new routes will reduce transportation costs for Armenian exports and with the reopening of the Turkish border, Armenia can access Mediterranean ports, which could further lower import and export costs.\n\nAccording to Papoyan, the agreement will lead to significant economic investments and boost exports, imports and overall foreign investment in Armenia. Papoyan stated that as a transport hub, Armenia will play a key role in global trade and enhance its strategic importance and security. He said that if US companies build a railway along the potential Trump Route for Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP; aka Zangazur corridor, via southern Armenia), it would not harm Armenia but would bring major benefits and operate under Armenian law, just like the Russian Railways currently does. He said Armenia should find a formula to live peacefully with its neighbours and the agreement signed in Washington is that formula. Those who oppose it, he argued, prefer Armenia to remain a tool in the hands of other powers and reject peace. Papoyan added that the new route would also be economically beneficial for Iran, as it would allow direct access from Armenia's Meghri to Azerbaijan's Naxcivan railway, then through Armenia's Yeraskh into Armenia, enabling faster cargo transport. He noted that both Iran's president and foreign minister have confirmed they see no security risks in this arrangement.\n\nPapoyan also noted that there are no issues with Russia regarding this matter, as Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), maintains close partnership with Russia and is a strategic ally. He emphasised that all relevant matters are resolved within this relationship.\n\nExiled separatist Karabakh MPs say Baku-Yerevan peace deal omits key issues\n\nParliamentary factions of Azerbaijan's defunct breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region have issued a statement in response to the 8 August trilateral meeting of the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and the United States in Washington.\n\nWhile acknowledging past international peace efforts, the parliamentary factions criticised the dissolution of the OSCE Minsk Group and accused its co-chairs of abandoning their mediation role. They said that the lack of condemnation of the 2020 Karabakh war, which they said was started by Baku, led to further escalation and the exodus of Karabakh Armenians in 2023, and that the Minsk Group ignored the International Court of Justice resolution on the right of Karabakh Armenians to return to their homes.\n\nThe statement warned that any Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal excluding key issues, such as the safe return of Karabakh Armenians, protection of cultural heritage, and the release of Armenian detainees held by Baku would fail to deliver a lasting peace. The statement called for a process based on justice, rights and mutual trust.\n\nArmenia, Georgia discuss regional peace prospects\n\nArmenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan has told his Georgian counterpart Maka Bochorishvili in a phone call that Baku and Yerevan's Washington deals are a fresh opportunity for regional cooperation and peace, News.am said.\n\nCommenting on the outcomes of the 8 August meetings in Washington, Mirzoyan emphasised that the agreements reached create new opportunities for regional cooperation and peace. The sides also discussed their bilateral partnership agenda.\n\nRussia allocates 25m dollars for Armenia's school meals programme\n\nRussia has allocated over $25m for the next phase of the School Feeding Programme (2025–30) run by the UN World Food Programme in Armenia.\n\nSince 2010, Russia has contributed 43m dollars in total, benefiting over 102,000 schoolchildren, modernising facilities and improving attendance and performance. The UN has praised the programme's success and bilateral cooperation, the report said.\n\nIn the meantime, the Russian House culture centre in Armenia will launch a free four-month robotics course for children and teenagers starting 25 August as part of the Russian Engineering School international educational project. Participants will improve their Russian language skills, learn robotics using unique Russian methods and explore leading Russian universities and scientific achievements, Sputnik Armenia said.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7397350651202815,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Armenia\n*   Gyumri\n*   Moscow\n*   Yerevan\n*   Russia\n*   Karabakh (also referred to as Nagorno-Karabakh)\n*   Syunik (also referred to as Syunik Region)\n*   Zangazur corridor (also referred to as Trump Route, Trump Route for Peace and Prosperity/TRIPP)\n*   Washington\n*   Azerbaijan\n*   United States (also referred to as USA, States)\n*   UK\n*   Turkey\n*   Israel\n*   Iran\n*   Ukraine (implied by \"Ukrainian front\")\n*   Baku\n*   South Caucasus\n*   China\n*   Europe\n*   Mediterranean\n*   Meghri (Armenia)\n*   Naxcivan (Azerbaijan)\n*   Yeraskh (Armenia)\n*   Georgia\n*   Russian House (in Armenia)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-149.42648315429688}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.549703Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dacfGIZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":12644},"candidatesTokenCount":202,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":202}],"promptTokenCount":2868,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":2868}],"thoughtsTokenCount":3656,"totalTokenCount":6726,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:56.906753+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Yerevan has once again ruled out any transport arrangement that would compromise Armenia's territorial integrity or sovereignty.\n\n\"Armenia has never discussed and will not discuss the kinds of options of transport links that would be incompatible with its own territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction,\" Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's spokesperson Nazeli Baghdasaryan said on Facebook. She made the comments in response to what she described as \"confusion\" in the media about the matter.\n\n\"It is evident that there is some confusion in the Armenian media about Armenia's position regarding the unblocking of regional transport links, and the media outlets see some contradictions in the statements of Armenian officials. To some extent, this is understandable, because the topic has numerous nuances, which sometimes get more complicated with the use of certain wordings, such as renting out, lease, building lease, outsourcing. Certainly, each of the wordings can have different meanings depending on what specifically it pertains to.\n\n\"In order to make the issue easier for the esteemed representatives of the press, I would like to once again underscore that the Republic of Armenia has never discussed, is not discussing and will not discuss the kinds of options of transport links passing through its own territory that would be incompatible with the territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Republic of Armenia.\n\n\"And furthermore, as part of its territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction, the Republic of Armenia is not only discussing various formulas of utilising regional transport routes, but is also eager to reach an agreement around any of the formulas,\" Baghdasaryan said.\n\n\"Armenia's territorial integrity, sovereignty and jurisdiction cannot be outsourced. The business management of a railway, pipeline [or] power transmission lines can be [outsourced]. Incidentally, the maintenance and management of roads in Armenia has always been outsourced to private companies. Who manages [the roads] and with what quality is another matter. But this has nothing to do with the topic discussed,\" Baghdasaryan added.\n\nArmenia to temporarily shelter 'endangered' Palestinian cultural heritage\n\nArmenia will temporarily house elements of \"endangered Palestinian cultural heritage\" at the Matenadaran Institute of Ancient Manuscripts in Yerevan as part of an agreement between Armenia and the Palestinians, News.am reported.\n\nIt was quoting a statement made by Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Vahan Kostanyan at the high-level UN conference on the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, in New York. In his speech, Kostanyan reaffirmed Armenia's commitment to the two-state solution, stating that \"lasting peace and stability are only possible through the existence of two neighbouring independent states\".\n\nKostanyan also welcomed France's intention to recognise \"Palestine\" and the UK's intention to follow suit, noting Armenia's pride in having hosted a meeting between the French and Palestinian foreign ministers during the Yerevan Dialogue diplomatic conference earlier in 2025.\n\nDespite limited resources, he said, Armenia has made consistent efforts to support the Palestinian people - including sending humanitarian aid to Gaza and backing the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\n\nKostanyan emphasised the importance of protecting Christian communities and heritage in both states, noting that Armenia is particularly concerned about preserving holy sites in the \"Holy Land\".\n\n\"Armenia hopes that the historic status quo governing the holy sites in Jerusalem will be fully upheld,\" he said, calling it \"a cornerstone of interfaith solidarity and peaceful coexistence\".\n\nRed Cross to stop visiting Armenian detainees in Baku\n\nThe families of Armenians held in Baku have been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that it will no longer be able to visit the detainees, Azatutyun.am, the Armenian service of Radio Liberty, has reported.\n\nThis news has caused serious concern among the detainees' relatives, as the ICRC was the only independent international organisation able to access the detained Armenians, monitor their conditions and health, provide necessary clothing and hygiene supplies, and facilitate video calls with family members, the report said.\n\nOne relative told Azatutyun that the ICRC was \"the last hope\" for the families and the detainees. \"The only means was the Red Cross, which connected families and brought some light to these people's lives. And now this has been cut off too,\" the person said.\n\nZara Amatuni, the head of Communication for the ICRC delegation in Armenia, told Azatutyun that the last visit to the Armenians took place in June, and there have been no visits in July. According to Amatuni, the ICRC's Baku office will soon suspend operation at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities.\n\n\"Naturally, this situation is causing disruptions to our normal work process,\" she said.\n\nOfficial data from Azerbaijan indicate that 23 Armenians are currently held in Baku prisons. Their only contact with relatives now is through phone calls arranged by the Azerbaijani authorities.\n\nThe pro-opposition Joghovurd daily cited the families of the detainees said that Azerbaijan has now fully prohibited visits to both civilian and military and political Armenian captives. Previously, limited contact was allowed once a month via video calls, but even that has been cut off, the report said.\n\nThe daily added that Baku is unwilling to make concessions, while the peace agreement with Baku promised by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan appears increasingly uncertain.\n\nPundit says no unified stance in Iran on 'Zangazur corridor'\n\nExpert on international relations Grigor Balasanyan has told News.am reformist and conservative forces in Iran no longer have a unified position on the issue of the potential so-called Zangazur corridor which is to link mainland Azerbaijan to its Naxcivan exclave via southern Armenia along the Iranian border.\n\nIran has long opposed the Zangazur corridor project which it says it fears would cut off its access to Armenia.\n\nThe expert noted that serious events are unfolding in Iran, where the political elite is currently divided into two factions. The reformists, led by President Massoud Pezeshkian, are no longer strongly opposed to the opening of the corridor.\n\n\"In fact, Pezeshkian recently gave an interview in which he made a controversial statement, saying that issues related to restoring routes along Iran's north-western border are trivial and not worth worrying about. In other words, the Iranian president considers the opening of the 'Zangazur corridor' an insignificant matter,\" Balasanyan said, noting that an opposite stance is held by the team of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who sharply criticise Pezeshkian, warning of destructive consequences for Iran from the corridor's opening.\n\nThe expert also said that Pezeshkian's visit to Azerbaijan's Karabakh in July for a summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation was also symbolic following the 12-day Iran-Israel war. \"Knowing well that Iranian territory is constantly shelled from Azerbaijan, choosing to attend the meeting implies agreement with everything happening against your [Pezeshkian's] state,\" the expert said.\n\nArmenian president visits border checkpoint, communities near Iran\n\nAs part of his visit to Armenia's southern Syunik Province, Armenia's ceremonial President Vahagn Khachaturyan has toured the Meghri customs checkpoint at the border with Iran, where he was briefed by Deputy Head of the State Revenue Committee Karen Tamazyan on current operations and plans for a new facility at the checkpoint to boost transport links. The new facility will be ready in 2026, Tamazyan said.\n\nKhachaturyan referred to the government's Crossroads of Peace initiative, expressing concern that the planned facility may not be adequate to support the project's full implementation or to ensure reliable transport connectivity along the Middle Corridor.\n\nThe president also visited the communities of Chakaten and Nerkin Hand, where he conversed with residents, discussed local issues and inquired about ongoing and planned government programmes in border areas. Khachaturyan visited a tunnel under construction as part of the North-South Road Corridor Project, where he observed the progress of ongoing construction work.\n\nAlso, Khachaturyan visited a military unit, reviewed living conditions and awarded several soldiers for their exemplary service.\n\nArmenia-China defence relations\n\nArmenian Armed Forces General Staff Chief Edvard Asryan has attended an event at the Chinese embassy marking the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army, Armenpress has reported.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Asryan stated that defence cooperation between two countries, including between the defence ministries, has developed successfully in recent years. He noted that China is currently one of Armenia's key international partners, and further development of bilateral cooperation is among the priorities of Armenia's foreign policy.\n\n\"Armenia-China relations are based on mutual respect, a high level of political dialogue and mutual understanding. Armenia is actively participating in the Belt and Road initiative proposed by the Chinese president, which aligns with Armenia's Crossroads of Peace project,\" Asryan said.\n\nHe said the Armenian government places strong emphasis on developing cooperation with China in the defence sector.\n\nIn this context, he highlighted that in 2023 and 2024, Armenian Defence Minister Suren Papikyan took part in the 10th and 11th Xiangshan international security forums held in Beijing to have productive meetings that helped further strengthen and expand bilateral cooperation.\n\nAsryan added that annual bilateral cooperation programmes include delegation exchanges and expert-level working meetings across key areas of mutual interest. He said Armenia-China relations are currently at a high level, and further development is planned in several key areas.\n\nIn the field of military science, close relations have been established between the Academy of Military Sciences of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Armenia's Vazgen Sargsyan Military University of the Ministry of Defence and National Defence Research University.\n\nChinese ambassador to Armenia Li Songwei said that China's global projects, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, aim to support development, and that countries like Armenia have shown interest and support.\n\nPraising the steady development of relations between Armenia and China over the past 33 years, the diplomat said both nations respect each other's sovereignty and support one another on key national issues.\n\nHe confirmed that China will support Armenia's bid to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation during its chairmanship this year. Li added that Beijing is ready to deepen practical cooperation and strengthen peace and stability in the region.\n\nIn July, Armenia announced it seeks to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as part of its strategy to pursue a balanced foreign policy. Prime Minister Pashinyan dismissed speculations that its possible SCO membership contradicts Armenia's position on the Moscow-led military alliance CSTO, noting that several countries are members of both organisations.\n\nPremier's falling approval rating reportedly sparks search for new political challenges\n\nPrime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's approval rating has dropped to 13%, but Armenia's traditional opposition forces have failed to gain ground, Past daily has said. The newspaper argued that Pashinyan is now looking for a \"dangerous opponent\" among other forces that are capable of gaining the trust of Armenian society which is disappointed both with the ruling \"velvet\" government and former authorities.\n\nAmong those Pashinyan reportedly viewed as potential threats were the Armenian Apostolic Church and influential philanthropists, Past said. It said that Pashinyan deliberately provoked conflict with the Church in an effort to weaken it and reshape it to make it fit his \"velvet revolution\" narrative.\n\nThe arrest of influential businessman Samvel Karapetyan and his announcement to form a new political party marked a critical turning point, signaling a potential new challenge to Prime Minister Pashinyan's power, the daily said. It said that Karapetyan approaches politics as business and suggests that this approach manifests in his \"in our own way\" statement declared by Karapetyan's team, which has greatly unsettled the authorities.

Two U.S. officials said the package also includes an older version of the Army's longer-range missile systems known as ATACMS, which can travel 100 miles.\n\nIt is a stopgap measure at best, the officials said, but Ukraine is in dire need of air defense systems in particular, as Russia has continued its bombardment of towns particularly in the east.\n\nThe makeshift solution would keep advancing Russian troops at bay for only a few weeks, one official said.\n\nAnnouncing the aid package at the White House, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that ''Ukrainian troops have fought bravely, are fighting bravely throughout this war, but they are now forced to ration their ammunition under pressure on multiple fronts.''\n\nHe said the new package would ''keep Ukraine's guns firing for a period, but only a short period.'' Mr. Sullivan called for Congress to pass a new Ukraine aid bill ''as soon as possible.''\n\nHe said that Ukraine desperately needed the assistance to hold the line against Russian attacks, but that ''it goes without saying this package does not displace and should not delay the critical need to pass the bipartisan national security bill.''\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his overnight address, thanked ''the United States and all Americans who value freedom'' for their support of his country.\n\nThe Senate passed an emergency aid bill including $60.1 billion for Ukraine. But the measure faces an uncertain fate in the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders have refused to put the measure to a vote. While congressional officials say there is a critical mass of support for continuing to arm Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, the Republican Party is increasingly turning away from its traditional hawkish posture and belief in projecting American power and democratic principles around the world.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican of Louisiana who has opposed aiding Ukraine, must navigate a handful of ultraconservative lawmakers who have said they will move to oust him if he allows a vote on Ukraine aid without stringent immigration measures attached.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, urged Mr. Johnson to hold a vote on the Ukraine aid package.\n\n''I want to encourage the speaker again to allow a vote,'' he said.\n\nFor President Biden, who has led the way in calling for the West to stand up for Ukraine against Russia's invasion and occupation, the issue has become an embarrassing one on the international stage.\n\nThe American political paralysis has led, Pentagon officials said, to critical shortages on the battlefields of Ukraine. As each day goes by without a fresh supply of munitions and artillery, and Ukrainian crews ration the shells they have, morale suffers.\n\n''When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back; that's costing terrain,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''It's costing lives and it's costing us, the United States and the NATO alliance, strategically.''\n\nSince Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has sent more than $75 billion in cash and equipment to the country for its defense. Most of the aid has gone to Ukraine's military operations, keeping its government running and addressing its humanitarian needs.\n\nThe money ran out in December, and Mr. Biden asked Congress for the authority to begin a new infusion of cash and equipment that only it can approve. But many Republicans object to pouring more taxpayer dollars into the conflict.\n\nSenior intelligence officials warned on Monday that without additional American aid, Ukraine faced the prospect of continued battlefield losses as Russia uses a network of arms suppliers and increases its supply of technology from China.\n\nIn public testimony during the annual survey of worldwide threats facing the United States, the officials told Congress that any continued delay of U.S. aid would lead to additional territorial gains by Russia over the next year, the consequences of which would be felt in Europe and in the Pacific.\n\nOn Tuesday, Denmark also announced a new $340 million military aid package for Ukraine.\n\nConstant Méheut contributed reporting.\n\nConstant Méheut contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.027922257133152,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":982,"startIndex":609,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":2535,"startIndex":2312,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":3492,"startIndex":2983,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":3937,"startIndex":3711,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":4814,"startIndex":4580,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":5634,"startIndex":5348,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":6015,"startIndex":5780,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"},{"endIndex":6643,"startIndex":6351,"uri":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/03/13/world/politics/us-ukraine-weapons-plan/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   United States (U.S., American)\n*   White House\n*   east (referring to eastern Ukraine)\n*   Louisiana\n*   Kentucky\n*   The West (geopolitical region)\n*   Pentagon\n*   China\n*   Europe\n*   Pacific (referring to the Pacific region)\n*   Denmark"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-94.56884765625}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.168296Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94daeiiCuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3814},"candidatesTokenCount":92,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":92}],"promptTokenCount":887,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":887}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1920,"totalTokenCount":2899,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:52.460698+00:00"}

The editorial said: \"People are still not satisfied with the health facilities in Jammu and Kashmir. The government has been engaged in providing modern facilities to government hospitals and other health centres for the past several years. Despite this, the misfortune is that the patients are not satisfied with the behaviour of the doctors and other staff there. There is no one to take care of patients who have no influence in these hospitals. Hospitals in rural areas have become mere referral centres for patients. Almost every patient who comes here is referred to a big hospital. Rather, it has been seen many times that patients are advised to go to private hospitals. The strange thing is that it is not possible to get treatment without a recommendation in two big hospitals of Kashmir. Perhaps being aware of this, the lieutenant governor has urged that health facilities should be provided equally to every citizen and there should be no discrimination. It is difficult to say whether this advice will be implemented in government hospitals. People sitting in such hospitals have proved to be very fearless and anti-public. They do not have any kind relationship with the patients. Rather, they have become accustomed to behaving very rudely with poor patients. Fearing them, people prefer to take their patients to hospitals outside Kashmir. Hundreds of patients go to Chandigarh, Amritsar, Delhi and even Faridabad for treatment. Such patients openly appreciate the kindness of the doctors and the passion of the other staff. Patients from there advise other people that it is better to spend lakhs of rupees outside than to spend a single rupee in hospitals in Kashmir. The only reason for this is not the professional ability of the doctors there, but their compassionate attitude.\" [Online, Approximate Words: 700]\n\n[Urdu-language Daily Chattan is a pro-Kashmir separatist, pro-militant daily that is popular in the northern part of Indian-administered Kashmir.

The editorial said: \"The Election Commission is taking steps to ensure free, fair, transparent and terror-free polling and for this, the public is being asked to vote in maximum numbers in the parliamentary elections. It is noteworthy that the commission has declared most of the polling stations in Jammu and Kashmir as 'dangerous' and the authorities have been asked to ensure that no law-and-order problem arises there. Due to terrorism, the voter turnout has been very low, and it has not been recorded more than 20-30% in Kashmir. On the contrary, the voter turnover in Jammu has always been between 60-70%. The chief electoral officer (CEO) said more parts of the Kashmir region have been declared unsafe after a recent exercise by the authorities. Therefore, the police have been asked to increase patrolling, initiate cordon and search operations, strengthen checkpoints, hold regular meetings of officers and collaborate with other security agencies to ensure peaceful elections. The CEO said the Election Commission has done away with the terms highly sensitive, sensitive and normal to ensure better turnout. He said that to prevent the activities of terrorists, anti-national elements and miscreants in vulnerable areas and critical polling stations, they have adopted a new procedure to ensure a healthy turnout.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Nadia Mirza remarked the government seems to be unsure about whether it would be able to complete its term. She noted Rana Sanaullah, a senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician, recently commented that appointment of Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi is a \"guarantee for the government's survival\".\n\nMirza noted it is for the first time in the history of Pakistan that stability and sustainability of a newly formed government are said to be dependent on the appointment of certain personalities as finance and interior ministers. She asked senior journalist Amir Zia to comment on the situation. Zia said the [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif-led government apparently seems quite strong but not only its opponents, but also the people inside the government keep asking whether it would be able to complete its tenure. He added the present government represents \"unity in diversity\" but there are \"competing interests\" at work against each other within it.\n\nZia criticised a statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs Ishaq Dar that trade relations with India should be restored and commented there are \"no takers of peace in India\" and the election campaign there is based on an \"anti-Pakistan\" sentiment. He added Pakistan's \"stated stance\" is that talks with India are not possible till the latter annuls its steps taken on 5 August 2019 regarding the status of Kashmir.\n\nZia was of the view that the finance minister should be empowered, but \"unfortunately whenever a technocrat is appointed to the position, he does not get political support\". He mentioned Aurangzeb has close links with the Sharif family, yet he is \"not being fully trusted\". He insisted Dar should have nothing to do with the finance ministry, and if Aurangzeb is not allowed to work freely, it would be unfair to Pakistan.\n\nTalking about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's future in politics, Zia said his politics suffered a \"setback\" in the 8 February elections and it is to be seen whether his daughter and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would be able to revive the politics launched by him and win the power tussle within the Sharif family. He claimed Maryam Nawaz's actions are being \"overly publicised\".\n\nSpeaking about the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Zia said the party is facing \"very complex problems\" but it does not look like the government can take advantage of the issues within the party.\n\nPolitics within PTI\n\nMirza said the PTI is facing internal issues because Imran Khan (PTI founder) is in jail and there are restrictions on the party's activities. She noted on 23 March, PTI politician Sher Afzal Marwat revealed that dissidents in his party have formed a forward group in the Punjab Assembly, but several other party members have denied the reports of division within the PTI.\n\nMirza contacted Marwat and asked him whether he stands firm on his statement or will he take a U-turn. Marwat commented he never takes a U-turn on his statements. He claimed his statement was based on information shared by several \"responsible members\" in a party meeting and statement of the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly. He was of the view that it would be good if PTI politicians in the parliamentary party have control over the members of the assemblies.\n\nMarwat emphasised the PTI should focus on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab Assembly during the Senate (upper house of the parliament) elections because many \"powerful people\" would be contesting as independent candidates. He said the PTI should try to win at least nine Senate seats from KP and two from Punjab.\n\nEconomy\n\nMirza asked economist Shahid Hasan Siddiqui whether the new finance minister would be able to improve Pakistan's economy. Siddiqui said it is for sure that loans would be granted to Pakistan but the economy would further weaken. He added if the same policies continue after the 24th International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, Pakistan would have to go into a 25th programme as well because there is a \"nexus of Pakistani and foreign elite\" who want these policies to continue. He was of the view that the United States (US) wants Pakistan to remain in the IMF programme for its political interests and the Pakistani elite want to continue the IMF programme to \"please the US\" and increase the tax burden on people under the cover of the IMF. He noted the government has not offered any new suggestions since 2001 for expanding the tax net and noted the tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has declined in the last few years.\n\nSource: Dawn News TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1700 GMT 24 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9594320569719587,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Pakistan\n*   India\n*   Kashmir\n*   Punjab\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)\n*   United States (US)\n*   Karachi"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-40.296146392822266}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.577370Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4dadqeI8K2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3893},"candidatesTokenCount":42,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":42}],"promptTokenCount":976,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":976}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1475,"totalTokenCount":2493,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.285883+00:00"}

But the problem [presumably refers to the airstrikes and the&#160;retaliatory attacks by the Taliban] was between the Pakistani military and military forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [the Taliban de facto government],\" Khorasan added.\n\nHe further said: \"The Pakistani military committed a stupid act by hitting civilian targets. And they are executing the US's and West's ominous projects in the name of [fighting] terrorism... Mujahideen [Taliban fighters] and border units have given proper response [the retaliatory attacks] to their stupid action&#8230; Meanwhile, a delegation from Pakistan has arrived in Afghanistan to improve the relations, which is a normal process.\"\n\nKhorasani said that although the Taliban administration has been seeking to maintain good relations with all neighbouring countries, neighbours have made \"unfounded\" allegations and Pakistan, which he said was not independent, implements the \"West's projects\".&#160;\n\nRejecting the allegations that the Taliban backs and shelters militants who are hostile to Islamabad, he said: \"It is a baseless allegation. There is no truth in it at all. I have always said in discussions that if Pakistani authorities have sufficient evidence to prove the presence of hideouts and bases of their opponents in the territory of Afghanistan, why have they not shared them with media outlets, people and the international community? It is a period of technology. They can bomb civilian houses, but why do they not video record the basses and share the clips with the Islamic Emirate and the international community? So, it is a baseless claim.\"\n\nConcluding, Khorasani warned of serious consequences if Pakistan continues to carry out airstrikes or interfere in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan.\n\nPro-Taliban political commentator Hatif Mukhtar, who joined the debate at the TV studio in Kabul, insisted that Pakistan should alter its strategy and should not interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.&#160;\n\n\"Pakistan should understand that Afghanistan is not its colony. It is a free and independent country. Pakistan does not have the right to interfere in our domestic affairs. On the other hand, we interact with Pakistan in line with our national interests,\" he said.\n\n\"In the current sensitive, difficult and historical situation, our national interests suggest that we should have good relations with Pakistan. Pakistan should also have good relations with us. It is Pakistan which should pave the way for this to happen. As far as we are concerned, we do not interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs in any circumstances.&#160;The TTP&#160;is an internal issue of Pakistan,\" the pro-Taliban commentator said.\n\nWhen asked what is the solution to address the problems between the two countries, Mukhtar said: \"Pakistan can make investments in Afghanistan. As a brotherly and friendly country, Pakistan should not interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Pakistan should resolve the issue of TTP and Baluchis by themselves. We will never interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has adopted a balanced, impartial and strategic policy under which we want to be friends with Pakistan. We want to have relations with Pakistan.\"\n\nSource: Ariana News TV, Kabul, in Dari and Pashto 1400 GMT 26 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.2392451763153076,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Kabul\n*   Islamabad\n*   Afghanistan\n*   Pakistan\n*   Eastern Afghanistan"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-71.65584564208984}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.667533Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4daY3fKJe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3358},"candidatesTokenCount":32,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":32}],"promptTokenCount":812,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":812}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1360,"totalTokenCount":2204,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.742342+00:00"}

As a result, experts expect an \"extremely high level of support\" for incumbent President Vladimir Putin. \"The election campaigning was held without excessive information and administrative pressure. On the contrary, constant attempts to rock the boat via social networks had the opposite effect,\" pundit Alexander Asafov, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, said. According to him, the high voter turnout stemmed from the proper arrangement of voting and few instances of election violations and ballot stuffing. The population's trust in the federal authorities has considerably grown over the past five years thanks to both unprecedented support measures and the authorities' care for local residents, the expert said.\n\nPolitical analyst Mikhail Kuznetsov attributed the high voter turnout to the successes of the socioeconomic development in the district in recent years, whereas pundit Yevgeny Chadayev emphasised Far Easterners' patriotic feelings that came to the fore in decision-making. \"In a situation of the special military operation [the war on Ukraine], external challenges and the sanctions pressure on Russia new political views have formed.

You kept on fighting.” Mr. Faye told supporters in Dakar on Thursday evening. “Today we are ready to join you in the same fight.”\n\nThe release is the latest in a series of unexpected moves by the incumbent president, Macky Sall, who cited allegations of corruption when he announced last month that he was canceling the election. Facing a backlash, he reversed course and set the election for Sunday, March 24 — just nine days before his term ends.\n\nAfter years of hinting that he might run again, Mr. Sall finally confirmed last July that he would step down after his two terms were up.\n\nSenegal, a coastal West African nation of 17 million people, is seen as a bastion of democracy relative to some of its West African neighbors, which are ruled by military juntas following a spate of coups in recent years.\n\nMr. Sonko was ineligible to run in the upcoming election because he was convicted last June of corrupting a minor and sentenced to two years in prison. Mr. Faye was running from jail, where he was awaiting trial on defamation charges and contempt of court, after he accused magistrates of persecuting Mr. Sonko to serve Mr. Sall’s interests in a social media post last year.\n\nCampaigning has started for the election. Mr. Sall’s chosen successor, the former prime minister Amadou Ba, has held rallies that have been poorly attended and have garnered little attention.\n\nAlioune Tine, an expert on human rights in West Africa, said that the imprisonment of Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye had increased their cachet, especially for Mr. Faye, who was a little-known figure before he was named Mr. Sonko’s replacement for the election.\n\n“When you throw leaders in jail, you turn them into heroes,” said Mr. Tine, the founder of the AfrikaJom Center, a research organization in Dakar.\n\nAs Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye paraded in Dakar’s downtown on Thursday evening, it was Mr. Sonko’s name that supporters chanted. But Mr. Sonko kept a low profile while Mr. Faye addressed the crowds with a microphone, standing in a car, a scarf in the colors of the Senegalese flag around his neck.\n\n“Sonko will play a central role in the campaign, but the key challenge for him will be not to overshadow Faye too much, so Faye can win,” Mr. Tine added.\n\nMr. Sonko seemed intent on staying in the background on Friday. Briefing reporters, Mr. Sonko said that the government had spoken to him about postponing the election again so that he could run. But, Mr. Sonko said, he was happy for Mr. Faye to be the candidate.\n\n“It’s not about me, it’s about the party,” he said. “Diomaye Faye has never made a decision without asking me.”\n\nNineteen candidates in all are on the ballot for the election in Senegal, one of the few countries in the region that has never endured military rule. In recent years, however, Mr. Sall’s government repeatedly cut off access to the internet and forbade demonstrations as Mr. Sonko rose to fame.\n\nDozens of protesters have been killed during anti-government riots, many by live ammunition that human rights groups said was fired by the country’s security forces.\n\nMr. Sonko is a charismatic yet divisive figure who was tried on charges of raping an employee of a massage parlor. He was acquitted of rape but sentenced last year to two years in prison for “corruption of youth” because the employee was under 21.\n\nMr. Sall signed an amnesty law earlier this month that eventually led to the release of Mr. Faye and Mr. Sonko. But Mr. Sonko’s role in both the upcoming election and the country’s political future remains unclear.\n\nA former tax inspector and currently the mayor of the southern town of Ziguinchor, Mr. Sonko has vowed to rid Senegal of corruption, appealing to young Senegalese voters — though he has not made clear how he plans to execute his promises of sweeping change.\n\n“Sonko is the person Senegal needs,” said Serge Goudiaby Atepa, a well-known Senegalese architect and the head of Senegal’s main lobby of business leaders.\n\nMr. Atepa also praised Mr. Sall for releasing Mr. Sonko, who for years was his main political foe. “The crowds we saw on the streets last night prove that it was the right thing to do,” he said.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4403271993001303,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Dakar\n*   Senegal\n*   West Africa\n*   Ziguinchor"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-43.209815979003906}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.496214Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dadakHsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3669},"candidatesTokenCount":30,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":30}],"promptTokenCount":1009,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1009}],"thoughtsTokenCount":718,"totalTokenCount":1757,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.214567+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Ahead of the meeting, Vladimir Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Southern Federal District Vladimir Ustinov and Krasnodar Territory Governor Veniamin Kondratyev inspected the personnel training facility. While in one of the classrooms, the President was shown aircraft simulators in action. School Head Anatoly Yudin provided explanations.\n\nEstablished in 1938, the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School now trains crews for operational-tactical, long-range, military-transport and naval aviation units. Since September 2017, the education institution has been training female students.\n\n* * *\n\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin: To be honest, our meeting is taking place in an unusual format. We are meeting with young female pilots in the run-up to March 8.\n\nI would like to congratulate all of you on the upcoming holiday. This is a good and very positive spring holiday. I wish you every success in your careers, a happy family life and marital bliss. I am confident that you will accomplish everything because you are strong-willed people. You are acting purposefully and steering towards your goals.\n\nMr Shoigu told me how the first cadets enrolled here. I do not know whether this young woman is present here or not. A prospective cadet who failed to enrol pitched up a tent in front of the gate. Indeed, this attitude towards life and her future career is worth a lot. I am confident that, given such an attitude, you will accomplish everything. This is the first thing.\n\nSecond, female professionals achieve results in many fields. This is hardly surprising because, apart from their impressive training levels, women meticulously analyse the smallest details linked with their career. Young women display a highly responsible attitude towards the work with which they have been entrusted. On the whole, this allows them to achieve good results.\n\nI am confident that you will also attain results, all the more so as you have graduated from a school that is closely linked with Russia and our Armed Forces. Suffice it to recall the Great Patriotic War. Your school's graduates served as prototypes for many books, artistic works, films and even an opera. Many graduates became Heroes of the Soviet Union, Heroes of Russia and heroes of other countries where our pilots were actively involved in hostilities.\n\nThey destroyed literally thousands of enemy tanks, as well as aircraft and artillery crews. Your school's graduates rammed enemy planes on 20 occasions during the Great Patriotic War. This is a heroic educational institution. I am confident that you will also continue the wonderful traditions of this pilot training school.\n\nOf course, the uninitiated tend to link aviation with romantic blue skies. However, you have probably felt that there is something more to it, apart from the romance. Well, of course, it is impossible to do without the omnipresent romance here. And now ... Is your name Katya? Am I right?\n\nYekaterina Battalova: Guards Lieutenant Battalova.\n\nVladimir Putin: She was now operating the controls, and we could hear that she was quite composed. She is made for this job. She is enjoying her work, and she is quite enthusiastic about her future lifetime career, to which all of you have decided to devote your lives.\n\nWhat am I trying to say? Quite possibly, elements of a romantic blue sky are present here. However, this career requires high standards of professional training and a serious attitude towards work. This is a complicated sphere: one should have a good knowledge of equipment and be able to operate it. This amounts to large-scale and responsible work. I want to wish you all the best.\n\nOur women and quite young girls currently serve in the special military operation zone. They worthily serve the Motherland in various fields everywhere.\n\nOnce again, I congratulate you on the upcoming holiday, and I wish you all the best.\n\nI am at your service, if there is anything that you would like to discuss, please do.\n\nVioletta Kasilovich: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief.\n\nBefore I ask my question, let me take this opportunity to thank you and the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defence for giving us, ordinary girls, the opportunity to become military pilots of the Russian Aerospace Forces.\n\nThe year 2023 was particularly important for us. The most memorable event for us is graduation from the Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School. What was the most memorable event in 2023 for you?\n\nVladimir Putin: You know, my life consists of an endless number of events and activities. Sometimes I compare it to a waterfall: standing under a waterfall, it pours constantly.\n\nEven when I am with my loved ones, I try not to show any signs of stress, and, on the contrary, I pretend that everything is fine, we are quite at ease and having a rest. But I know that in five minutes I will get a phone call from someone, in ten minutes I will have to call someone else, and within 30 minutes there will be some event and I'll have to understand what happened and, if necessary, react to it somehow or adjust something. So, it's just a series of events.\n\nBut, of course, like for the country as a whole, for me and for you, I think, all the brightest, most significant things happened on the battlefield - in the zone of the special military operation. Then, of course, there are a lot of issues related to the economy, to maintaining it, its development, to ensuring a rate of economic growth. This is the foundation that everything is built on, our whole life - both our social life and our military successes are based on benchmarks in the economy, in the real sector of industry. So, everything is basically there.\n\nThe most vivid events are, of course, meetings with our men, or with our women, our girls who serve in the special military operation, or with members of their families. Frankly, I try not to show emotion, but still, these events, these meetings have the brightest emotional colouring. So everything is connected with these events, just like for you, just like for the overwhelming majority of our citizens.\n\nYelizaveta Fedotova: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, may I ask you a question? Lieutenant Fedotova.\n\nYou have flown and even personally piloted many types of aircraft, and recently you flew on a Tu-160M &Atilde;&cent;??&Atilde;&cent;??strategic missile carrier. Please tell us about this experience. Do you have any plans to master other modern planes?\n\nVladimir Putin: Just now I flew a simulator with the comrade lieutenant - this is also a definite experience. But as for piloting... You know, I really piloted a glider, flew with cranes - if you remember, it was several years ago. But that was not a simulator, I actually piloted it, it's true.\n\nBut I also had to train then, because the sky is a serious business. Who else but you knows this? We flew low, I also flew low - about 400 metres. As soon as the wind blows, it shakes. These are not simulators, 400 metres is a bit high. That is when I piloted.\n\nAnd other planes I flew on were a Su-25 attack plane, then a Su-27 fighter, a Tu-160, and a Be-200 when we were putting out fires. Of course, I did not pilot anything. However, it was all useful and interesting, and I needed to understand what it was all about. You always need to understand what a thing is, touch it with your hands, then you will better understand what is happening.\n\nI do not mean to offend anyone, but I think that the hardest type of service is piloting an attack plane. G force! I just cannot understand how these guys control the plane, because up and down, strikes are carried out visually, when they see the target, they descend sharply, and then rise just as sharply. The G force is so great that only the hands and fingers move effectively. I cannot understand how they fly the plane.\n\nThe only so-called piloting element was on the Su-27, when the commander suggested that I perform a \"roll.\" I did this myself. He said: \"I am delegating you the controls. Be smooth, no sudden movements, move the controls to the right, and we will do a roll.\" I did it myself, it's true. We rolled easily, the plane is very powerful. But he said just that: \"The plane is powerful, very responsive, manoeuvrable, take your time with it.\" So I did it myself.\n\nIn 2005, we experienced a remarkable five-hour flight on the Tu-160, which was an absolute delight. The trip was a unique experience, particularly during the imperceptible transition to supersonic speed. The click associated with this shift is inaudible on the plane but audible on the ground.\n\nThe last flight [on the Tu-160M] was not originally planned because the Minister [of Defence Sergei Shoigu] said that we cannot fly because the machine had not yet been officially accepted, a sentiment echoed by the industry. However, during our visit to the enterprise [Gorbunov Kazan Aircraft Production Association] and a tour around it, the aircraft's commander assured me, \"Mr President, we are ready. We can be in the air in two hours. I suggest you give it a try.\" I agreed, proposing to schedule it for the next day due to prior commitments. The commander responded, \"We will be ready.\" And so, we boarded and took to the skies.\n\nIt was interesting to see the transformation the aircraft has undergone since my last flight in 2005. The changes were extensive: it is practically a new machine. The crew told me about the numerous updates, emphasising that nearly everything, including the avionics, had been revamped. The commander encouraged me to turn on the engines, press some buttons, and so on. It was very enlightening to get some hands-on experience.\n\nThis modernisation was carried out at the initiative of the Minister of Defence. While various proposals were considered, with some suggesting closing this chapter and opening an entirely new one, it became evident that such a shift would likely result in a gap in our access to combat-ready strategic aviation.\n\nI think we made the right decision, and the Minister had a good suggestion. We actually created a new aircraft that is unparalleled globally: a supersonic machine operating at unprecedented speeds. This strategic aircraft is equipped to carry nuclear weapons, thereby fortifying our nuclear triad.\n\nOne more thing: I attempted to operate a simulator myself. When the lieutenant suggested I take control, I declined, saying that she would do much better. Instead, I decided to try my hand at piloting a helicopter. I found it to be the most challenging type of flying. Just a millimeter of difference in the control can send it veering in different directions, making it tricky to pinpoint the exact landing spot. I think helicopters are the most difficult to pilot.\n\nExcept, of course, what I really piloted when flying with the cranes. But this was a real situation. This is a simulator, but it's a complicated job. This is a very complicated job where every millimeter matters. This is why army aviation, which is performing very serious missions today that we badly need on the battlefield, naturally deserves the highest praise and respect. That probably takes care of my entire aviation history.\n\nBut having felt all this and flown various aircraft, I might say that it seems like a man's job, although it is certainly accessible to girls and women. In general, I believe there are no jobs that women shouldn't do and can't achieve success with. Young women work and achieve success everywhere in our country. True, there have been no women yet in maritime aviation, torpedo or missile aviation. After all, these jobs are particularly risky, and I think we should protect young women.\n\nGo ahead, please.\n\nYana Vasina: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, permission to speak please. I am Lieutenant Vasina.\n\nRussia has been and remains a great aviation power. Starting from the time of Captain Nesterov and Valery Chkalov and up to this day, military pilots have been glorifying our Motherland through their courage and bravery. However, they take their first steps to the skies within the walls of a flight school. As a pilot, I would like to know what you think about pilot training and the future of aviation training.\n\nVladimir Putin: It is difficult for me to give my advice. But there is one thing I know for sure, and we discussed this with the Defence Ministry officials - we need modern, effective simulators. And, of course, we need instructors that can do this job.\n\nAs I understand it, we do not have problems with simulator availability today, but if we have a problem, we'll resolve it. At any rate, we have everything we need for high quality simulators to be available. I believe we have even surpassed our competitors with some simulators - ours are very effective.\n\nAnd what do you do now, after graduation?\n\nYana Vasina: I serve on Tu-154 in Khabarovsk in the Far East.\n\nVladimir Putin: When you trained as a pilot, what did you think should have been added to your training?\n\nYana Vasina: Certainly, a simulator. This is an essential part of flight training now. It is possible to master flying without it, but it makes the process much easier.\n\nVladimir Putin: Did you learn to fly without a simulator?\n\nYana Vasina: I haven't yet flown a Tu-154 simulator.\n\nVladimir Putin: You mean specifically a Tu-154 simulator. I see. In this case, Mr Shoigu, we need to have simulators for all aircraft models for young women and men to learn on in the future.\n\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu: Mr President, the Tu-154 has been out of production for many years.\n\nVladimir Putin: Yes, I see. I am also referring to other aircraft.\n\nSergei Shoigu: You are correct about other aircraft. We must provide simulators for Tu-214s. We have aircraft of this class. Under your instructions, we are beginning to manufacture the Tu-96 again, and we need simulators for those as well. So our plan will be as follows - every consignment of aircraft, especially training planes, will include simulators in the contract.\n\nVladimir Putin: Let us do it without fail, it must be included in the state defence order. This is very important. Comrade Lieutenant asked me how I flew and what I flew. You know, it's important, it really matters. Because on one type of aircraft the pedals move in one way, and on other types of aircraft - in a different way, and this little thing can make a difference when piloting. It does make a difference.\n\nUnfortunately, we have also had mistakes that have led to tragedies, when crews transfer from one type of similar aircraft to another similar aircraft, with systems that operate somewhat differently.\n\nSergei Shoigu: You mean the Yak-40, Yak-42?\n\nVladimir Putin: Yes. That is why it is the right thing to do. We will definitely pay attention to it. You are right.\n\nYana Vasina: Thank you.\n\nVladimir Putin: Yes, please.\n\nDarya Ignasheva: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief.\n\nYou have a very intense working schedule, including constant long flights. Tell me, please, what was your longest flight and how do you manage to keep yourself in such excellent physical shape with such a busy schedule?\n\nVladimir Putin: As for physical fitness, I'll tell you now.\n\nThere were a lot of long, long flights, I don't remember now, but we probably flew to Latin America somewhere, to Mexico - such flights across the ocean. Although, you know, sometimes you can fly from one point in Russia to another faster than across the ocean. It's a big country, the sun never sets on it.\n\nI have to spend a lot of time on the plane. There was a moment, I can't remember exactly when, when I had the impression that I was living on a plane. Yes, yes.\n\nAnd as for staying in shape, I always answer the same, and there is no magic trick. I always say: sport, you should play sports. And I kind of recommend everyone else do it - I recommend everyone plays sports, that's it.\n\nMore to the point, we - if you have been paying attention, we talked about this recently - we will even offer tax deductions for people who regularly participate in sports and meet the Fit for Labour and Defence standards. We will treat them accordingly and help people who take care of their own health.\n\nThis is why sport is really an important way to stay fit. But it goes without saying that I almost never drink alcohol. In fact, I try not to talk about it, although, probably, it should be talked about. But I definitely try not to drink strong drinks.\n\nCold exposure training is a very good procedure: this is important for you as officers. It is true. Hot and cold showers or contrast baths are an effective way to strengthen your health. I remember, you know, when I was still young and lived in Leningrad, we had... we did not even have a bath tub in our communal apartment, but nevertheless I went out into the yard in the winter and wiped myself with snow. I was still a kid.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because you can always find a way to achieve the result you need if you want it. Taking care of your health is important, not only personally, but for the state, so I wish for you to stay healthy, beautiful, and successful.\n\nYes, please.\n\nYulia Zakalyukina: Lieutenant Zakalyukina.\n\nHow would you feel if the captain of Air Force One was a woman?\n\nVladimir Putin: First, I will tell you, I do not select the crews of the aircraft I fly on: this is done by the management of certain aviation services. But they are all distinguished and very experienced people who are dedicated to their work and highly professional; I have no doubts about this. I saw it for myself several times.\n\nIn fact, I believe we should still be guided not by gender, but by business principles when promoting anyone, not only in the military, but in general, in business, anywhere. If a person is competent and has good results in their work, then in no case should they be restricted by gender, like, \"well, a woman does not need to be promoted; she has a family and children, and should have her own life.\" This is wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe it's misguided when it is required to have a certain percentage of women in certain areas: this percent in management, that in parliament, this in local administration, and that one in the Army. People should not be judged in terms of percentages, but by personal and business qualities, by attitude.\n\nSo, if there is a choice, and a woman is successful in an assignment in any place, position, or when moving up the career ladder, of course, there should be no restrictions.\n\nKristina Zhdanova: Permission to speak, Sir?\n\nVladimir Putin: Go ahead, please.\n\nKristina Zhdanova: Lieutenant Zhdanova.\n\nWhat would you wish, on the eve of International Women's Day, for the women that are performing their duties and missions in the special military operation?\n\nVladimir Putin: To return home as soon as possible. I wish them happiness, personal happiness and successes - both combat success and success in their personal lives. I am completely sincere in saying this.\n\nI said I hope for them to return home as soon as possible. But I also know something different about military versus civilians. I will talk about journalists, war correspondents. I saw how they work on the frontline, including young women, performing their journalistic duty. I instructed the top managers of the main channels to withdraw women from the battle field. Why expose women to that risk?\n\nWhat was the result? They took a vacation and stayed there on their own. And, the TV channel managers told me these women were ready to quit their jobs and would go there anyway. The same is true for many other women on combat missions there. I know this - I talked to them. They consider it their duty to be there. They are serving the Motherland; this is their mission, their inner life impulse.\n\nIncidentally, this has been the case in many other periods of our history, including the events in Afghanistan. I know personal examples, women who believed they should be there, and that was that. Nevertheless, I want them to return home to their families and their responsibilities in this area as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, I am certainly most grateful to them for what they are doing, for their attitude towards their service, their work, their service to the Fatherland and I wish them happiness.\n\nMaria Kuzina: Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief!\n\nI am Lieutenant Kuzina.\n\nWe seriously realise the complexity of the military-political situation and today's historical period. Like over 80 years ago, Nazism has raised its head today and is trying to rule the world. Allow me to express support and deep gratitude to you on behalf of the graduates and all military personnel of the Armed Forces.\n\nMr President! You may rely on the Officer Corps of the Russian Federation. We will not let you down.\n\nVladimir Putin: I have no doubt about this. The Russian Officer Corps has always - I want to emphasise the word \"always\" - at all historical turns and all historical stages has demonstrated its highest loyalty to the Motherland, the Fatherland and their duty. Due to these qualities in our officers, Russia has always achieved results and has always emerged victorious from the most difficult trials.\n\nBut when the military is telling me \"We will not let you down,\" I hear \"We will not let our Motherland down.\" As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I would like to reply to you by saying \"Thank you for your service.\"\n\nDo you have any other questions? Are all of you content with the jobs you received upon graduating from flight school? Do you have any other needs or questions? Or would you like to tell me something without the minister and other chiefs in attendance? No? Is everything okay with you?\n\nRemark: Yes, everything is okay.\n\nVladimir Putin: Then, I would like to wish you every success. Happy holiday, happy March 8!\n\nI wish you all the best. Have a good day!\n\nSource: President of the Russian Federation website in English 0800 gmt 8 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1671659851074219,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":848,"startIndex":618,"uri":"http://en.special.kremlin.ru/catalog/keywords/91/events/73618"},{"endIndex":3853,"startIndex":3598,"uri":"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/73618"},{"endIndex":4492,"startIndex":4278,"uri":"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/73618"},{"endIndex":4942,"startIndex":4735,"uri":"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/73618"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Southern Federal District\n*   Krasnodar Territory\n*   Krasnodar Higher Military Aviation School\n*   Russia\n*   Soviet Union\n*   special military operation zone (also referred to as \"battlefield\" or \"battle field\")\n*   Kazan (implied by \"Gorbunov Kazan Aircraft Production Association\")\n*   Khabarovsk\n*   Far East\n*   Leningrad\n*   Afghanistan"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-116.71659851074219}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.436134Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"at4daabPGpe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":18142},"candidatesTokenCount":100,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":100}],"promptTokenCount":4791,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":4791}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1411,"totalTokenCount":6302,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.667757+00:00"}

As competition with China heats up, this dependency is causing alarm, a feeling that helped push the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act across the finish line in 2022.\n\nThe big subsidies pushed by Biden are aimed at restoring American leadership in this critical technology. But it’s not practical to manufacture everything here, given how cheap production has gotten in Asia. Moving production closer and to U.S. allies might be the best we can do. That’s why Biden’s announcement is being celebrated in Costa Rica, the Central American country that is home to the only factory in this hemisphere outside the United States where Intel can assemble and test computer chips.\n\nIntel built it in the 1990s — an investment that transformed the Costa Rican economy by enabling an advanced manufacturing boom. Today, Costa Rica’s biggest export is medical devices, not bananas.\n\nIn 2014, Intel sent much of the work it was doing in Costa Rica to Asia, where testing and packaging were cheaper. But Intel kept a skeleton crew in Costa Rica to do research and development. In 2020 the pandemic caused a chip shortage so acute that Intel has fired up its Costa Rican factory again.\n\nI toured that factory recently and can report that it is expanding so fast that a cafeteria has been turned into a new part of the factory floor. If Americans want to quickly reduce their dependency on Asia for computer chips, this place is crucial.\n\nIts importance is underscored by a visit on Thursday by the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo. It shows the administration understands reality: Semiconductor supply chains are global, and the United States can’t go it alone.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7768581196413202,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1722,"startIndex":1489,"uri":"https://castorina.news/Article/20240322/conversations-and-insights-about-the-moment.?is_ai=true"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   China\n*   Taiwan\n*   United States (also referred to as \"American\" and \"U.S.\")\n*   Asia\n*   Costa Rica (also referred to as \"Costa Rican\")\n*   Central America"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-45.83462905883789}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.158414Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4dac7VCcLM1PIPk9al8QU","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":1566},"candidatesTokenCount":59,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":59}],"promptTokenCount":385,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":385}],"thoughtsTokenCount":903,"totalTokenCount":1347,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.303839+00:00"}

after Israeli naval strikes targeted Yemen's energy infrastructure earlier in the day.\n\nThe strikes hit the Haziz power station south of Houthi-controlled Sanaa, leading to a large fire and power outage, Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported yesterday.\n\nWork to repair the damage and restore the power outage was underway, Houthi Deputy Prime Minister Mohammed Muftah said after inspecting the site.\n\nThis morning, Israel's Maariv daily said that the naval strikes were part of Israel's multi-pronged military approach to dealing with the Houthis and \"all players in the region\", which included its air force and drone technology.\n\nEgypt, Qatar reportedly hand new ceasefire proposal to Hamas\n\nEgypt and Qatar have reportedly handed Hamas a new proposal to resume the Gaza ceasefire talks.\n\nThe Saudi-funded pan-Arab Al Arabiya website quoted unnamed sources today as saying that representatives from Egypt and Qatar conveyed the new initiative to the movement in the presence of leaders of several Palestinian factions.\n\nThe sources added that faction leaders urged Hamas to prepare a response to the proposal \"within the coming hours\", according to the website.\n\nThis

rejection of Israeli plans to displace Palestinians\n\nEgypt has reiterated its rejection of any Israeli plans to displace Palestinians in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank after reports of Israeli negotiations with some countries to receive Palestinians displaced from Gaza.\n\nThe Egyptian foreign ministry said in a Facebook statement yesterday that it made communications with those countries which \"confirmed their rejection of such denounced plans\".\n\nThe ministry emphasised Egypt's \"categorical rejection\" of any Israeli plans to displace Palestinians \"whether voluntarily or by force through policies of starvation, confiscating lands, settlements and making life impossible in Palestinian territories\".\n\nIt stressed that Egypt will neither accept displacement nor participate in it, describing it as a \"historical injustice that has no moral or legal justification\".\n\nHundreds of Bedouin fighters reject secession calls by protesters in Syria's Suweida\n\nProtests in Syria's restive southern province of Suweida (also Sweida) on 16 August calling for secession drew condemnation from Bedouin tribes and fighters, Syrian media reported yesterday.\n\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that \"hundreds of fighters\" from tribes of southern Syria had gathered in Rakham, a village in Deraa province near Suweida, to denounce the calls.\n\nMeanwhile, the pro-government Zaman al-Wasl website reported yesterday that tribes \"displaced\" from recent clashes in Suweida had condemned the presence of Israeli flags at the protest, blaming \"militias led by Hajri\" - a reference to controversial Druze cleric Hikmat al-Hajri.\n\nThe latest comes after Suweida witnessed a wave of deadly sectarian violence in mid-July between Druze factions, local Bedouin tribes and Syrian government forces.\n\nSuicide explosion reported in Aleppo, no casualties\n\nA suicide bomber detonated his belt outside a bakery in

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Hosting the leaders of Poland at the White House, Mr. Biden made a show of defiance not only against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who continues to wage war on Ukraine, but also, implicitly at least, against Mr. Trump, who has said he would “encourage” Russia to attack NATO members that do not spend enough on their militaries.\n\n“When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,” Mr. Biden said, citing former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Czech-born diplomat who championed NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and her homeland, finalized on this day in 1999 with the support of Mr. Biden, then a senator. “I believed that then, and I believe it now,” he added.\n\nThe meeting with President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland marked the 25th anniversary of their country’s accession to NATO, which was the beginning of a quarter-century post-Cold War expansion of the alliance into parts of Europe previously dominated by the old Soviet Union. Just this month, NATO formally welcomed Sweden, which like Finland joined in response to Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022, increasing the alliance to 32 members, up from 16 when the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nMr. Biden used the occasion to announce $300 million in additional weapons and military equipment for Ukraine, a small fraction of what he has asked Congress for but all he could squeeze out of savings from previous arms transfers without additional legislative authority. He pressed House Republican leaders to stop blocking legislation passed by the Senate for $60 billion in security aid to Ukraine, a measure that has bipartisan support and would almost surely pass if brought to the floor.\n\n“We must act before it literally is too late, before it’s too late, because as Poland remembers, Russia won’t stop at Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said. “Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States and the entire free world at risk.”\n\nMr. Biden praised the Polish leaders not only for investing in the alliance but also for taking in about one million Ukrainians who have fled the war. “You’re doing God’s work,” he told the leaders. “You really are. It’s incredible what you’re doing, what the Polish people are doing.”\n\nHe also promised Poland a $2 billion military loan and approved the sale of 96 Apache attack helicopters to Warsaw.\n\nPoland sits on the frontline of the alliance, perpetually wary of Russian revanchism and staunchly supportive of Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, as it defends itself against Mr. Putin’s forces. Poland spends more on its military as a proportion than any other member of the alliance, nearly 4 percent of its economy, twice the alliance’s goal. Mr. Duda used the White House visit to propose that NATO increase its target from 2 percent of gross domestic product to 3 percent.\n\n“Other allies must take more responsibility for the security of the alliance as a whole,” Mr. Duda said as he sat with Mr. Biden in the East Room of the White House. “Two percent was good 10 years ago. Now 3 percent is required in response to the full-scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO’s eastern border.”\n\nThe alliance’s leaders agreed in 2014 to the 2 percent goal, but it was a nonbinding aspiration to meet by 2024. While several American presidents have pushed NATO to do more for its own defense, Mr. Trump was more bellicose in demanding that allies raise their military spending and spoke of it as if they owed the money to the United States, which was not true.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, the number of NATO members meeting the 2 percent goal increased to nine from six. Under Mr. Biden, it has doubled to 18, reflecting rising fear of Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The United States spends 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, and most of the other top spenders are in Eastern Europe, closer to Russia. Collectively, the European allies are spending 2 percent of their combined gross domestic product this year, or $380 billion.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden did not mention Mr. Trump by name on Tuesday, Mr. Tusk seemed to allude to comments in which the former president scoffed at the mutual defense obligation in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. “We treat our obligations seriously, more than anyone else in Europe,” Mr. Tusk said. “And we hope that none of our NATO partners will undermine the most important obligation, which is Article 5 of the treaty.”\n\nThe visit by the Polish leaders was the first since a landmark election in October, when opposition parties defeated the ruling Law and Justice party, a right-wing faction accused of subverting democracy as it consolidated power over major institutions like the judiciary, the news media, the central bank and large state-controlled corporations.\n\nMr. Duda and Mr. Tusk, who was installed in December as prime minister, are fierce rivals who have clashed repeatedly at home. Mr. Duda is an ally of Law and Justice who curried favor with Mr. Trump when he was in office, while Mr. Tusk is a veteran centrist who during a previous stint as prime minister from 2007 to 2014 worked with Mr. Biden, then the vice president.\n\nTheir conflict led to a dramatic showdown in January when Mr. Duda gave shelter in the presidential palace to two former officials from his party previously convicted of abuse of power. Mr. Tusk accused Mr. Duda of obstruction of justice, and the police were sent into the palace to arrest the former officials.\n\nBut in a measure of how seriously Poland takes the Russian threat, the two rivals agreed to put aside their differences for their joint visit with Mr. Biden. “I differ politically with President Andrzej Duda on almost everything,” Mr. Tusk wrote in Polish on social media, “but when it comes to the security of our homeland, we must and will act together. Not only during a visit to the USA.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9833419955506617,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":897,"startIndex":552,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":1334,"startIndex":973,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":1773,"startIndex":1448,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":2600,"startIndex":2104,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":2902,"startIndex":2651,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":3274,"startIndex":2984,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":4236,"startIndex":3722,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":4620,"startIndex":4327,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":5060,"startIndex":4719,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":5595,"startIndex":5171,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":6205,"startIndex":5789,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":6567,"startIndex":6303,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/biden-offers-ironclad-commitment-to-allies-defying-russia-and-trump/"},{"endIndex":7759,"startIndex":6654,"title":"Your prompt"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   White House\n*   Poland\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Hungary\n*   Czech (referring to the Czech Republic)\n*   Europe\n*   Soviet Union\n*   Sweden\n*   Finland\n*   Berlin Wall\n*   United States (also referred to as USA, American)\n*   Warsaw\n*   East Room (within the White House)\n*   Eastern Europe"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-96.36751556396484}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:31.441186Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"X94daeL2Gpe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4882},"candidatesTokenCount":98,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":98}],"promptTokenCount":1287,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1287}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2025,"totalTokenCount":3410,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.101526+00:00"}

The work for which this funding is earmarked will start in March.\n\nTo prevent enemy movement, border reinforcement in Latvia will start with the excavation of existing roads to create anti-tank ditches, while later drainage ditches along the border will also be converted into anti-tank ditches.\n\nVarious types of barriers will also be formed, such as reinforcement of anti-tank ditches with concrete blocks and structures such as 'dragon's teeth' and anti-tank mines. The placement of obstacles will also be adapted to the terrain, using natural obstacles such as marshes, forests and other natural features.\n\nAt the same time, secure storage facilities for explosives, mines and engineering material will be identified and established in the border area for rapid reinforcement of defensive positions.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: It was a slice of Americana rousing one of France's most modern fighting vessels, beginning another day under Italian command, in war games involving 13 nations.\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is NATO: a multinational alliance built around the idea that its 32 countries spread across three continents could turn their diversity into strength and fight as one if the need arose.\n\nThe Nordic Response 2024 exercises — bringing together more than 20,000 soldiers with different languages, equipment, habits and histories — are intended to foster the teamwork necessary for the alliance to function.\n\nThey are training with the knowledge that Russia and other potential adversaries are watching for any weaknesses in NATO defenses and unity.\n\nAmong the nations drilling is Sweden, NATO’s 32nd and newest member. Its induction last week and the addition of Finland last year dramatically illustrated how Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year, shifted Europe’s post-Cold War security landscape.\n\nFrom shunning military alliances, the two Nordic nations reached for NATO's security umbrella and its guarantee that an attack on any one member would be considered as an attack on them all.\n\nIn the frozen extremes of northern Finland, Norway and Sweden, the NATO drills are a test for troops and their fighting machines. Participating nations are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States.\n\nThe nearly two weeks of drills conclude this week. They are part of a months-long program of NATO maneuvers dubbed Steadfast Defender 24 that are its biggest since the Cold War, with 90,000 troops. The alliance says the intention is “to demonstrate NATO’s ability to defend every inch of its territory” — an unmistakable signal to Russia.\n\nCertainly, participating troops suspect that Russia is watching.\n\nAboard the French frigate Normandie, the crew of 146 scrambled to battle stations when an unknown aircraft that came from the direction of Russia strayed too close for comfort last week, in international airspace north of the warship's Nordic Response patrol zone in Arctic waters.\n\nThe Normandie's commanding officer, Capt. Thomas Vuong, told Associated Press journalists aboard that the flight appeared to have been a Russian test of NATO readiness. Norway scrambled F-35 fighters to intercept the aircraft, which headed back in Russia's direction, he said.\n\nNATO regularly scrambles jets to scope Russian flights, taking to the skies for more than 500 interceptions in 2022. The number dropped but was still more than 300 encounters in 2023, the Brussels-headquartered alliance says.\n\n“These are maneuvers that are fairly standard, maneuvers where the Russians test the procedures,\" Vuong said, speaking exclusively to AP. Russia has “resources in the skies, at sea that are employed and which enable them to test the alliance's defenses.\"\n\nListening to the NATO drills' radio traffic gives a flavor of the melting pot of nations and cultures in the transatlantic organization. Communications are in English but accents betray the array of nationalities: French, Italian, German, British, American and more.\n\n“We have a technical vocabulary and everyone uses it,\" said Lt. Olivier, pilot of the Normandie's submarine-hunting NH90 helicopter. The French military withheld his family name for security reasons.\n\n“As you can hear, it’s not perfect English,” he said. \"But since it’s always the same technical words, everyone is able to understand the picture, the situation, and to react if necessary.”\n\nIn the decades since its founding by 12 countries in 1949, NATO has worked to standardize procedures and equipment to enable troops to work and, if necessary, fight together more readily. The flight deck of the Normandie, for example, is equipped to receive other countries' helicopters.\n\nThe alliance “functions because there are military headquarters developing interoperability within NATO, which means we ensure that we have systems that function together, that communicate together,\" Vuong said. “This gives us the capability to operate together when we meet at sea.”\n\nVuong added that he senses “a real willingness” from alliance sailors “to make sure we raise our standard within NATO as high as possible.”\n\nLt. Sebastian, a German navy officer who hitched a ride aboard the Normandie to make a port call during the exercises, said working with and learning from other NATO nations helps alliance troops improve. He wouldn't give his family name.\n\n“Of course you can do your job on your own, going to sea with just one ship,\" he said. But \"NATO means a whole group of abilities and that is what we train here, to use all the abilities combined together.”\n\n___\n\nAP coverage of NATO at https://apnews.com/hub/nato and of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.668617926703559,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1113,"startIndex":888,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":1402,"startIndex":1192,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":2710,"startIndex":2373,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":3440,"startIndex":3103,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":3896,"startIndex":3611,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":4312,"startIndex":4009,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":5016,"startIndex":4767,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"},{"endIndex":5412,"startIndex":5130,"uri":"https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_march_13_2024"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   France\n*   Italy\n*   Nordic (region)\n*   Russia\n*   Sweden\n*   Finland\n*   Ukraine\n*   Europe\n*   Norway\n*   Belgium\n*   Britain\n*   Canada\n*   Denmark\n*   Germany\n*   Netherlands\n*   Spain\n*   United States\n*   Arctic waters\n*   Brussels"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-60.17561340332031}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.694024Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4daYiuKqHp1PIPx6PS2AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4123},"candidatesTokenCount":90,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":90}],"promptTokenCount":1035,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1035}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1566,"totalTokenCount":2691,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:51.038356+00:00"}

It was shared the following day on Telegram by a number of Syria-focused Islamist and pro-opposition accounts, including by former HTS member Abu Yahya al-Farghali.\n\nAppointments\n\nThe statement announced the appointment of two deputies to TIP-Syria leader, Abu Omar Kawthar.&#160;\n\nThey were named as Abu Muhammad (aka Zahid Qari), identified as TIP-Syria's military commander, and someone named only as Sheikh Touba, whose honorary title of \"Sheikh\" suggests seniority or scholarly credentials.\n\nBoth individuals appear to be relatively unknown, with little apparent online presence in jihadist social media circles.\n\nThe statement said the decision to make these appointments came after consultations between the Shura councils of central TIP and its Syrian branch.\n\nIt also stressed the importance of communication between the central TIP leadership and its Syria chapter.\n\n&#8220;We ask of the brothers to obey what is correct, and advise all officials in the Syrian branch to make sure to communicate with their central leadership and interact it with it righteously.&#8221;\n\nMessage on unity\n\nThe message carried an implicit warning against fragmentation, hinting at difficult times for TIP followers.\n\nAddressing its members in Syria, the leadership told them: &#8220;At a time when Islam has become alienated, and especially the Muslims of Turkistan, who are subject to terrible persecution, we ask of you to preserve the unity of the group and strengthen cooperation between yourselves and be at peace with one another.&#8221;\n\nIt also urged them to obey TIP leadership, whilst also encouraging them to offer advice and suggestions.&#160;\n\nOverall, the statement was vague on why the appointments were made, if they replaced existing officials or were new, and if TIP has been affected by the protests dogging its ally, HTS.&#160;\n\nThe TIP has been active in northern Syria since the early days of the Syrian conflict. It has been fighting alongside HTS, under the latter's joint operations room al-Fatah al-Mubin, while officially remaining autonomous and often trying to avoid infighting and inter-rebel friction.&#160;\n\nThe group frequently criticises China for occupying the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, which it calls &#8220;East Turkistan,&#8221; and for the alleged persecution of Uyghur Muslims.&#160;\n\nIn December last year, TIP set up social media accounts, but the group's media operation and outlets nevertheless continue to suffer from instability.\n\nSource: X (formerly Twitter) in Arabic 1430 GMT 25 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.5119198608398436,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   north-west Syria\n*   Syria\n*   Idlib\n*   Turkistan\n*   northern Syria\n*   China\n*   Xinjiang\n*   East Turkistan"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-75.59599304199219}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.882914Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daeLxNZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2663},"candidatesTokenCount":50,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":50}],"promptTokenCount":716,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":716}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1121,"totalTokenCount":1887,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.679481+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Khan asked journalist Shahbaz Rana about the government's preparations for acquiring a new IMF programme. Rana said an element of uncertainty in the economy has been reduced in the last nine months and reports about a possible default are not being heard anymore. He explained the reason behind it is that an \"umbrella\" of the IMF is available to Pakistan. He noted since the previous IMF programme had failed, there was a lack of confidence in Pakistan, which has now decreased.\n\nRana noted Pakistan had achieved a \"phase of stability\" earlier as well but governments started taking political decisions after that. However, he said, the situation this time would be different because all stakeholders and foreign players having interest in Pakistan's economy have said this is the \"last chance for Pakistan\" and there is \"no room for mistakes\". He was of the view that in the next programme, the IMF would want Pakistan to reform its power sector so that the cost of electricity can be reduced.\n\nKhan spoke with former finance minister Miftah Ismail and asked him to share his views on the current signs of improvement in the economy. Ismail said several good things have taken place, for example, cotton crop has been very good this year. However, he added, there have been problems in some sectors as the government has massively increased gas and electricity prices and it is affecting the industries. He noted it has been proven that things can improve if focused measures like controlling the Afghan Transit Trade and stopping illegal transfer of foreign exchange are taken. He was of the view that the IMF agreement for release of the third tranche is \"very encouraging\" and Pakistan would be able to smoothly go into the next three-year programme.\n\nKhan spoke with Imtiaz Gadar, an expert on economic affairs, and asked him why the stock market is cautious even though the economy has started showing signs of improvement. Gadar said the market has certainly taken a \"cautious stance\" because it probably wants to see some of the things materialise. He noted the IMF programme prioritises stability and then moves towards growth. He expressed the view that if Pakistan goes into a long-term IMF programme, a \"built-in discount in the economy\" that Pakistan's external position is very weak would change, and the country can work towards growth in the second phase of the programme. Commenting on the SIFC as a platform for multiple stakeholders in the economy, he emphasised the results would certainly be good if all stakeholders are on the same page and work for combined objectives in the economy.\n\nIsmail insisted the interest rate should be reduced. Noting that the current prices of Pakistan's bonds are at the \"highest in two years\", he said this indicates that \"the world is happy that Pakistan is going in the right direction\" and investors have greater confidence in Pakistani bonds.\n\nKhan commented China is one of Pakistan's most important friends and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (mega development project) is to be \"revitalised\", but at the same time, the United States (US) is also important to Pakistan. He asked Ismail how Pakistan can strike a balance between China and the US in economic matters. Ismail said Pakistan can neither leave China, nor the US. He mentioned China is Pakistan's \"biggest single country lender\" and most of the electricity in Pakistan is being generated due to its support. He added at the same time, the US and Western Europe are the biggest buyers of Pakistani exports.\n\nIsmail was of the view that Pakistan needs to take China and the US along simultaneously, which is a very \"delicate\" task and is not easy. He said the situation would get better and a balance between China and the US would be maintained if Pakistan starts collecting more taxes and stands on its own feet. He remarked a country as big as Pakistan needs to maintain friendly relations with all the countries.\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1630 GMT 20 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8870305220286051,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Afghanistan (implied by \"Afghan Transit Trade\")\n*   China\n*   United States (US)\n*   Western Europe\n*   Lahore"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-42.57746505737305}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.876390Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daea-NcK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3363},"candidatesTokenCount":48,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":48}],"promptTokenCount":815,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":815}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1415,"totalTokenCount":2278,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.865914+00:00"}

The meteorite north of Stockholm, made of iron, was the 10th fresh-fall meteorite — newly landed, rather than older and buried in the ground — to have been found in Sweden, and one of only a handful of fresh-fall iron meteorites found in the world, Mr. Forsberg said.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the men took the rock to the Swedish Museum of Natural History, where it has been held since 2020.\n\n“We were afraid that hundreds of people from all over would show up to search for more,” Mr. Forsberg added. “Better and bigger pieces could leave the country before we knew it.”\n\nDan Holtstam, a senior researcher in the museum’s department of geosciences, said, “It’s a textbook example of an iron meteorite.”\n\n“Falls of iron meteorites are rare globally — this is the only observed fall of an iron meteorite in Sweden,” Dr. Holtstam added. “In almost 40 years in geoscience, it was the first time I laid my hands on a newly fallen meteorite.”\n\nIn addition to their scientific value, meteorites are prized by collectors. In the global market of private collectors, one like this could garner tens of thousands of dollars, Dr. Holtstam said.\n\nAbout a week after the geologists went public with their find, the owner of the estate where the meteorite had been found, Johan Benzelstierna von Engestrom, sent a letter to the museum claiming ownership.\n\nThe legal battle ensued.\n\nLaws regulating the ownership of found meteorites vary from country to country. In Sweden, there are none. In France and Morocco, on the other hand, “the first to put his or her hands on it has ownership of it,” Dr. Holtstam said. In Denmark, they are state property.\n\nIn December 2022, the Uppsala District Court ruled in favor of the geologists, deeming the meteorite movable property. “A newly fallen meteorite is not part of the property on which it has landed,” the judge wrote in a statement.\n\nThe landowner appealed. On Thursday, the appeals court in Stockholm ruled in his favor.\n\nJudge Robert Green, one of four judges on the case, said the appeals court’s ruling turned on two questions: whether meteorites could be considered “immovable” property and the extent of a Swedish customary law, known as “Allemansrätten,” that provides the right of public access.\n\nLaws applying to immovable property — houses and land — are clear, the judge said.\n\n“The point of departure regarding immovable property is that the landowner has the right to it,” he said in an interview Friday. “But we have no specific law regarding meteorites, which made this case special.”\n\nAllemansrätten entitles everyone in Sweden to move around in nature, including to hike, bike or camp, even on private property.\n\n“That includes some right to take berries and even small rocks from other people’s property,” Judge Green said.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the right to pick up small things could include amber and more valuable items. But Judge Green said in the ruling, “We have made the assessment that the closest thing to hand is to consider meteorites or space rocks as part of immovable property just like other stones, even though it may intuitively feel like a meteorite is something foreign to the earth.”\n\nOne judge dissented, arguing that while the meteorite should be regarded as immovable property, in this case, the customary law also applied, and should be interpreted to include the right to take a meteorite from private property.\n\n“Allemansratt has far-reaching implications for everyone so it was interesting and important for us to try this,” Judge Green said.\n\nMr. Benzelstierna von Engestrom praised the ruling, saying in an interview, “I want to retain ownership of it but give it to a Swedish museum on permanent loan.”\n\nHe did not specify which museum, but said that he wanted it to benefit the public.\n\nThe geologists have not decided whether to appeal to Sweden’s Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Forsberg said they were disappointed by the appellate decision.\n\n“It’s very sad for me and my friend,” he said. “I’ve been passionate about collecting rocks and fossils my whole life.” He added: “It’s sad for all of the enthusiasts that are interested in finding new meteorites. If people don’t think they’ll get a reward, how are we going to get people out searching?”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.5054776118351862,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1394,"startIndex":1110,"uri":"https://livesinsight.com/swedish-court-decides-fate-of-fallen-meteorite/"},{"endIndex":1818,"startIndex":1407,"uri":"https://sciencesprings.wordpress.com/2024/04/13/from-the-new-york-times-a-rock-fell-from-space-into-sweden-who-owns-it-on-earth/"},{"endIndex":2638,"startIndex":2078,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":2990,"startIndex":2663,"uri":"https://sciencesprings.wordpress.com/2024/04/13/from-the-new-york-times-a-rock-fell-from-space-into-sweden-who-owns-it-on-earth/"},{"endIndex":3400,"startIndex":2956,"uri":"https://sciencesprings.wordpress.com/2024/04/13/from-the-new-york-times-a-rock-fell-from-space-into-sweden-who-owns-it-on-earth/"},{"endIndex":3678,"startIndex":3449,"uri":"https://sciencesprings.wordpress.com/2024/04/13/from-the-new-york-times-a-rock-fell-from-space-into-sweden-who-owns-it-on-earth/"},{"endIndex":4562,"startIndex":3941,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":5649,"startIndex":4589,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":6312,"startIndex":5903,"uri":"https://sciencesprings.wordpress.com/2024/04/13/from-the-new-york-times-a-rock-fell-from-space-into-sweden-who-owns-it-on-earth/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Stockholm\n*   Sweden\n*   Swedish Museum of Natural History\n*   France\n*   Morocco\n*   Denmark\n*   Uppsala District Court\n*   Sweden's Supreme Court"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-78.28483581542969}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.654751Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"a94daZ_7J8CSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4328},"candidatesTokenCount":52,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":52}],"promptTokenCount":1169,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1169}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1739,"totalTokenCount":2960,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:55.747655+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: On Saturday night, the Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, immediately clarified that the pope meant “cease-fire and negotiation,” not surrender, when he said white flag, a universal symbol for giving up.\n\nBut the pope’s words and others he used during the interview have underscored how the Vatican has often bewildered Ukraine’s officials and supporters struggling to understand its position.\n\nEarly in the war, many Ukrainians expressed frustration with Francis for his refusal to specifically call out Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, as the aggressor in the conflict.\n\nFrancis eventually became more vocal in expressing support for what he came to call “martyred Ukraine,” citing Russia’s aggression and praying for Ukraine’s innocent victims. But the Vatican had also sought to avoid taking sides in the war, in part to preserve the possibility that it could be called on to negotiate a peace deal, a hope many geopolitical analysts consider delusional.\n\nFrancis used the term white flag in a television interview taped in February with the Swiss television channel RSI. The topic of the interview was the color white. An interviewer asked Francis if he believed that in Ukraine there was the need to “surrender, the white flag in this case,” or if such a capitulation would only legitimize the actions of strongmen.\n\nAccording to footage of the pope’s interview provided by the public broadcaster, which is to be aired later this month, Francis responded by saying the fear of encouraging the aggressor was “one interpretation, it’s true. But I believe that the strongest is the one who sees the situation, thinks of the people, and has the courage of the white flag, and to negotiate.”\n\nMr. Bruni said the pope was using the image proposed by the interviewer to indicate “the ceasing of hostilities, the peace reached with the courage of negotiation.” He pointed out that later in the interview, Francis said, “negotiation is never a surrender.”\n\nBut in that same sentence, Francis calls negotiation “the courage to not bring a country to its suicide.”\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, responding to the pope’s comments, said on the social media platform X that Ukraine’s “flag is a yellow and blue one,” not white.\n\n“This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail,” he wrote. “We shall never raise any other flags.”\n\nThe pope has made other statements that have made Ukrainian officials and supporters uneasy, once saying that there was a secret Vatican “mission” to bring peace to the conflict. His habit of giving audiences to allies and officials of Mr. Putin’s government and his blanket condemnation of the arms trade — when Kyiv needs weapons to defend itself — has also undermined the confidence of some Ukrainians in the pope’s support for their cause.\n\nIn the interview with RSI, Francis said that today “one can negotiate with the help of international powers, they are there, no? That word negotiate, it is a courageous word.”\n\nHe added, “When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate.”\n\n“And you are ashamed of yourself?” for negotiating, he continued, adding that if instead, one continued on the same path, “how many dead, and then? In the end it will be worse still.”\n\nHe added that it was critical “to negotiate in time, find some country that can act as a mediator.”\n\n“Today, for example,” he went on, “in the war in Ukraine, there are many that want to be mediators, no? Turkey for example. Do not be ashamed to negotiate before things get worse.”\n\nFrancis has himself frequently sought to position the Vatican as such a mediator. Asked in the interview if he would be willing to play such a role, he responded: “I am here, period. I’ve said this.”\n\nMr. Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, added on Saturday that the pope’s hope remains that a diplomatic solution can be reached for a “just and lasting peace.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.1570985582139757,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1971,"startIndex":1706,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/pope-says-ukraine-should-have-the-courage-of-the-white-flag.html"},{"endIndex":2328,"startIndex":2072,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/pope-says-ukraine-should-have-the-courage-of-the-white-flag.html"},{"endIndex":3367,"startIndex":3098,"uri":"https://perilofafrica.com/2024/03/pope-says-ukraine-should-have-the-courage-of-the-white-flag.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Vatican\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   Switzerland (implied by \"Swiss television channel RSI\")\n*   Kyiv\n*   Turkey"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-52.069435119628906}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.396117Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4dadWWGJe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3298},"candidatesTokenCount":45,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":45}],"promptTokenCount":845,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":845}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1287,"totalTokenCount":2177,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.779226+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: This was on a recent afternoon in the chilly basement of a midtown hotel where McGregor and Winstead perched on a love seat, his jacket over his shoulders, his hand on her knee. They met in 2017, on the set of the third season of “Fargo,” co-starring as Ray Stussy, a hapless parole officer, and Nikki Swango, his grifter sweetheart. (McGregor also played Emmit Stussy, Ray’s twin.) Two years later, in 2019, they filmed “Birds of Prey” but did not share scenes. They are also both participants in the “Star Wars” franchise — McGregor in the ’90s and ’00s films and the more recent “Obi-Wan Kenobi” series, Winstead in “Ahsoka” — though again they did not share scenes. In 2021, Winstead gave birth to their son. The next year, they married.\n\nNow, they have reunited onscreen for “A Gentleman in Moscow,” which premiered Friday on Paramount+ and debuts Sunday on Showtime. An adaptation of Amor Towles’s novel, it stars McGregor as Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, a mustached aristocrat sentenced to house arrest in a luxury hotel in the years following the Russian Revolution. Winstead appears as Anna Urbanova, an actress and the count’s sometimes girlfriend. Somehow, in the confines of the hotel, they make a life.\n\nIn an hourlong conversation, in a hotel somewhat more modest than Moscow’s Metropol, they discussed claustrophobia, facial hair and the benefits and detriments of working with a spouse. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nHow did you get involved with “A Gentleman in Moscow”?\n\nEWAN MCGREGOR It came to me first. I loved the grand nature of the drama, the love and loss and romance. I feel like it’s rarer and rarer to get a chance to play that stuff. At the heart of it, it’s about a man who’s learning to be a husband and learning to be a dad and crawling out of his ideas of the aristocratic way of life to find who he really is.\n\nMARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD You had hinted, cheekily, that there was a great female character in there. Reading the book, I just thought, ‘Oh my God, what a great, juicy opportunity that would be to play her.’ But I was very tentative because the last thing I wanted was to try to win a role and then have somebody think I was trying to get something out of being married to you. I just wanted to quietly say, “I think it’s a great role if you think I’m right for it.”\n\nDid you ever worry that it would feel claustrophobic, shooting in these few hotel rooms?\n\nMCGREGOR It had to feel like that. It should feel like that. It focuses a magnifying glass on these characters.\n\nWINSTEAD That’s one of the great things about confined spaces. As an actor, it’s exciting because there’s nowhere to go but into the words. It’s great to know that’s going to be the focus, rather than pyrotechnics.\n\nDid you grow your own mustache?\n\nMCGREGOR I had to. I couldn’t have a stuck-on mustache. I’ve had them in the past and they’re terrible to wear. You come in in the morning, you’ve had to shave and then you put glue on that shaved skin, which is [expletive] horrible. Then you stick it on and it stops you from moving your face. The last thing you want to be thinking about when you’re acting is not moving. So I grew my own.\n\nDuring the strike, I didn’t know when we’d be going back, so I just grew a beard around it. Because you don’t want a mustache in your real life. I mean, you do if you like mustaches, but I don’t.\n\nTell me about Alexander.\n\nMCGREGOR He’s an aristocrat. He enjoyed the high life of his class at that time. Then it’s taken away during the revolution. He’s allowed to live, but the rest of his class is destroyed. So he’s somewhat lost.\n\nAnd what about Anna? Is she a good actress?\n\nWINSTEAD Anna believes that she is. I do think she takes it very seriously. It’s something positive in her life that gives her a sense of purpose. She does hang in there, even if she’s not always a star. That has to count for something.\n\nThey have a superb meet-cute, when the count tames Anna’s Russian wolfhounds. What’s their initial attraction?\n\nWINSTEAD I instantly find him very intriguing. The way that he handles my dogs, it sparks a little something. Our repartee makes me further intrigued. Then hearing about him and knowing that he’s imprisoned in this hotel, the mystery is interesting to me as a woman who gets bored very easily by most men that I’m around. Over time, that leads to much, much more.\n\nIt’s so lovely how much time it takes. It’s many years into their relationship before they realize they’re in love. There’s something beautiful about that slow progression. Especially for Anna. She resists that feeling. But it hits her like a wave.\n\nI understand that you didn’t know each other before “Fargo.” But Mary, is it true that you had a crush on him as a teenager?\n\nWINSTEAD The thing is, if you were a teenager when “Trainspotting” and “Moulin Rouge” came out, I don’t think you could not have an awareness. But I didn’t have any posters on my wall. I wasn’t writing his name in my notebook.\n\nGood, that would be creepy. What was it like working together on “Fargo”?\n\nWINSTEAD We loved it.\n\nMCGREGOR We did. It was amazing writing. I feel like there were two shows because I played the two characters. But our story line was amazing. To play Ray and Nikki, what a great pair, what a great partnership, what a great oddball couple.\n\nWINSTEAD I remember meeting with Noah [Hawley, the showrunner] and my only question was, “Does she really love him?” And he was like, “Yes.” And that made it so much more interesting, to play a grifter with a heart, as cheesy as that sounds. So much more fun to have something real at the center of it.\n\nMary, earlier you alluded to a downside of working together, in that people might think you were offered a role for reasons other than your talent.\n\nWINSTEAD Of course, there’s always going to be one person on the internet who makes that comment, but I’m secure enough to not worry about that because I know the truth, which is that people want to work with me. When we were first together, I was up for a role in something that he was in. They were worried we would bring some sort of drama to the set, which we thought was very funny because we’re not very dramatic people. But you have to let time deal with that. Now it’s clear that we’re a pretty levelheaded couple, that we’re not going around smashing vases. Other than that, it’s really been just upsides, which is that people who know us and like our work are happy and excited to put us together occasionally, which is a really lucky thing for us.\n\nMCGREGOR There’s no downside in terms of actually doing it. It’s only great to go to work together, get to work together, come home together. It’s as good as it could be, really.\n\nWhat was it like working together this time?\n\nMCGREGOR It made it so much more fun to play all the cold-shoulder stuff at the beginning of the story. After they’ve spent the night together, she won’t speak to him or look at him.\n\nWINSTEAD Then the later stuff, when things get deep, it was very emotional. I can’t talk about it without crying. It was just all there, which is an amazing thing. It’s just like, Oh, I’m here in front of my partner. So I’ll just let all those feelings wash over.\n\nDid you like him with that mustache?\n\nWINSTEAD You know, I did. I did for a long time. But I did start to miss his face underneath it.\n\nWill you work together again?\n\nWINSTEAD I don’t know.\n\nMCGREGOR (simultaneously) Yes!\n\nWINSTEAD We hope so. It’s just about finding the right beautiful thing.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.860775936351103,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   midtown hotel\n*   basement (of a midtown hotel)\n*   Fargo (referring to the setting/set of the show)\n*   luxury hotel (the setting of \"A Gentleman in Moscow\")\n*   Moscow\n*   Metropol (the specific hotel in Moscow)\n*   hotel rooms (as a filming location)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-158.16595458984375}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.168984Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94daZioCvDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6143},"candidatesTokenCount":85,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":85}],"promptTokenCount":1864,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1864}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1002,"totalTokenCount":2951,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.955779+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: * Who is running and who is likely to win?\n\n* When will we find out the results?\n\n* Where can I find out more information?\n\n* What other elections are happening?\n\nWhy does this election matter?\n\nIndia is holding its multiphase general elections from April 19 to June 1, in a vote that will determine the political direction of the world’s most populous nation for the next five years.\n\nThe usually high-turnout affair, which was formally set on Saturday, is a mammoth undertaking described as the biggest peacetime logistical exercise anywhere.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, whose power is well entrenched, is seeking a third term. In his decade at the helm, he has projected himself as a champion of India’s development, trying to address some of the basic failures — like antiquated infrastructure and a lack of clean water and toilets — holding the country back from reaching its potential as a major power. But his push to reshape India’s secular democracy as a Hindu-first nation has aggravated the religious and ethnic fault lines in the hugely diverse country.\n\nIn a region of frequent political turmoil, India is deeply proud of its nearly undisrupted electoral democracy since its founding as a republic more than 75 years ago. Although independent institutions have come under assault from Mr. Modi’s efforts to centralize power and the ruling party is seen as having an unfair advantage over political fund-raising, voting in India is still seen as free and fair, and results are accepted by candidates.\n\nHow does India vote?\n\nIndia has a parliamentary system of governance. The party leading the majority of the 543 seats in the lower house of the Parliament gets to form the government and appoint as prime minister one of its winning candidates.\n\nThe country has over 960 million eligible voters, with about 470 million of them women. Turnout in Indian elections is usually high, with the parliamentary elections in 2019 drawing a 67 percent turnout.\n\nThe votes are cast electronically across more than a million polling stations that require about 15 million employees during balloting. To reach every possible voter in Himalayan hamlets and isolated islands, election officials will travel by any means possible, in railroads and helicopters, on horseback and boats.\n\nIndia’s elections are the most expensive in the world, with political parties spending more than $7 billion in the 2019 parliamentary elections, according to studies. That spending is expected to double in the current elections. In a sign of how much of a factor money is, Indian authorities seized the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars before the last parliamentary election — in cash, gold, liquor and drugs — that they said was meant for bribing voters.\n\nWho is running, and who is likely to win?\n\nPrime Minister Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party holds a strong majority in the 543-seat Parliament. The B.J.P. won 303 seats in 2019, and along with its coalition partners enjoyed a majority of 352 seats.\n\nAlthough Indian elections are known to throw surprises, Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. is well placed to return to power. His party, relentless in trying to expand its base, is rich in cash and has a strong election machinery. Mr. Modi has built on it a multipronged approach that offers everyone something: There is the wider emotional appeal of his Hindu majoritarian ideology for his main base, coupled with a broad range of welfare and infrastructure programs that tries to win new constituencies to the B.J.P.\n\nThe opposition has struggled to match Mr. Modi’s appeal.\n\nThe Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, ruled India for decades, but it has been reduced to shadow of its former glory in two consecutive national elections. In 2019, it won only 52 seats.\n\nIn the lead-up to this parliamentary election, the opposition has tried to unite as one bloc. They are brought together by fears that a third term for Mr. Modi, who has jailed many opposition party leaders and bogged down others in investigations, would further marginalize them.\n\nBut the opposition has struggled to pitch a cohesive ideological alternative beyond a criticism of Mr. Modi’s divisive politics, and its bickering over seat-sharing in constituencies often spills out in messy public fights.\n\nWhen will we find out the results?\n\nBecause of India’s vast geography, the voting for the parliamentary election happens over seven phases, and it takes nearly six weeks to complete, from the first region casting its vote to the last. Scheduling is a tricky task, entailing trying to find a sweet spot that factors in climate extremes and is considerate of the frequent cultural and religious festivals across India.\n\nThe last stage of voting will be completed on June 1. All results are tallied and announced by end of day on June 4.\n\nWhere can I find more information?\n\nModi Opens a Giant Temple in a Triumph for India’s Hindu Nationalists\n\nIndia Is Passing China in Population.

With the Civil Court ruling PSM had paid 30m rufiyaa ($1.9m) of the 70m rufiyaa to BIG. The case was appealed at the high court in 2021, after the appeal period expired.

Sadow, said that Mr. Trump’s comments, writings and internet posts after the November 2020 election amounted to political speech, which courts have considered sacrosanct under the First Amendment.\n\n“Take out the political speech, no charges,” Mr. Sadow said at the hearing in a courtroom in downtown Atlanta.\n\nFulton County prosecutors pushed back, arguing that Mr. Trump’s statements were part of a broad conspiracy to illegally overturn his election loss. The scheme is outlined in a sweeping racketeering indictment that was handed up in August and that named Mr. Trump alongside 18 co-defendants. Four of the co-defendants have since pleaded guilty.\n\nThe argument that First Amendment grounds should block Mr. Trump from being prosecuted criminally for efforts to overturn the 2020 election results has previously been rejected by a U.S. District Court judge, Tanya Chutkan, in a separate federal prosecution that is unfolding in Washington, D.C.\n\nGeorgia prosecutors noted the earlier ruling in court on Thursday. They also argued that Mr. Trump’s comments should not be considered on their own, but as part of a series of actions aimed to advance crimes including racketeering.\n\nMr. Trump’s statements were “employed as part of the pattern of criminal conduct in numerous ways, so there’s nowhere to go,” said Donald Wakeford, a prosecutor in the Fulton County district attorney’s office.\n\nScott McAfee, the presiding judge in the case, did not make a ruling from the bench on Thursday.\n\nThe hearing was the first to take place since the Georgia case took a detour after defense lawyers asserted that Fulton County’s district attorney, Fani T. Willis, had created a conflict of interest when she engaged in a romantic relationship with Nathan J. Wade, a lawyer she hired to manage the prosecution team.\n\nThis month, Judge McAfee ruled that an “actual” conflict of interest did not exist but that “the appearance of impropriety” remained. To solve the problem, the judge gave Ms. Willis a choice: either Mr. Wade could step away from the case, or she and her entire office could do so. Mr. Wade resigned from his job as special prosecutor a few hours later.\n\nDefense lawyers are seeking to appeal the judge’s ruling on the disqualification matter and reassert their argument that Ms. Willis and her office ought to be removed from the case. Judge McAfee has said that the issue merits review by the Georgia Court of Appeals. The appeals court itself must now decide whether to take the matter.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.831324087606894,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":619,"startIndex":403,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/03/28/trumps-defense-team-argues-first-amendment-prohibits-georgia-charges-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":1721,"startIndex":1429,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/03/28/trumps-defense-team-argues-first-amendment-prohibits-georgia-charges-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":2329,"startIndex":2121,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/03/28/trumps-defense-team-argues-first-amendment-prohibits-georgia-charges-mashaher/"},{"endIndex":2834,"startIndex":2522,"uri":"https://news.mashaher.net/2024/03/28/trumps-defense-team-argues-first-amendment-prohibits-georgia-charges-mashaher/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Atlanta (specifically downtown Atlanta)\n*   Fulton County\n*   Washington, D.C.\n*   Georgia"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-30.758991241455078}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.006708Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dabQ0wJKY0A-Wm6qZBA","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2143},"candidatesTokenCount":37,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":37}],"promptTokenCount":550,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":550}],"thoughtsTokenCount":967,"totalTokenCount":1554,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.297438+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: * Who is running?\n\n* What are the main issues?\n\n* When will the results be released?\n\n* Who is likely to win?\n\n* Where to find more information?\n\n* What other elections are happening?\n\nWhy does this election matter?\n\nIt should have been one of Africa’s more boring polls.\n\nSenegal, with a ticking economy, is seen as a stable, safe country — no small feat in western Africa, where coups, crises and insurgencies abound. A president regarded as a steady hand is stepping down after two terms. A pool of candidates is taken mainly from the political old guard.\n\nBut then the president, Macky Sall, blew up any chance of a mundane election. He went on state television and canceled the vote, alleging corruption in the way candidates were approved by constitutional court.\n\nIn the uproar that followed, Mr. Sall backtracked and said that the vote would go ahead on March 24, nine days before his term ends. And then, in a dramatic move, he released the leading opposition candidate and the leader of the opposition party from prison.\n\nWho is running?\n\nThe governing party’s candidate is Amadou Ba, a former prime minister. The man many see as the main challenger, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, was just released from jail. He’s backed by a popular but divisive politician, Ousmane Sonko. Then there are 17 other candidates, among them former mayors and prime ministers.\n\nBut what’s more important is who’s not running. That would be Mr. Sonko, who cannot take part because he was convicted of corrupting a minor, in a scandal involving a young massage parlor employee who accused him of rape. Mr. Sonko is Mr. Sall’s main opponent, a (relatively) young former tax inspector who has dominated politics in Senegal recently, mainly by criticizing elites and promising to help Senegal’s jobless youth.\n\nMr. Sonko has many critics. But many young Senegalese say he speaks truth to power, and they have repeatedly taken to the streets in his defense despite the risk of death at the hands of the police. Along with Mr. Faye, he was released from jail on Thursday night.\n\nThe other important person unable to run is Karim Wade, son of former President Abdoulaye Wade, who tried to cling to power in 2012 but was defeated by Mr. Sall. The younger Mr. Wade, who is French-Senegalese, is barred from running because he had not renounced his French citizenship when he submitted his candidacy. That’s what started the whole ruckus and led to Mr. Sall’s canceling the election in the first place.\n\nWhat are the main issues?\n\nThe economy is a big one — most Senegalese say that the economic situation is bad and that managing it is the most important problem facing the government, according to Afrobarometer, an independent research network. The economy is growing, but more than 36 percent of people live in poverty.\n\nNearly a third of young people are out of work, and many have set their sights on getting to Europe or America to try to improve their prospects. Thousands take boats to the Canary Islands, perilous desert roads toward the Mediterranean or, most recently, circuitous routes by plane, bus or foot to Central America.\n\nWhen will the results be released?\n\nResults from the first round should emerge about a week after the election next Sunday, but many analysts expect a runoff. The last time that happened, the runoff took place about a month after the first round. Mr. Sall says he’ll leave office by April 2, and if there’s a runoff, the constitutional council says, the head of the national assembly, Amadou Mame Diop, should take over in the interim.\n\nWho is likely to win?\n\nAlmost certainly a former tax inspector. Mr. Ba, who resigned as prime minister to focus on what must be one of the shortest political campaigns, is a former tax inspector. So is Mr. Faye, who is not well known but stands a good chance of winning simply because he was anointed by Mr. Sonko.\n\nNeither Mr. Ba nor Mr. Faye is particularly beloved in Senegal, and neither is expected to win in a landslide. But if the election goes to a runoff, many analysts say it’ll be a choice between the two.\n\nWhere to find more information?\n\nSenegal’s Leading Opposition Politicians Freed From Jail Just Before Election\n\nSenegal’s President Calls Off a National Election.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Israeli media discussed this morning the role of the Israeli government and some media outlets in the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages in captivity, following the release of videos by the military wings of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas showing the hostages suffering from severe malnutrition.\n\nThe Maariv daily reported that \"the families of the hostages, along with an entire nation, are watching their loved ones die before their eyes\". \"This is a terrible, disproportionate punishment inflicted upon us by Israel's criminally negligent government,\" it added.\n\nThe daily Haaretz criticised the media coverage, saying: \"Even in the face of videos proving that Israel's policy is killing the hostages, they continue to deny reality.\" It added: \"Channel 14 skips over it, while Channel 12 babbles on, in both cases normalising the abandonment of the hostages for the most important goal of all: to keep crushing, dismantling, and destroying Gaza.\"\n\nThe videos were released amidst Israeli media's consistent doubt of the extent of hunger in the Gaza Strip, calling it a \"false starvation campaign\".\n\nHamas says ready to deliver food aid to Israeli hostages\n\nHamas has said that it is ready to respond \"positively\" to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine aid to Israeli hostages.\n\n\"We stipulate that humanitarian corridors must be opened on a regular and permanent basis for the passage of food and medicine to all our people in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and that all forms of enemy air strikes must be halted at the time of receiving parcels for prisoners,\" Abu Ubaida, the spokesman of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, said in a Telegram statement yesterday.\n\nThis came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medicine to hostages.\n\nNetanyahu made his request after videos of emaciated Israeli hostages were released by Hamas and the PIJ recently.\n\nUAE airdrops more humanitarian aid to Gaza\n\nThe UAE has said it conducted its 61st airdrop of humanitarian aid in Gaza in coordination with Jordan.\n\nThis brings the total volume of humanitarian aid delivered by air to more than 3,818 tonnes of food and relief materials, directed toward supporting the most affected and vulnerable communities in Gaza, the UAE's official news agency Wam reported yesterday.\n\nMoreover, the agency said that the UAE also facilitated the entry of 20 trucks loaded with food aid into Gaza yesterday.\n\nThe country said it also delivered 11 trucks carrying about 65 tonnes of medical supplies to Gaza in cooperation with the World Health Organisation, according to Wam.\n\nSyrian security forces regain control of Suweida after clashes\n\nA security source has said that Syrian Internal Security Forces (ISF) have regained control on areas in the southern restive province of Suweida (also Sweida) following clashes between government forces and Druze militants, state news agency Sana reported last night.\n\nThe ISF said that it regained control of the Tal al-Hadid, Rima Hazem and Walgha security checkpoints after five government personnel were reported killed following an attack by militants linked to the controversial Druze cleric Hikmat al-Hajri (also Hijri).\n\nSana said that \"Hajri's militias continued to violate the ceasefire agreement by launching treacherous attacks on internal security forces on several fronts, in addition to shelling some villages with rockets and mortar shells\".\n\nThe latest unrest follows the announcement of a ceasefire in southern Syria by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa last month following weeks of deadly violence.\n\nSyria army, Kurdish force trade accusation over attacks in north\n\nThe Syrian defence ministry said that its forces carried out \"precision strikes\" targeting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after they shelled the village of Kayariyeh and its vicinity near Manbij in the northern province of Aleppo, state news agency Sana reported late on 2 August.\n\nEarlier on the same day, Sana cited the ministry as saying that Syrian troops had repelled an attempted infiltration by the SDF into a military post near Kayariyeh, and also reported rocket launches by the SDF targeting residential homes in the village which injured four army personnel and three civilians.\n\nSyrian Kurdish news agency ANHA reported that factions affiliated to the interim Syrian government launched attacks on the frontline with the SDF, chiefly in Deir Hafer.\n\nThe report said that \"unregulated\" groups affiliated to the government had shelled \"populated\" areas on the evening of 2 August, describing the attack as a \"dangerous military escalation\" and saying that the SDF had responded with heavy weaponry.\n\nOver 50 migrants reported drowned, missing in boat capsize off Yemen\n\nMore that 50 migrants have been reported drowned and others missing following a boat capsize off the coast of Yemen's southern Abyan province due to bad weather, domestic media said yesterday.\n\nRescue teams recovered the bodies of 54 male and female irregular migrants, most of whom were Ethiopians, a health official in Zinjibar district was quoted by the privately owned Al-Masdar Online website as saying. The official said that rescue operations were still underway to try and recover the remaining bodies and that the boat was carrying around 150 people, the website reported.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Abyan Security Department called on \"all relevant local and international parties to urgently intervene and take deterrent measures to halt the illegal flow [of migrants] through Yemeni territorial waters, which poses a growing humanitarian and security threat\".\n\nSaudi Arabia, Palestinian groups condemn Ben Gvir's Al-Aqsa visit\n\nSaudi Arabia issued a statement yesterday condemning the visit of Israeli government officials, including far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, describing such actions as \"provocative\". The site is referred to by Jews as Temple Mount.\n\nThe kingdom's foreign ministry warned that the visits of Israeli \"occupation\" officials to the site would further \"fuel conflict\" in the region, and called on the international community to intervene.\n\nPan-Arab media including Qatar's Al Jazeera TV reported that over 1,000 Israeli \"settlers stormed\" the compound early yesterday and noted that it was the highest number of Jewish visitors to visit to date and that police did not prevent them from performing prayers and \"Talmudic rituals\" and waving Israeli flags.\n\nPalestinian factions also condemned Ben Gvir's visit to the compound as \"provocative\" and violating the site's status quo.\n\nLebanon marks fifth anniversary of Beirut port explosion\n\nLebanon is marking the fifth anniversary since the Beirut port explosion which killed some 235 people and injured thousands, domestic media reported.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus due to procedural appeals, the reopening of the domestic probe early this year \"offers hopes for answers\", with hearings finally resuming and with political guarantees by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam - former ICJ president, French-language daily L'Orient-Le Jour reported late last night.\n\nSalam stressed the government's commitment to follow up on the case \"until justice is served\", telling families of the dead in a ceremony yesterday that \"we will not compromise on justice or the truth\".\n\nHe participated in the naming of a street close to Beirut port \"August 4th Victims Street\" following a request from relatives of the dead, in a ceremony attended by other ministers and Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud, the daily reported.\n\nEgyptians start voting in Senate election\n\nEgyptians start voting today in the Senate election, which will continue over two days.\n\nAround 424 candidates are competing for 100 seats under the individual system, including 183 independent candidates and 241 representing political parties, according to the Egyptian privately owned Al-Bawabah News website.\n\nVoting took place on 1-2 August for Egyptians abroad.\n\nThe total number of Senate members is 300, including 100 to be appointed by the president.\n\nA run-off vote will be held abroad on 25-26 August and at home on 27-28 August. The results of the first round will be announced on 12 August, while the run-off results will be made public on 4 September.\n\nThe Senate serves as a consultative chamber within Egypt's bicameral parliamentary system, while legislative authority rests solely with the House of Representatives.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.4224256318191002,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n**Countries:**\n*   Israel\n*   UAE (United Arab Emirates)\n*   Jordan\n*   Syria\n*   Yemen\n*   Saudi Arabia\n*   Qatar\n*   Lebanon\n*   Egypt\n\n**Regions/Territories:**\n*   Gaza Strip (or Gaza)\n*   Southern Syria\n*   Palestinian (implied by \"Palestinian Islamic Jihad\")\n\n**Provinces/Districts/Cities/Villages:**\n*   Suweida (Sweida) (Syria)\n*   Tal al-Hadid (Syria)\n*   Rima Hazem (Syria)\n*   Walgha (Syria)\n*   Kayariyeh (Syria)\n*   Manbij (Syria)\n*   Aleppo (Syria)\n*   Deir Hafer (Syria)\n*   Abyan province (Yemen)\n*   Zinjibar district (Yemen)\n*   Jerusalem (Israel/Palestine)\n*   Beirut (Lebanon)\n\n**Specific Sites:**\n*   Al-Aqsa Mosque compound (Jerusalem)\n*   Temple Mount (Jerusalem - alternative name for Al-Aqsa Mosque compound)\n*   Beirut port (Lebanon)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-110.25308990478516}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.689139Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dafOHKsCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":7247},"candidatesTokenCount":261,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":261}],"promptTokenCount":1763,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1763}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1929,"totalTokenCount":3953,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:52.498216+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Ukraine’s state emergency services said a first missile hit several houses late in the morning, prompting rescuers to rush to the scene. A second missile then landed on the same site, causing many fatalities, including at least one paramedic and a rescue worker. The reports could not be independently verified.\n\nOleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region, posted photos on social media showing rescue workers evacuating one of their colleagues on a stretcher and trying to put out a fire near a destroyed building. A photo released by the Odesa City Council showed what appeared to be a rescuer lying on the grass, his lifeless body covered by a foil blanket.\n\nUkrainian authorities said the attacks destroyed a three-story building, damaged 10 houses and a gas pipeline, and started a fire that spread to an area of about 1,300 square feet.\n\nIt was the third deadly assault on Odesa in two weeks, with a total of at least 38 people killed. It came as Russians began voting in a presidential election that President Vladimir V. Putin was all but certain to win, and while his country’s war in Ukraine had entered its third year and showed no sign of abating.\n\nOn the same day, Russian authorities said Ukrainian shelling of the western city of Belgorod, close to Ukraine, had killed one civilian and wounded two others. Their claims could not be independently verified.\n\nThe Belgorod region has been the scene of cross-border ground attacks by Ukraine-backed Russian groups this week, apparently aimed at disrupting Mr. Putin’s re-election campaign messaging that the war had turned in Moscow’s favor. Russian forces have had the advantage on the battlefield in recent months, attacking simultaneously in several places all along the front line.\n\nThe assault on Odesa on Friday appeared to be what military officials call a “double-tap attack,” hitting the same target twice with a time gap between the two strikes in order to kill emergency workers or firefighters responding to the first strike. Russian forces have used this tactic before in Ukraine and Syria.\n\nVideos posted online by Ukrainian reporters in Odesa showed bodies lying in pools of blood on the pavement, covered with a foil blanket, a simple sheet or a body bag. Andrii Vahapov, a member of the Odesa City Council, said those killed included Odesa’s former deputy mayor, Serhii Tetiukhin, and Oleksandr Hostishchev, the commander of a police special forces unit.\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Army in the south, said the attack had involved ballistic missiles fired from Crimea, the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula.\n\nOdesa, a lifeline for the Ukrainian economy, is home to a vast port infrastructure vital to Ukraine’s Black Sea exports. Many vessels depart from the port to ship grain and other agricultural products across the Black Sea.\n\nThe city, which Mr. Putin has long claimed belongs to Russia, was relatively untouched by the fighting at the start of the war. But over the past six months, Russia has targeted grain silos and naval infrastructure there with drones and missiles in an attempt to undermine Ukraine’s relatively successful Black Sea export operations.\n\nThe attacks have also caused civilian casualties, either from direct targeting or falling debris. Earlier this month, a drone hit a residential building, killing 12 civilians. It took rescue workers several days to pull the bodies from the rubble, including those of babies and children.\n\nAnd last week, a missile hit the city while President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece were visiting, killing five people. Mr. Zelensky later told an Italian television station that the missile hit less than half a mile from the place where he was standing with Mr. Mitsotakis.\n\n“I don’t know who this hit was aimed at,” Mr. Zelensky said, adding that it was “incredible” that Russia could target the city while state leaders were visiting. The attack drew widespread condemnation from foreign leaders.\n\nReacting to Friday’s strikes on Odesa, Mr. Zelensky said in a video statement that the double-tap tactic made it “a very vile attack.” He added that rescuers were continuing to search for people under the rubble.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.3838544573102678,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Odesa region\n*   Odesa\n*   Russia\n*   Belgorod\n*   Belgorod region\n*   Syria\n*   Crimea\n*   Black Sea\n*   Greece\n*   Italy (implied by \"Italian television station\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-96.86981201171875}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.494700Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daeyYHvDRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3556},"candidatesTokenCount":70,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":70}],"promptTokenCount":882,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":882}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1039,"totalTokenCount":1991,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.609251+00:00"}

I am grateful to every soldier and commander - to all our warriors who ensure our defence and our frontline operations with their strength and resilience. And I am grateful to every enterprise here in Ukraine and to all joint ventures with partners for the continuous increase in our own supplies, for the much-needed weapons for our independence: drones, shells, artillery, and vehicles.\n\nThere was also a report on the construction of fortifications. More than 2,000 kilometers of tasks, shoring up the existing fortifications and creating new ones - at least three lines of our strength. They are designed to meet the threats. All the necessary resources have been deployed. The government, regional leaders and the military are personally responsible for the result. The result should speak for itself, with its reliability for every soldier.\n\nToday, Commander-in-Chief Syrskyy and Defence Minister Umerov made a separate report. They spoke about the current situation at the front and about planning our actions. There should be no place of rest for the occupier. Today we also discussed preparations for the next Ramstein meeting and the key points of our communication with partners regarding weapons and ammunition.\n\nChief of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine Budanov also delivered a separate report. Several issues were raised. First of all, Russia's military plans. Not only against our country, but also against other nations. The common task of the world now is to thwart this sick Putin's fantasy that he allegedly has time to continue the war. Perhaps he will intensify mobilisation after the imitation of \"elections\" now in March. Mobilisation of Russians. However, we must further limit the mobilisation of resources and finances, tightening the remnants of Russia's ties with the world even more severely. And everyone who values the lives of their people must do this - every leader. I am grateful to everyone who helps.\n\nToday I held several meetings with government officials, the financial and economic block of our government and the National Bank, to discuss the state of our financial system.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: In “For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy,” six Black British men participate in a group-therapy session punctuated by bursts of song. The show, written and directed by Ryan Calais Cameron, is a male-centric spin on Ntozake Shange’s 1976 work, “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf,” in which women of color recount their experiences of racism and gendered violence through performance poetry, music and dance.\n\n“For Black Boys” runs at the Garrick Theater in the West End through June 1. On a stage decked out in bright, blocky primary colors like a pop music video, the men — called Onyx, Pitch, Jet, Sable, Obsidian and Midnight, each a shade of black — bare their souls one by one. Every so often they morph into a ’90-style boy band, delivering neatly choreographed, crowd-pleasing renditions of R&B classics like Blackstreet’s “No Diggity” and India.Arie’s “Brown Skin.” (The set design is by Anna Reid, the choreography by Theophilus O. Bailey.)\n\nBanter is their love language. Jet (an engagingly plaintive Fela Lufadeju) is joshed for wearing chinos — a “white” affectation — prompting a spiky discussion on the vexed subject of “acting Black.” Gradually, deflection and bravado give way to introspection and insight as the men unpack the perniciousness of machismo in their lives: Jet recalls how his father refused to seek cancer treatment for fear of appearing unmanly; Sable, a self-styled Casanova (Albert Magashi, suitably strutting) concedes that insecurity might be driving his philandering ways; a flashback scene depicts Obsidian (Mohammed Mansaray) reluctantly engaging in senseless violence for street cred, with life-changing consequences.\n\nThe play ends with an upbeat mantra about keeping your chin up in the face of adversity. Its core message is about collective solidarity: By embracing emotional vulnerability and opening up to one another, young men can build support systems that will help them overcome life’s hardships. And the audience’s enthusiasm at the curtain call suggested to a sense of recognition: These sentiments rang true, and it meant something to see them conveyed from a West End stage.\n\nBut that easy accessibility comes at a price. The six characters feel like stock types, their respective travails a little too generic to be truly compelling — each existing, rather like pictures in a high-school textbook, to illustrate a trope. This is echoed in dialogue that relies heavily on melodramatic cliché (one character tells us his father was “destructive like a wrecking ball and I was the collateral damage”) and lingo taken from social sciences (“We’re not monoliths!”). Despite its exuberant energy, “For Black Boys” is ultimately somewhat two-dimensional.\n\nJust around the corner at @sohoplace, through May 4, “Red Pitch,” written by Tyrell Williams and directed by Daniel Bailey, tells a touching story of three 16-year-old aspiring soccer players from a London housing project. As they train for an upcoming, once-in-a-lifetime tryout with a professional club, the trio engage in the daft patter peculiar to adolescence: a fizzing, complex mix of insecurity, aggression and fraternal tenderness.\n\nBilal (Kedar Williams-Stirling) is ambitious and driven. Omz (Francis Lovehall) is hotheaded, prone to self-sabotage; he is often unlikable, but his flaws are all too human. The goalkeeper Joey (Emeka Sesay) has the funniest stage presence of the three, whether delivering wry quips, demonstratively folding and unfolding his arms, or slipping into his father’s Nigerian accent when he’s getting worked up. The boys’ teenage mannerisms — the moody sulks and flounces, the primal urgency with which they scoff snacks — are affectionately played for laughs.\n\nA municipal soccer pitch takes up the whole stage in Amelia Jane Hankin’s pleasing set. In contrast to another recent London soccer play, “Dear England,” where the sports choreography was less than convincing, the cast here is at ease performing sprints and passing drills. A series of dream sequences in which the boys imagine future sporting glory are strikingly rendered by spotlights, audiovisual effects conjuring camera flashes and the roar of a crowd, and the actors’ slow-motion movements. (The lighting is by Ali Hunter, the sound by Khalil Madovi.)\n\nThe poignancy of “Red Pitch” derives from the near-impossibility of a happy ending: In an ultracompetitive field, the three friends won’t all be signed by the club, and seem destined to go their separate ways. We are catching them at a specific, fleeting moment in time, on the threshold of the next phase of life. The line between sentimentality and schmaltz can be fine, but Williams’s taut script treads it nimbly. (The play’s running time is exactly 90 minutes, the length of a regulation soccer match — a nice touch.)\n\n“For Black Boys” and “Red Pitch” are both earnest, uplifting evocations of male camaraderie by emerging British playwrights; both also achieved notable word-of-mouth success during runs in small theaters before transferring to the West End. But they showcase markedly different storytelling styles: “For Black Boys,” with its didactic enumeration of societal ills, has the feel of a PowerPoint presentation; its bracing directness befits the urgency of its message, but as a piece of art it never quite transports us. By contrast, “Red Pitch” draws us in with an absorbing — if conventional linear — narrative, and wears its wisdom lightly. The first is mere performance, the latter true theater.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.389773461126512,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1624,"startIndex":1378,"uri":"https://reviewvalue.com/lifestyle/on-london-stages-uplifting-tales-of-black-masculinity/"},{"endIndex":2356,"startIndex":1656,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":2870,"startIndex":2407,"uri":"https://show-news.space/news/theater/"},{"endIndex":3478,"startIndex":2910,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":3735,"startIndex":3509,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/25/on-london-stages-uplifting-tales-of-black-masculinity/"},{"endIndex":3996,"startIndex":3781,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/25/on-london-stages-uplifting-tales-of-black-masculinity/"},{"endIndex":4575,"startIndex":4025,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":5071,"startIndex":4800,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/25/on-london-stages-uplifting-tales-of-black-masculinity/"},{"endIndex":5381,"startIndex":5104,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/25/on-london-stages-uplifting-tales-of-black-masculinity/"},{"endIndex":5933,"startIndex":5415,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":6203,"startIndex":5965,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/25/on-london-stages-uplifting-tales-of-black-masculinity/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Garrick Theater\n*   West End\n*   @sohoplace\n*   London"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-74.08297729492188}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.661169Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4dabGtKMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4710},"candidatesTokenCount":31,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":31}],"promptTokenCount":1208,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1208}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1578,"totalTokenCount":2817,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.434485+00:00"}

The attack, claimed to have been carried out by IS militants,&#160;resulted in the deaths of approximately 140 people and left over 180 wounded.&#160;\n\nAl-Azaim endorsed the targeting of Russian civilians, justifying it as retaliation for the deaths of IS members and their families in Russian military operations in Syria.&#160;\n\nThis appeared to echo IS's official line on 23 March, when a statement by the group indicated that the attack was revenge against Russia, without saying over which issue.\n\nThe latest al-Azaim statement also argued that Russian citizens' tax contributions facilitated their military's actions against IS in Syria, suggesting that these citizens thus tacitly supported such operations.\n\nIt is probable that al-Azaim's justification for civilian killings is meant to convey the message to IS supporters that killing the citizens of any country participating in the war against IS anywhere is warranted.\n\nA central theme in the statement was challenging the Taliban's alleged suggestions that ISKP receives covert support from Pakistan and Tajikistan.\n\nIt countered that if ISKP had alliances with Pakistan or Tajikistan, it would not target those countries. And yet, it continued, the group has carried out major recent attacks in Pakistan, citing a July 2023 suicide bombing in Bajaur and an IED attack in the same region in January.\n\nAl-Azaim also highlighted the 2022 ISKP missile attack on Tajikistan's border forces from Afghan soil as contradictory to the Taliban's claims.\n\nMoreover, the statement rejected the assertion from Taliban supporters that ISKP serves US interests. It cited the death of US soldiers in an ISKP suicide attack at Kabul Airport in August 2021, along with the pivotal role of US forces in dismantling ISKP's territorial grip in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, as evidence refuting these claims.\n\nSource: Telegram messaging service in Pashto 1200 GMT 25 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8530535016741071,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Moscow\n*   Syria\n*   Afghanistan\n*   China\n*   Iran\n*   Russia\n*   Pakistan\n*   north-western Pakistan\n*   Tajikistan\n*   Bajaur\n*   Kabul Airport\n*   Kabul (implied by Kabul Airport)\n*   US (United States)\n*   Kunar (province)\n*   Nangarhar (province)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-83.5992431640625}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.798367Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daZ_dMMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2578},"candidatesTokenCount":98,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":98}],"promptTokenCount":679,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":679}],"thoughtsTokenCount":961,"totalTokenCount":1738,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.186589+00:00"}

They want war - and they are striking not only our people, not only our cities and communities. Russia is now striking at everyone in the world who seeks peace. It is a strike against Ukraine. It is a strike against Europe. And it is also a strike by Russia against President Trump, and against other global actors,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address.\n\nZelensky noted that other Ukrainian cities are also suffering from Russia's deliberate strikes on civilian infrastructure and called on the international community to take \"strong steps\" to \"compel\" Russian leader Vladimir Putin to end the war.\n\n\"Russia kills every day.

We urge Hungary to further refrain from unfriendly actions and instead engage in constructive dialogue, for which Ukraine remains ready,\" Sybiha said on X in English.\n\nEarlier Sybiha lambasted his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto for banning Brovdi, while Magyar himself took to Facebook to respond to the ban. In particular, he accused Szijjarto of being \"complicit in the multiplication of blood money\" by defending Russian oil supplies and told him to \"shove your sanctions and restrictions on visiting Hungary up your ass\".\n\nThe story took another twist after Polish Foreign Minister voiced support for Brovdi.\n\n\"While Russian missiles rain death on Kyiv, Hungary bans a brave ethnic Hungarian who dares to fight for Ukraine's freedom. Commander Magyar: if you need some R&R and Hungary won't let you in, please be our guest in Poland,\" Sikorski said on X in English.\n\n\"Endangering Hungary's energy security has nothing to do with the freedom of Ukraine!\" Szijjarto retorted.\n\nSybiha welcomed Sikorski's statement.\n\n\"Well said @sikorskiradek.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The Polish leader made the call as he and Tusk visited Washington to mark their country's 25th anniversary of joining the now 32-member transatlantic military alliance. It was a historic step into the West after breaking free from Moscow’s sphere of influence after decades of communist rule.\n\n“Russia's aggression against Ukraine really demonstrated that United States is and should remain the security leader,” Duda said. “But other allies must take more responsibility for the security of the alliance as a whole. Two percent was good 10 years ago. Now 3% is required in response for the full scale war launched by Russia right beyond NATO's eastern border.”\n\nBiden called the U.S. commitment to Poland ironclad and marveled at Poland's current defense spending and thanked the leaders for taking in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees after Russia launched the February 2022 invasion. But he did not directly address Duda's call for NATO members to ramp up spending.\n\n“When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful,” Biden said, recalling the words of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright upon Poland's accession into the alliance. ”I believed that then and I believe that now. And we see it with Polish and American troops serving side by side with NATO on the eastern flank, including in Poland.\"\n\nBiden administration officials, however, suggested ahead of the meeting that Duda’s call to raise the defense spending target for NATO countries may be, at least for the time being, overly ambitious.\n\n\"I think the first step is to get every country meeting the 2% threshold, and we’ve seen improvement of that,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. “But I think that’s the first step before we start talking about an additional proposal.”\n\nThe visit also comes amid a standoff in Washington between Biden, a Democrat, and House Republicans on Ukraine funding. House Republicans have blocked a $118 billion bipartisan package that includes $60 billion in Ukraine funding, as well as funds for Israel, Taiwan and U.S. border security.\n\nThe Pentagon announced Tuesday it will rush about $300 million in weapons to Ukraine after finding some cost savings in its contracts. It’s the Biden administration's first announced security package for Ukraine since December, when it acknowledged it was out of replenishment funds.\n\nBiden said the funding is not nearly enough, and pointed to Poland's own history to argue for further further funding.\n\n“We must act before it literally is too late.” Biden said. “Because as Poland remembers, Russia won’t stop at Ukraine. Putin will keep going, putting Europe, the United States and the entire free world at risk.”\n\nDuda met with U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday before the White House meeting. and offered a blunt warning: If the U.S. does not deliver military aid to halt Russia’s advance, Poland will be on the frontlines of a conflict that involves European and American troops.\n\n“Financial support for Ukraine is cheap if you take into account what other forms of support would be needed if it comes to war and to an attack on NATO countries,” Duda said.\n\nTusk after the White House meeting called on Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to pass Ukraine funding, warning him that inaction could “cost thousands of human lives in Ukraine.”\n\n“This is not some political skirmish that has significance only here, on the American political stage,” Tusk said.\n\nJohnson, who was among the lawmakers who met with Duda, said in a statement, that “America must remain united with our friends against those who threaten our security.”\n\nBiden informed the leaders that the U.S. plans to move forward with a foreign military financing loan that will help Poland purchase 96 Apache helicopters. The State Department approved the sale last year.\n\nThe visit offered Biden another opportunity to showcase how his view of NATO contrasts with that of the likely 2024 Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has said that when he was president, he warned NATO allies that he “would encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to countries that are “delinquent” in meeting the alliance's defense spending target. White House press secretary\n\nFear is deepening across Europe about Ukraine's fate as its ammunition stocks run low and as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in Ukraine, reversing its weak military performance at the start of a war launched in February 2022.\n\nTusk said that despite political divisions in Poland the country is unified on the issues of security, Russia and Ukraine and wishes the same were true for other allies.\n\n“When we Poles started on our road to the West, Pope John Paul II said there could be no just Europe without an independent Poland,” Tusk said “And today, I would say there can be no safe Europe without a strong Poland. And of course I would also say there could be no just Europe without a free and independent Ukraine.”\n\nIt is the first time in a quarter-century for a Polish president and prime minister to be in Washington at the same time and the first for both leaders to be welcomed at the White House at the same time, according to Polish media. The gesture by the bitter political rivals is widely seen as an acknowledgment of the seriousness of this historical moment, with Russian strength growing as that of Ukraine wanes.\n\nDuda, aligned with a national conservative party that lost power last year, used his power to delay the transition to a new government under Tusk by weeks.\n\nTusk won power after promising to restore democratic norms that eroded under the last government and Poland has been hailed by many across Europe as one of the only places where growing authoritarianism has been reversed in recent times.\n\n“No matter matter who wins the election in our country we treat our obligation seriously, more than anyone else in Europe,” Tusk said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The announcement by the West African nation’s military junta on Saturday came after meetings last week with a delegation from Washington and the top U.S. commander for Africa, Gen. Michael E. Langley. The move is in keeping with a recent pattern by countries in the Sahel region, an arid area south of the Sahara, of breaking ties with Western countries. Increasingly, they are partnering with Russia instead.\n\nAmerican officials also voiced alarm in the meetings about several other issues, including whether Niger’s military government was nearing a deal to give Iran access to Niger’s vast uranium reserves, a concern that was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNiger’s rejection of military ties with the United States follows the withdrawal from Niger of troops from France, the former colonial power that, for the past decade, has led foreign counterterrorism efforts against jihadist groups in West Africa, but which has lately been perceived as a pariah in the region.\n\n“The American presence in the territory of the Republic of Niger is illegal,” Niger’s military spokesman, Col. Amadou Abdramane, said on national television. He added that the U.S. military presence “violates all the constitutional and democratic rules, which would require the sovereign people — notably through its elected officials — to be consulted on the installation of a foreign army on its territory.”\n\nMatthew Miller, the chief State Department spokesman, said it was in touch with the ruling military junta, known as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland, or CNSP, about the move.\n\n“We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP’s trajectory,” he said in a message on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMany of the Americans posted to Niger are stationed at U.S. Air Base 201, a six-year-old, $110 million installation in the country’s desert north. But since the military coup that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum and installed the junta last July, the troops there have been inactive, with most of their drones grounded.\n\nBecause of the coup, the United States had to suspend security operations and development aid to Niger.\n\nMr. Bazoum, the country’s elected president, is still under arrest, eight months after he was ousted. But the United States had wanted to maintain its partnership with the country.\n\nA senior U.S. military official said on Sunday there had been no immediate changes to the status of about 1,000 American military personnel stationed in the country. The Pentagon has continued to conduct surveillance drone flights from Air Base 201 to protect U.S. troops and alert the Nigerien authorities if the flights detected an imminent terrorist threat.\n\n“The canceling of the security agreement is not quite a direct expulsion of the American military presence, as happened with the French,” said Hannah Rae Armstrong, an analyst focused on peace and security in the Sahel. “It’s more likely an aggressive negotiation tactic to extract more benefits from cooperating with the Americans.”\n\nIn Niger, the decision was couched in terms of “sovereignty” — rhetoric meant to resonate with the public.\n\n“The goal of American policy is not to help fight armed groups, but to maintain control and counter the growing influence in the region of countries such as Russia, China and Turkey,” Abdoulaye Sissoko, a Nigerien columnist, wrote on a popular Nigerien news site. “There is no public evidence that American bases in Niger have proven useful.”\n\nAmerican officials say they have tried for months to prevent a formal break in relations with Niger’s junta.\n\nThe new U.S. ambassador to Niger, Kathleen FitzGibbon, one of Washington’s top Africa specialists, has held regular discussions with the junta since taking office at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn a trip to Niger in December, Molly Phee, an assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, said the United States intended to resume security and development cooperation with Niger, even as she called for a swift transition to civilian rule and the release of Mr. Bazoum.\n\nBut the Pentagon has been planning for the worst-case contingencies if the talks failed. The Defense Department has been discussing establishing new drone bases with several coastal West African countries as backups to the base in Niger, which is landlocked. Talks are still in the early stages, military officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.\n\nJ. Peter Pham, a former special U.S. envoy to the Sahel, said Washington will “have to wait and see” how Niger will implement the new approach.\n\n“The potential fallout goes beyond the not insignificant damage to counterterrorism and intelligence efforts that loss of access to the bases in Niger entail,” Mr. Pham said, “but to the broader damage to America’s standing on the continent.”\n\nThe Biden administration formally acknowledged last October what most countries had declared months previously: that the military takeover in Niger last July was a coup.\n\nBiden administration officials had sidestepped that declaration for weeks because the word “coup” has major policy implications. Congress has mandated that the United States must halt all economic and military aid to any government installed by a military coup until democracy is restored.\n\nBut the administration finally concluded that efforts to restore Niger’s democratically elected government to power had failed and that aid that had not already been restricted would be cut off. State Department officials said nearly $200 million in aid that was temporarily paused in August would be suspended. About $442 million in trade and agricultural assistance will also be suspended.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration had been holding out increasingly dim hopes that the military junta would reverse its takeover and agree to restore a democratically elected government.\n\nThe junta’s announcement is part of a major change in dynamic between the country and its erstwhile Western partners.\n\n“It reflects a real shift in the balance of power,” Ms. Armstrong said. “Over the past decade, Niger has repeatedly pleaded for security assistance and aid. Now it’s the U.S. that finds itself in a position of being asked to beg to keep forces and bases in the country.”\n\nThe entire military approach in the Sahel needs to be reformed, said El Hadj Djitteye, director of the Timbuktu Center for Strategic Studies on the Sahel, a Mali-based think tank.\n\n“Western governments including the United States and France have failed to work closely with African governments and civilian populations in economic and military development,” Mr. Djitteye said. This, he said, has fed the widely held perception that their presence in the region is an extension of “the old colonial pattern which puts colonial interests first and African interests a distant second.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.003192766974954,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   West Africa\n*   Washington\n*   Africa\n*   Sahel region\n*   Sahara\n*   Russia\n*   Niger\n*   Iran\n*   France\n*   Niamey\n*   U.S. Air Base 201\n*   China\n*   Turkey\n*   Mali\n*   Timbuktu"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-85.2713851928711}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.162511Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4dac_1CZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5869},"candidatesTokenCount":85,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":85}],"promptTokenCount":1407,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1407}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1112,"totalTokenCount":2604,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.446096+00:00"}

Artillery without a round inside is a halfway solution. Just like hardware that doesn't come with smart enough software,\" he said.\n\nTaavi Veskimagi, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Estonian Defence and Aerospace Industry Association, said in a panel discussion that Estonia's defence spending of 3 percent of GDP is not enough and will probably grow to at least 5 percent in the near term.\n\n\"I'm more than sure that we're going to see a significantly higher contribution than 3 percent, at least 5 percent, over the next five years to achieve sufficient deterrence,\" Veskimagi said. It will be then necessary that everything we can produce locally in order to strengthen our defence capability is produced here as well, by our own industries, he added.\n\nVeskimagi said defence spending rising to 5 percent of GDP would be an opportunity for Estonian defence industry companies.\n\n\"What will matter is how Estonian companies will furnish this 5 percent, because if all that money - 5 percent of our GDP - goes abroad, it will already be a problem in terms of the foreign trade balance.\" To mitigate this, Veskimagi says, everything that is possible must be produced and done locally in Estonia. \"This is necessary both to increase defence capabilities and for economic development, to maintain and create jobs.\"\n\nBrig. Gen.

Now, we train tactical operators in the defence forces who can handle basic operation of equipment because all training exercises include components of digital warfare. It makes no sense to establish an engineering course at the Estonian Military Academy in a situation where engineering is taught in five universities in Estonia. Therefore, our strategy is to incorporate engineers into the needs of the defence forces for a fixed term so that they return to civilian jobs with the experience gained and continue to contribute to the next technological developments there. This is human resource development that goes in long cycles,\" Karus said.\n\nCGI is a global software company with operations in 40 countries, whose national branches have a high degree of overlap with NATO member states.

And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace,\" he said.\n\nOn 17 August, Zelensky Zelensky took part in a meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing ahead of his talks with Trump and said that Ukraine-Russia talks to end the war should take into account the current line of contact while any territorial issues can be discussed only with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a trilateral meeting involving the US.\n\nConcern in Ukraine ahead of talks with Trump\n\nA number of media outlets, including the ZN.ua website, republished a Bild article according to which Zelensky will first meet Trump one-on-one and only later they will be joined by European leaders - UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\n\"One cannot rule out an escalation in the White House,\" ZN.ua warned, referring to the Zelensky-Trump row in February of this year.\n\n\"It seems that the Ukrainian president will have to make some concessions under pressure from circumstances,\" the TSN.ua website said in an article headlined \"A new scandal or step to ending the war: what one should expect from the Trump-Zelensky meeting\".\n\nThe website noted that a year ago Zelensky said that Ukraine \"will never agree to any option of frozen conflict\", while yesterday the Ukrainian leader said that \"real negotiations\" can start \"where the current line of contact is\".\n\nTSN.ua also noted that Zelensky will be accompanied by \"a powerful support group\" of the European leaders.\n\nUkrainians welcome participation of Europeans in Washington talks\n\nThe Glavred website described the participation of European leaders in the talks as \"a European landing operation in Washington\".\n\n\"European leaders are concerned that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may not get from the US leader the same friendly treatment as Vladimir Putin did. Therefore, the EU decided to bolster Kyiv's chances at the meeting,\" the Telegraf website commented.\n\n\"European leaders are going to strengthen Volodymyr Zelensky's delegation in the USA,\" the Censor.net website said on Facebook.\n\nFormer MP Boryslav Bereza hailed the fact that Zelensky will be supported by \"adults\" at the talks. However, he warned that Zelensky should not take to the White House his chief of staff Andriy Yermak.\n\n\"Yermak must not attend this meeting. He is disrespected in the White House and irritates US politicians with his primitivism,\" Bereza said on Facebook.\n\nPundit and army serviceman Kyrylo Sazonov predicted that the talks with Trump would be \"very difficult\".\n\n\"This meeting is more important than the Trump-Putin talks. Good luck, Mr president. You definitely need it now,\" he said on Facebook.\n\nUkraine's long-range cruise missile\n\nA photo of Ukraine's long-range cruise missiles posted on Facebook by AP photo correspondent Efrem Lukatsky (Yefrem Lukatskyy) has gone viral on social networks and made the headlines in mainstream media.\n\n\"Ukrainian-made over 3,000 km range Flamingo missiles, which were launched into serial production, are seen in a workshop of one of the country's leading Fire Point defence company in an undisclosed location in Ukraine on Thursday, 14 August, 2025,\" Lukatsky said in English.\n\nThe specialist Defense Express website said that the Flamingo is an \"FP-5 missile made by Milanion Group\".\n\n\"Its operational range and warhead are twice as powerful as those of the Tomahawk and, most importantly, it is meant for serial production,\" Defence Express commented.\n\nIt noted that the warhead weighs about 1 tonne.\n\nOvernight attacks\n\nAt least four civilians were killed and 18 injured as a result of Russian ballistic missile and drone strikes on Kharkiv, regional governor Oleh Synyehubov reported on Telegram.\n\nAccording to the governor, four Russian strike drones hit a five-storey block of flats.\n\n\"A total of six blocks of flats and 15 cars were damaged,\" he added.\n\nThe pooled TV service indicated that the number of casualties may increase given that \"a lot of people are still under the rubble\".\n\nThe TV also reported a ballistic missile strike on Sumy Region.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: “All I could see were sparks in my eyes,” said one of the soldiers, a sergeant, recounting how the pursuing drone blew up, leaving him and his team wounded but somehow still alive. He asked to be identified only by his first name, Oleksandr, according to military protocol.\n\nFighting on the plain in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, where Oleksandr’s vehicle was hit earlier this year, has raged for 10 months now in two phases: first with Ukrainian forces on the offense, and now on defense, as Russia escalates attacks on the area where Ukraine gained ground in last summer’s counteroffensive.\n\nMilitary analysts have described Ukraine’s strategy as “hold, build and strike” — holding the line in the country’s southeast, replenishing its units with fresh troops and hitting back with long-range drones attacks on oil refineries and military logistics targets inside Russia.\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, this has meant defending an area created by last summer’s counteroffensive, a 10-mile-deep semicircle that presses into Russian-held territory, forming a bulge. Soldiers describe ruined villages, trenches and fields that are a moonscape of shell craters.\n\nAt the southern tip of the semicircle lies the village of Robotyne. Ukraine recaptured it last summer, in the high-water mark of a counteroffensive that not only failed to achieve a breakthrough, but left the Russians in a strong enough position to start pushing back across the southern front.\n\nUkrainian forces occupying that bulge in the front line can be attacked from three sides, creating a dilemma: Abandoning that pocket would ease the pressure on them, but it would also signal a symbolic setback in the war, losing territory they gained last year at a high cost in casualties and destroyed weaponry.\n\nInterviewed last week, soldiers who recently fought there described small sways in the front in both directions, and being badly outgunned by Russian artillery. Overall along the frontline, Russia is firing seven times as many artillery shells as Ukraine, General Ivan Havryliuk, a deputy minister of defense, told Ukrainian media on Monday.\n\nAmerican weaponry that had been donated for the counteroffensive last year, including Stryker armored vehicles, has proved useful in protecting soldiers from these barrages now as they fight defensively.\n\nBut U.S. politics now threaten the supply of arms. A package worth about $60 billion in military and financial assistance has been stalled in Congress for months over objections from some Republicans. The Biden administration last week announced it would send $300 million in stopgap military assistance using funds remaining from previously approved aid.\n\nRussian forces attacked the pocket around Robotyne and areas nearby nine times over the past day, the general staff headquarters said on Tuesday. When the Ukrainians captured the village last year, they pierced a main Russian anti-tank defensive line; now the Russians are trying to push them back and fill in that gap.\n\nLike Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Robotyne, which had a prewar population of about 500 people, is now just ruins. Throughout the war, American officials have repeatedly raised concerns that Ukraine was holding out too long in defending such places, committing soldiers and ammunition to cling to devastated towns with little strategic value.\n\nBut for Ukraine, the area around Robotyne remains worth fighting for, at least for now.\n\n“At some point, symbolic becomes strategic,” Yurii Sak, a former adviser to the minister of defense, said of the fighting. Defending the gains of the offensive, he said, is “important for morale, it’s important for the support of the population, it’s important for the inner belief in our potential to win.”\n\nThe combat is also more costly in casualties for the attacking Russians than the Ukrainians in their defensive positions, Mr. Sak said. “As long as that calculus continues, it supports holding the ground,” he said. “It’s war, so casualties are inevitable on both sides.”\n\nRussia is now on the offensive along the entire frontline, which stretches in a 600-mile-long crescent from the Russian border in northeastern Ukraine to the southern Dnipro River. The Kremlin’s military has been using its advantage in ammunition, manpower and aviation.\n\nRussia has swelled the ranks of its army by deploying squads of former convicts. It is buying artillery shells, missiles and exploding drones from North Korea and Iran to help replenish its supplies. Its planes avoid Ukrainian air defenses by dropping bombs from a safe distance that glide to their targets.\n\nJust this year, Russia has dropped more than 3,500 glide bombs, Ukraine’s military said. Moscow’s electronic warfare instruments jam signals and scramble coordinates for Ukraine’s satellite-guided weapons.\n\nThe result has been a grinding advance that in February pushed Ukraine out of the small city of Avdiivka in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Since then, Russia has been attacking with a combination of ground assaults and aerial bombing at seven points along the front, according to Ukraine’s general staff headquarters.\n\nIn the northeast, Russian forces are pushing through pine forests toward the city of Kupiansk on the Oskil River, seeking to reverse gains Ukraine made in a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022.\n\nIn the Donbas, a region of rolling hills dotted with coal mines and factories, Russia has been pressing along four lines of attack, seeking to exploit openings created by capturing Avdiivka. Ukrainian forces say they are holding defensive positions to the west of the city, though Russia has captured several small villages as it tries to advance.\n\nNear the southern city of Kherson, Russia has been assaulting a Ukrainian outpost across the Dnipro River, on the eastern bank, in an area otherwise controlled by Russia. Russian forces assaulted the position three times on Monday, the Ukrainian military said.\n\nThe position there is resupplied by boat and, like the bulge in the lines around Robotyne, it is precarious.\n\nThese fights are worthwhile, Ukrainian officials have said, because they cost Russia tens of thousands of soldiers killed and wounded, but there is skepticism in Washington.\n\n“I understand the administration has been frustrated,” Evelyn Farkas, director of the McCain Institute, said, referring to the Biden administration.\n\n“It’s unclear whether military decisions are purely military or influenced by political pressure or even direction,” she said.\n\nAt the training for Ukrainian troops fighting in the semicircular area near Robotyne, soldiers noted one advantage to the shift to a defensive strategy: fewer casualties. Russians now must leave their trenches to attack, while the Ukrainians are fighting from the cover of their positions.\n\nPulling back, said a private, also named Oleksandr, would merely leave Ukrainian troops fighting in other positions in similar conditions. “You need to defend every meter,” he said.\n\nStill, it is a fierce fight in the south, over a landscape of open fields, muddy roads, ruins of farmhouses and countless blown-up vehicles, facing Russian forces on three sides.\n\nUkrainians have been fighting in the area long enough to give the positions they are defending nicknames like The Wheel, Silicon and Tank Trench.\n\nRussian reconnaissance drones continually fly overhead, directing artillery or mortar fire on the soldiers. Aerial bombardments are common.\n\nSmall drones rigged with explosives and cameras buzz in regularly, chasing cars and sometimes people. The one that flew into Sergeant Oleksandr’s armored personnel carrier in January wounded everyone inside, but all survived. Last week, he was training to return to the fighting in the same area.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.2951759338378905,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Zaporizhzhia region\n*   Russia\n*   Robotyne\n*   Bakhmut\n*   Avdiivka\n*   Washington (referring to the US capital/government)\n*   North Korea\n*   Iran\n*   Moscow\n*   Donbas region\n*   Kupiansk\n*   Oskil River\n*   Kherson\n*   Dnipro River"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-129.51759338378906}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.433977Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"at4dabm-GuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6528},"candidatesTokenCount":100,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":100}],"promptTokenCount":1568,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1568}],"thoughtsTokenCount":993,"totalTokenCount":2661,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:51.479941+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: For most of the past 120 years, the walrus has sat in the middle of the Natural History Gallery at the Horniman Museum and Gardens. The museum displays the collection of Frederick Horniman, a wealthy tea trader who lived in Victorian England.\n\nThe gallery, which in addition to the walrus holds other taxidermy animals, skeletons and insects, is being shuttered while the museum redevelops the space, with a focus on “environmental sustainability and a commitment to fighting the climate emergency,” according to the museum’s website. (The rest of the museum, which also includes a large collection of musical instruments and an aquarium, will remain open.)\n\nWhen the gallery reopens, in 2026, visitors will be able to see the walrus in the same spot where they left him — sitting prominently in the middle of the room atop a fake iceberg, said Louis Buckley, a senior curator at the museum. The collection will include more context about how Mr. Horniman came to own the walrus. The museum’s website notes that Mr. Horniman’s wealth was “reliant on the exploitation of people living in the British Empire.”\n\n“It’s an expression in many ways of the British Empire and its relationship with the colonies and Canada in particular,” Mr. Buckley said.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Mr. Horniman amassed a collection of ethnographic objects, natural history specimens and musical instruments. When his collection grew too large to fit in his home, he commissioned architects to build a museum, which opened in 1901.\n\nIn the renovated gallery, the walrus will “encapsulate a lot of different themes we are exploring,” Mr. Buckley said. Other than a closer look at how Mr. Horniman’s objects arrived in the museum, climate change and humans’ relationship to nature will also be explored.\n\nThe walrus is the undeniable showstopper of the collection. It’s the only item in the gallery that’s not in a glass case.\n\nLooking at it, however, might make a visitor feel a bit odd — as though something’s off.\n\n“People describe it as a bit too large,” Mr. Buckley said.\n\nLive walruses have skin folds and wrinkles. The one at the museum does not, though the marks of where those skin folds would be are visible. The walrus, Mr. Buckley said, “is fully plumped up, quite a bit larger than it would have been in life.”\n\nWhoever originally stuffed the animal probably had never seen a walrus, Mr. Buckley said. After all, he added, “they’re difficult animals to observe up close.”\n\nMr. Horniman bought the walrus around 1886 from an exhibition in London. The walrus itself is probably from the Hudson Bay area of Canada, Mr. Buckley said, although it’s unknown who hunted and killed it.\n\nOn Sunday, the overriding mood at the museum was one of enthusiasm and walrus appreciation. Against the sounds of squealing — and sometimes crying — children on a rare sunny March day, visitors said they had made a pilgrimage that day specifically to say goodbye.\n\n“We came to greet the walrus,” said Julia King, one of the visitors. It was her first time seeing the walrus in person. “He’s magnificent,” she said.\n\nMs. King said she enjoyed looking at the absurd things in life, and the walrus lived up to her expectations.\n\n“He’s obviously the star of Southeast London,” said Sian Thomas, another visitor, who said she found the overstuffed animal important as a way to understand how we look at the world differently than people did in Victorian times, and how our scientific understanding has evolved.\n\nAs visitors passed by the walrus on Sunday, many of them took photos, explained the animal to their children and marveled at its size. The walrus’s total weight is unknown, but it takes at least five people to move him, Mr. Buckley said.\n\n“I did not expect it to be so big,” said Kasia Kaniuka, a Londoner who was visiting the museum with her boyfriend because they had heard the gallery was closing. “It’s quite overwhelming.”\n\nFor Josh Alford, the gallery’s closure was also the main reason to visit on Sunday. He came to see the walrus from East London. “I expected it to be like a seal size,” Mr. Alford said. “That looks like a horse, to be honest.” (He was quick to add that the animal did look “cute enough to hug.”)\n\nSome said they were sad the walrus would be going away for a while, many of them citing it as a family favorite. Others, who had no idea of the impending closure, were pleased with their serendipitous timing.\n\n“I’m gutted,” said Kara Tritton, who grew up in the area and still lives there. She said she remembered seeing the walrus for the first time as a child, and the impression it made on her. Through the museum, she said, she also felt connected to her great-grandparents, who were local residents and who had most likely visited the walrus as well.\n\n“I absolutely had to come today,” she said. “I’ll miss him. Two years will be a long time.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.08985216477338,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Horniman Museum and Gardens\n*   Natural History Gallery (within the Horniman Museum)\n*   Victorian England\n*   British Empire\n*   Canada\n*   London\n*   Hudson Bay area (of Canada)\n*   Southeast London\n*   East London"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-74.10994720458984}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.435236Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"at4daaTIGsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4028},"candidatesTokenCount":68,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":68}],"promptTokenCount":1118,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1118}],"thoughtsTokenCount":619,"totalTokenCount":1805,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.39692+00:00"}

Temperatures are forecast to reach 113 degrees Fahrenheit, far above the 90-degree highs typically experienced in the dry season from December to March.\n\nOfficials did not say how long the schools would remain closed. But the health and education ministries said in a joint statement that “any school that will be found opened during this time will have its registration withdrawn.”\n\nParents have also been urged to stop their children from playing outside and to monitor them for signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.\n\nThe sweltering temperatures in South Sudan, whose tropical climate includes both dry and wet seasons, are interrupting the onset of the academic year. Most schools in the East African nation, especially those outside Juba, the capital, are congested and underfunded and lack infrastructure such as air-conditioners to help withstand such heat.\n\nSouth Sudan is highly exposed to severe climatic events, including droughts, floods and rising temperatures. These changes have exacerbated displacement, food insecurity and communal conflict in the nation of 11 million people, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011.\n\nThe heat wave is also expected to put pressure on the country’s nascent health care system, which has long grappled with limited financing and worker shortages.\n\nSouth Sudan is not the only African country where extreme weather events have precipitated school shutdowns. In 2022, Malawi’s government shortened the school day in the southern Shire Valley because of rising temperatures. And in Uganda, severe floods have repeatedly forced the government to close schools over the years.\n\nYet in South Sudan, conflict, a worsening humanitarian crisis and a tense political environment have made it even harder to mitigate the turmoil of climate change.\n\nSouth Sudan’s civil war has claimed the lives of some 400,000 people and displaced millions more since 2013. And although a tenuous political agreement has held between the country’s feuding leaders over the past few years, a growing humanitarian crisis and deadly rifts among forces within the ruling alliance have added to the uncertainty over whether repeatedly postponed elections will take place this year.\n\nAt the same time, the war in neighboring Sudan has forced the return of nearly half a million South Sudanese who had fled the conflict in their own country. Many have come back to towns and villages where their homes and farms have been pillaged and are finding it hard to rebuild their lives.\n\nEmmanuel Lokosang, the head teacher at Jada Jedid Nursery and Primary School in the capital, said he hoped the weather would cool down soon so that students could resume classes.\n\n“Juba is really hot,” Mr. Lokosang, whose school has over 600 students, said in a telephone interview Wednesday morning.\n\nHe added: “We hope they don’t delay for long, because the more we delay, the more it affects the academic calendar and how we can recover the curriculum.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.030730170172614,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   South Sudan\n*   Juba\n*   Sudan\n*   Malawi\n*   Shire Valley\n*   Uganda"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-75.13701629638672}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.577260Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daeydI8CSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2653},"candidatesTokenCount":37,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":37}],"promptTokenCount":636,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":636}],"thoughtsTokenCount":769,"totalTokenCount":1442,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.904053+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Kamran Khan said newly formed governments in Punjab and Sindh have completed the first month after their formation and noted that Maryam Nawaz has taken over the chief ministership of Punjab for the first time, while Murad Ali Shah has become the chief minister of Sindh for the third time and has been working in the province since the last eight years. However, he added, there is a huge difference between the performance of these two governments.\n\nKhan said on one hand, Nawaz has been very active in the province and has announced several new projects but on the other, Shah has remained \"absent from the scene\" throughout the month. He noted Nawaz has been visiting public places and trying to solve the issues of the people.\n\nKhan played a video report on Nawaz and Shah's activities during the past month. The report noted Nawaz has announced low-cost houses for people with low income, e-bikes and urban bus projects for the youth, and has decided to provide ration to the poor during Ramadan (month of fasting for Muslims). The report further said Nawaz has been overseeing all these projects and calling meetings on dozens of issues. It added she announced \"safe city projects\" for 18 cities of Punjab would be completed in the next three months and has launched an overseas property transfer service for the Pakistanis living abroad.\n\nThe report noted Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah visited south Karachi once in the last one month and inspected the condition of the rainwater drainage system there. It said apart from this, Shah was not seen in any public place. It further said meeting of the cabinet was held only once but an agreement for the Karachi safe city project was approved after a long wait of 16 years.\n\nScandal surrounding new federal minister\n\nKhan said in the initial weeks of the new government in the centre, a scandal has surfaced which has created upheaval in the highly reputed Aitchison College of Lahore. He mentioned Punjab Governor Baligh ur Rehman, who is the chairperson of the board of governors of the college, ordered waiver of college fees and fine for two sons of the newly appointed federal minister Ahad Cheema. He added due to this, college principal Michael A Thomson resigned from his post. He noted in a letter, Thomson wrote that he would leave on 1 April and not play any role in management of the upcoming admissions.\n\nKhan mentioned after the principal's resignation, Syed Babar Ali (senior member of the college's board of governors) also resigned in protest over political interference in the affairs of the college.\n\nTax reforms\n\nKhan said a \"historic step\" is about to be taken by bringing the retail sector under the tax net as well as all other sectors which are currently not under the tax net. He mentioned traders in major cities would be registered through the Tajir Dost (trader-friendly) scheme. He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently claimed 14,000bn rupees ($50bn) can be collected in taxes if the tax net is expanded to all the sectors.\n\nKhan spoke with Zeeshan Merchant, an expert on tax affairs, and asked him whether the new scheme is implementable. Merchant said the focus these days is on \"digitisation\" and several changes are being made for this purpose. He added the question is whether any discussion was held with the traders for whom this scheme has been announced. He recalled similar schemes in past had failed and enforcement is the biggest issue due to which tax revenue has not increased in the past years. He was of the view that the scheme should be discussed with the stakeholders before its implementation and suggested that the system should be simplified as much as possible.\n\nCrime rate in Sindh\n\nKhan said the crime rate has \"hugely increased\" in the interior Sindh due to which freight containers cannot pass through the highways in the province and everything that needs to be transported upcountry remains stuck in Karachi. He added robbers loot trucks, freight containers and oil tankers on the main highways connecting Sindh and Punjab. He noted cases of shooting, robberies and kidnapping of transporters for ransom have increased in the last few months. He insisted a decisive operation against dacoits is necessary in this situation and it should be launched jointly by the Sindh and Punjab police.\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1630 GMT 25 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.3720331646147228,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Punjab\n*   Sindh\n*   Karachi\n*   Lahore\n*   Pakistan (implied by \"Pakistanis living abroad\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-57.62539291381836}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.531461Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daYW4IMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3669},"candidatesTokenCount":42,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":42}],"promptTokenCount":891,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":891}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1463,"totalTokenCount":2396,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:44.192223+00:00"}

Rossiya 1 showed them at the end of its programme as soon as the footage was ready to air. NTV missed them because its primetime bulletin comes out too early, but aired them at the start of its late-night news.\n\n\"The crime was committed at the hands of radical Islamists... But we can also see that using various channels, the United States is trying to convince its satellites and other countries that according to its intelligence, there are no Kyiv fingerprints to be found on the Moscow terrorist attack, and that the deadly terrorist attack was committed by followers of Islam, by members of ISIS... We know very well whose hands were used to commit this outrage against Russia and its people. What we want to establish is who gave the order,\" Putin was shown saying.\n\nHe repeated the earlier Russian claim that the suspects were supposedly heading for the Ukrainian border when they were apprehended hundreds of miles from Moscow, and hinted at Western complicity by suggesting that \"those who have been fighting against our country using the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime as their instruments\" may have been behind the latest attempt to \"intimidate\" Russia.\n\nThe same narrative was promoted by Rossiya 1 and Channel One in other reports about the terror attack.\n\nRossiya 1 showed a pundit claiming that the \"signature\" of the attack was uncharacteristic of ISIS terrorists, and that the attackers must have been recruited online by the Ukrainian secret services.\n\nIt is common knowledge that Ukraine has been actively recruiting agents in Russian territory, arming them and providing them with detailed plans for future attacks, the pundit said.\n\nOver on Channel One, a correspondent also made much of the unsubstantiated claim that the attackers were heading for Ukraine when they were apprehended, ignoring reports that the place where the suspects were caught is much closer to the Russian border with Belarus than with Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian-Ukrainian border \"is almost impossible to cross amid the ongoing special military operation\", but the attackers were promised a warm welcome on the Ukrainian side of the border, the correspondent claimed.\n\nHints at Western complicity\n\nPutin's latest remarks aside, the bulletins on Rossiya 1 and Channel One were rife with accusations against the West over its possible role in the attack and its conduct in the immediate aftermath.\n\nIn the headline sequence at the top of the bulletin, Rossiya 1 suggested that exonerating Ukraine was the paramount US concern at the moment.\n\n\"The West is afraid of finding out that Ukraine may have been complicit in the terror attack in Moscow.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: In “The Killing” (“Forbrydelsen”), which put Danish TV on the map and made Grabol a star back in 2007, the country’s justice system was held together by her morose detective, Sarah Lund. In her two most recent series, Grabol expands her public-service portfolio. In “The Shift” she plays Ella, the head midwife at Copenhagen’s best public pediatric hospital. And in “Prisoner” she’s Miriam, a reform-minded guard at a prison threatened with closing. Whether she is catching Denmark’s murderers, delivering its babies or minding its inmates, Grabol is indispensable.\n\nTo follow Grabol’s progress through the Danish infrastructure, the American viewer will need the streaming service MHz Choice (free trials currently available), which carries “The Shift” (2022) and premiered “Prisoner” (2023) this week. The three seasons of “The Killing” are on the streamer Topic, which will merge with MHz Choice on April 1, consolidating this segment of Grabol’s catalog. (She also plays a public official in the eerie British series “Fortitude,” available on multiple streamers.)\n\nThe shows centered on Sarah, Ella and Miriam are quite different — “The Killing” is a lurid crime thriller, “The Shift,” a big-hearted medical soap opera, “Prisoner,” a grim social-problem drama — but the characters have much in common.\n\nEach is aggrieved but indomitable, a working-class Sisyphus pushing ahead through institutional neglect and cowardice — a very squeaky wheel at work — while weighed down by personal trauma. Each is estranged from the only close family member still in her life; two become reluctant surrogate mothers to the women their troubled sons get pregnant. Perhaps Grabol has been typecast over the years, or has typecast herself. Or maybe the grouchy, standoffish, self-righteous pain in the butt is a character that resonates in Denmark.\n\nGrabol is an economical actor, able to communicate a world of emotion through her liquid eyes and seemingly offhand movements. (She’s also blessed with a notably dramatic pair of eyebrows.) She makes all of these bottled-up, difficult women believable and, even when they push everyone away, sympathetic — you can see the layers of pain and weariness that they shelter behind and occasionally break through.\n\nThe shows share a sensibility with Grabol’s performances; they are unflashy, meticulously made, superior examples of their genres. (“The Killing” was a trendsetter in transferring the outré violence of 1990s movie murderers into TV, but it presented their offenses with a Nordic reserve.)\n\n“The Shift” is a forthright hospital melodrama, and there’s even an amusing twist on “Grey’s Anatomy” in which Ella is followed around the hospital by her mother, an orderly who breaks into meetings to pester her daughter about her health and love life. The mostly female midwives serve the dramatic function that nurses often do in American stories, putting up with and bailing out the mostly male doctors. The show’s theme is the chronic understaffing of midwives in the public hospital, while its running motif is the staff’s obsession with food, from the critical attention paid to the pastries in the break room to the prescribing of toast and tea for all noncritical medical issues.\n\nBut in the hands of its creator and showrunner, the talented director Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), “The Shift” (the Danish title translates as “Day and Night”) has a winning sincerity and humor; it isn’t cloying, and it doesn’t traffic in bad outcomes to gin up emotion. Tricky story lines — a midwife who doubts herself when she’s gaslighted by a struggling doctor, another who sees her patients through the lens of her own history of abuse — are handled delicately. Ella fights for more midwives and finds herself pregnant at 46 (by a married doctor), but she’s chipper and funny, and Grabol gets to show a slightly softer side.\n\n“Prisoner,” created by Kim Fupz Aakeson with Frederik Louis Hviid and Michael Noer and written by Aakeson (who, in the small world of Danish TV, wrote two episodes of “The Shift”), takes the critique of the country’s social welfare in a much darker direction. It is structured as a tragedy: Three guards at a failing prison all have fatal vulnerabilities — a secret love life, a junkie son with debts, a friendship with an inmate — that drag them down into a tense and cleverly worked-out spiral of lies and vengeance.\n\nGrabol is primary in the ensemble of “The Shift,” but in “Prisoner” the attention is evenly split among her, Youssef Wayne Hvidtfeldt as the idealistic new guard Sammi and David Dencik as the compromised veteran Henrik. It’s largely Dencik’s show. Henrik, who vacillates between surly anger and puppy dog neediness, is the most interesting character, and Dencik (“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,” “Chernobyl”) is terrific.\n\nThe beat-downs, drug runs, racial animosities and inevitable spasm of group violence are all familiar, but in its six fairly tight episodes, “Prisoner” makes them credible and achieves a fair measure of the documentary-style grittiness it goes for. Grabol’s Miriam goes down some dark roads — she’s not the justice-obsessed grind of “The Killing” or the dedicated crusader of “The Shift” — but her heart is in the right place. Denmark is still lucky to have her.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9199375892753032,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1765,"startIndex":1533,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":2194,"startIndex":1912,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":2487,"startIndex":2259,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":3064,"startIndex":2536,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":3521,"startIndex":3128,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":3876,"startIndex":3569,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":4663,"startIndex":3956,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":5410,"startIndex":4777,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":6003,"startIndex":5563,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":6494,"startIndex":6080,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"},{"endIndex":7002,"startIndex":6538,"uri":"https://www.betafilm.com/news/860"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Denmark\n*   Copenhagen\n*   Copenhagen's best public pediatric hospital\n*   USA (implied by \"American viewer\" and \"American stories\")\n*   Britain (from \"British series\")\n*   Nordic region (from \"Nordic reserve\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-61.63581848144531}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.169025Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Z94dacGoCsK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4446},"candidatesTokenCount":67,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":67}],"promptTokenCount":1184,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1184}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1812,"totalTokenCount":3063,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.891737+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: When a recession did arrive, in 2020, it was because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut four years later, Australia has been unable to shake off some of the headwinds, including a high cost of living — the price of bread has risen 24 percent since 2021 — a choppy labor market and rising inequality. While these and similar issues are also troubling nations like Britain and the United States, they are particularly stinging to many in Australia, which has long seen itself as the “lucky country.”\n\nAustralia is among the wealthiest, most resource-rich and stable countries in the world. But millions of residents are experiencing levels of hardship not seen in many decades. They say they are struggling to put food on the table, pay for housing and health care and cover their utility bills. And many young Australians are confronting a reality that their ancestors never had to: that they will be worse off than their parents or grandparents.\n\nRobyn Northam, 28, once dreamed of becoming a hairdresser. But rising rent and exorbitant child care costs for her two children have put training out of reach. Just two generations ago, she said, her grandmother raised a family in her own home as a single parent, while working part-time as a nurse.\n\n“If you’re an average Australian, that’s virtually impossible,” said Ms. Northam, a content creator in Cairns who, with her partner, pays 600 Australian dollars, or about $400, a week in rent. “It’s a totally different world now.”\n\nAustralians are paying more for almost everything. The pandemic ushered in soaring inflation, which has since softened, though at 3.4 percent it remains relatively high. Rents in some Melbourne neighborhoods are up almost 50 percent year-over-year, and rental affordability is at its lowest in at least 17 years. Consumer sentiment has barely budged since tumbling in 2020.\n\nHomeowners are also under pressure. Australian mortgages are generally fixed for a few years at a time, and as the central bank has tried to rein in prices by raising interest rates, rates have tripled to 6.7 percent in recent years.\n\nThis strain has resulted in a spike in working families seeking support. Over 16 years, said Dave McNamara, the chief executive of Foodbank Victoria, “through bush fires and pandemics, I have not seen anything on the scale that we’re currently experiencing of people from all walks of life needing food relief.”\n\n“Things are a lot worse than they were prepandemic, and there’s little inspiration for us to be optimistic,” said Nikki Hutley, an independent economist in Sydney. “Everyone’s doing it really tough.”\n\nEconomists have long argued that too much Australian wealth is tied up in the housing market, even as shoddy policy, construction shortages and high immigration have brought an already low housing supply to a crunch point.\n\nPolling by the think tank Per Capita last year found that fewer than one in four Australians who did not own a home expected to be able to do so. “That’s not necessarily the be-all and end-all, if you’ve got a really stable rental system,” said Ms. Hutley, “but we have terrible laws in this country.”\n\nAustralian renters have fewer protections than in most other wealthy nations. Though laws vary between states, landlords have relatively few constraints on how much they can raise rent; renters face regular “inspections” of their homes; and the government offers large tax concessions for landlords.\n\nA shortage of rentals has also sent rents skyrocketing in some neighborhoods, pushing young people farther and farther out of cities. In Sydney, the exodus of young families, one recent report warned, risks creating a “city with no grandchildren.”\n\nTalitha Vermeulen, 25, has been looking to move within that city with her partner for the last four months. Often, available properties are leased before viewings can even occur, she said. “It’s just been frustrating to not even get a chance to see the place.”\n\nWith its wealth, stability and natural resources, Australia has more advantages than most other nations — life expectancy rates and wages are still among the world’s highest, with wage growth outstripping inflation last year. The stock market is trading near record levels.\n\nYet it is not evident that it is living up to its ample potential, said Julianne Schultz, an academic and the author of “The Idea of Australia.” “The thing that I keep coming back to is: It could be so much better,” she said, adding: “It’s a sort of lack of ambition.”\n\nThough Australians often proudly refer to “the lucky country,” the comment by the academic and writer Donald Horne was originally intended as one of reproach to the country’s leaders, whom he saw as incurious and unimaginative.\n\nAnd despite the country’s plentiful bounty and its oft-stated love of egalitarian values, Australia’s wealth is increasingly unevenly distributed, as the nation joins the ranks of others confronting rising inequality and economic and generational strains.\n\nEconomic unhappiness has translated to the lowest levels of “life satisfaction” since records began 22 years ago, according to the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index. The high cost of living, troubling global politics and rising inequality are all contributing factors, said Kate Lycett, the lead researcher. “It’s a huge number of people who are struggling to make ends meet,” she said.\n\nOn a recent Monday morning, people waited outside a food bank at a church in Richmond, a neighborhood of Melbourne. The food bank helps more than 100 households, and demand has increased sharply over the last six months, said Francis Flood, the coordinator.\n\n“We’ve seen a lot of people who work but can’t make it through to the end of the month,” he said. “We’re definitely helping people who, if you saw them on the street, you wouldn’t think would be using a food bank.”\n\nEven some who own their homes outright are struggling. Tracey Shepherd, 60, lives a short walk from the beach, in picture-perfect Surfers Paradise, Queensland. A former public servant, she has health issues that have made finding permanent work a struggle, and she is surviving on her retirement savings while she awaits a decision on a disability benefit.\n\nWith the high price of groceries and increases in maintenance fees on her apartment, life feels precarious, she said. “When I was younger, they’d say we’re the lucky country. It’s not like that now.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.9320869445800781,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":932,"startIndex":630,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":1625,"startIndex":1156,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":2112,"startIndex":1820,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":2763,"startIndex":2539,"uri":"https://financemoneymatters.com/6150-2/"},{"endIndex":3229,"startIndex":2993,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":3523,"startIndex":3278,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":4127,"startIndex":3903,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":4504,"startIndex":4177,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":4831,"startIndex":4531,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":5128,"startIndex":4880,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":5442,"startIndex":5179,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":5796,"startIndex":5522,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":6116,"startIndex":5850,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":6400,"startIndex":6173,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":6725,"startIndex":6451,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":7135,"startIndex":6761,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-boston-globe/20240328/281603835471918"},{"endIndex":7459,"startIndex":7198,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":7769,"startIndex":7553,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"},{"endIndex":8150,"startIndex":7791,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/27/happy-go-lucky-australia-is-feeling-neither-happy-nor-lucky/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Australia\n*   Britain\n*   United States\n*   Cairns\n*   Melbourne\n*   Victoria\n*   Sydney\n*   Richmond (a neighborhood of Melbourne)\n*   Surfers Paradise\n*   Queensland"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-54.99312973022461}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.859393Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4daYG6NOuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5360},"candidatesTokenCount":59,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":59}],"promptTokenCount":1380,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1380}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2171,"totalTokenCount":3610,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:53.054711+00:00"}

I am sure that now it is key to economic and social development. Thanks to this we have managed to exceed the majority of indicators of economic growth compared to an average level across Russian regions\".\n\nMaritime Territory is among the leaders in the Far East based on the attraction of investments and creation of new jobs, OTV Prim TV continued the next day.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Last week, the Russian authorities said that said six suspected IS fighters were killed in an anti-terrorist operation following a clash in the town of Karabulak in Ingushetia on 2 March. They said that the men had been behind an attack on a traffic police post and the killing of three police officers in March 2023.\n\nOn 10 March, the pro-IS Telegram channel \"Tafa'ul Mustamir\" (Constant Interaction) shared the 02:46-minute video. It was subsequently promoted by another prominent pro-IS media outlet, \"Bariqa News Agency\".\n\nThe video features one man who holds a rifle, with the trademark black IS banner behind him, as he \"renews\" his pledge of loyalty to IS leadership.\n\nHe delivers his message in very good Arabic, but with a slight accent, indicating he is not a native speaker of the language. The video does not indicate the date of recording.\n\nWhile the speaker does not identify himself nor speaks about any specific events in the clip shared online, the post by Tafa'ul Mustamir identifies him as \"Abd al-Karim al-Ingushi [from Ingushetia]\". It says he and his \"brothers\" (fellow militants) \"died fighting the criminal Russian authorities in Karabulak, Ingushetia\"\n\nThe speaker, however, does indicate that he is a member of IS's so-called Caucasus Province branch, which is one of the least active of IS's global affiliates. The last time that branch claimed an attack was on 28 December 2020, when it said one of its militants killed a police officer in Chechnya.\n\nThe message\n\nIn the short video, the speaker says \"we the mujahidin of the Caucasus wilayah [IS branch]\" urge IS's \"caliph\", Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, to be resolute on the path of jihad and \"be fair on all matters\". He tells him to \"march on\", assuring him \"there are men behind you [who have your back]\".\n\nFollowing from that, he \"renews\" his pledge of allegiance to Abu Hafs.\n\nThe speaker then turns to address \"our brother mujahidin everywhere, particularly those in Syria, Khorasan [Afghanistan-Pakistan region] and Africa\", expressing his \"love\" and \"solidarity\".\n\nHe also tells his fellow jihadists in these branches to avoid divisions and differences, adding that \"we must be like a single body against the infidels\".\n\nIt is unclear if this was general advice against disunity, or implies possible internal divisions across some branches. The same goes for the advice to Abu Hafs to be \"fair to all\" and firm on the path of jihad, and whether that too was general advice or implied some deeper meaning.\n\nThe speaker concludes his message by addressing male and female prisoners affiliated to IS, telling them \"we have not forgotten about you nor ever will\", adding that \"freeing you is our priority\".\n\nSuch messages to IS-linked prisoners is a staple of IS leadership addresses, which often tell the group's followers worldwide to make the freeing of prisoners their \"topmost priority\".\n\nIS itself has not shared the latest video nor indicated any involvement in the 2 March clashes in Ingushetia.\n\nSource: Telegram messaging service in Arabic 2128 gmt 10 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.350383819095672,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Karabulak\n*   Ingushetia\n*   Caucasus Province (also referred to as Caucasus wilayah)\n*   Chechnya\n*   Syria\n*   Khorasan (Afghanistan-Pakistan region)\n*   Africa"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-85.07418060302734}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:30.849365Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Xt4dadXrM8K2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2580},"candidatesTokenCount":63,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":63}],"promptTokenCount":728,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":728}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1536,"totalTokenCount":2327,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.301695+00:00"}

And on the issue of sending troops, they will be here,\" Rupsys said.\n\nThe Dragon 2024 exercise is aimed at testing allied ability to carry out deterrence and defence tasks by countering aggression by a potential enemy against NATO countries and conducting combat operations combining land, air and maritime components.\n\nThe exercise is one of the components of this year's NATO Steadfast Defender 2024 exercise.\n\nAccording to the Lithuanian army, the centerpiece operation of Dragon-24 is the deployment of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force to assist an ally in the event of aggression, which will also highlight the nuances and potential challenges of military mobility across national borders. When the exercise ends, the German enhanced Vigilance Brigade battalion will relocate for continued training in Lithuania as of March 7.\n\nA platoon from the Lithuanian army's Iron Wolf Infantry Brigade's reconnaissance company with JLTV all-terrain vehicles is currently participating in the exercise in Poland. In total, 20,000 troops and 3,500 pieces of military equipment from ten NATO countries are participating in the exercise.\n\nThe exercise is taking place in Lithuania amid a debate on whether Poland's own laws would allow it to defend Lithuania in the event of an attack on it.\n\nLithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said last week that Poland's legal restrictions \"do not impose an obligation\" to send troops abroad, even in the event of war, which would also apply in the event of an attack on neighbouring Lithuania.\n\nLater, the prime minister added she did not mean that \"the Poles will not defend us\", but rather that she was referring to specific legal constraints, which she was seeking to resolve with Poland at the \"political level\". The prime minister also said that she could not specify which restrictions she was referring to.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the day, Kestutis Budrys, an adviser to Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, said that a defence plan for the Suwaiki Corridor was drawn up back in 2022, and Polish troops would also defend the territory in Lithuania, so there is no legal restriction on it.\n\nNauseda said on Monday that join Lithuanian-Polish army exercises were meant to make sure that both countries act together.\n\nFor his part, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who visited Lithuania on Monday, said that Lithuanian-Polish solidarity was unquestionable. He also added that the Polish and Lithuanian foreign and defence ministers would soon \"decide on all the details so that there are no communication issues and uncertainties\", to avoid speculation on the issue.\n\nNATO's Article 5 stipulates that an armed attack on one or more of allied countries will be considered an attack on all of them. According to this article, all NATO members must agree to take action to help the attacked ally. However, any action requires the agreement of all NATO countries.\n\nSo far, this article has been activated once, in 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US.\n\nSource: Baltic News Service, Tallinn, in English 1349 gmt 5 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.153547460382635,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":976,"startIndex":670,"uri":"https://www.baltictimes.com/nato_plans_foresee_use_of_polish_troops_in_lithuania_s_defense___army_chief/"},{"endIndex":2221,"startIndex":1958,"uri":"https://www.baltictimes.com/nato_plans_foresee_use_of_polish_troops_in_lithuania_s_defense___army_chief/"},{"endIndex":2386,"startIndex":2107,"uri":"https://www.kariuomene.lt/en/newsevents/chief-of-defence-to-observe-nato-exercise-dragon-24-in-poland/25796"},{"endIndex":2770,"startIndex":2453,"uri":"https://www.baltictimes.com/nato_plans_foresee_use_of_polish_troops_in_lithuania_s_defense___army_chief/"},{"endIndex":3331,"startIndex":3096,"uri":"https://www.baltictimes.com/nato_plans_foresee_use_of_polish_troops_in_lithuania_s_defense___army_chief/"},{"endIndex":3754,"startIndex":3438,"uri":"https://www.baltictimes.com/nato_plans_foresee_use_of_polish_troops_in_lithuania_s_defense___army_chief/"},{"endIndex":5175,"startIndex":4888,"uri":"https://www.baltictimes.com/nato_plans_foresee_use_of_polish_troops_in_lithuania_s_defense___army_chief/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Poland\n*   Lithuania\n*   Suwaiki Corridor\n*   US\n*   Tallinn"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-38.06706619262695}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.006314Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daaoxwraY0A-gjZHQAg","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3164},"candidatesTokenCount":33,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":33}],"promptTokenCount":811,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":811}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1338,"totalTokenCount":2182,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.711831+00:00"}

En el acuerdo, Maduro dijo que celebraría elecciones antes de finales de año, y Estados Unidos, a su vez, levantó algunas sanciones como muestra de buena voluntad.\n\nPero pocos días después, Maduro vio cómo una candidata de la oposición, María Corina Machado, ganaba más del 90 por ciento de los votos en las elecciones primarias organizadas por la oposición, que no tuvieron la participación del gobierno. Los decisivos resultados acentuaron su popularidad y plantearon la posibilidad de que pudiera derrotarlo en unas elecciones generales.\n\nDesde entonces, el gobierno de Maduro inhabilitó a Machado para postularse, por lo que considera como irregularidades financieras ocurridas cuando era diputada nacional, y ha detenido a varios miembros de su campaña. En los eventos de Machado, se han presentado hombres en motocicleta que han atacado a sus simpatizantes.\n\nLa flexibilización temporal de las sanciones estadounidenses al sector del petróleo y el gas expira el 18 de abril, y el gobierno de Joe Biden podría optar por volver a imponerlas.\n\nEl anuncio del martes “deja meridianamente claro que Venezuela no celebrará elecciones libres y justas este año” y “prácticamente garantiza que el gobierno de Biden volverá a imponer sanciones”, declaró Geoff Ramsey, experto en Venezuela del Atlantic Council, institución de investigación con sede en Washington.\n\nEl chavismo, el movimiento de inspiración socialista que lidera Maduro, ha controlado Venezuela durante 25 años. En 2013, Maduro llegó al poder tras la muerte de su predecesor, el presidente Hugo Chávez, y se mantuvo en el poder tras unas elecciones celebradas en 2018 cuyos resultados se consideraron ampliamente fraudulentos. A esas elecciones siguió un periodo de aislamiento internacional, en el que muchos países siguieron el ejemplo de Estados Unidos y se negaron a hacer negocios con Venezuela.\n\nLa fecha de las próximas elecciones, el 28 de julio, es el cumpleaños de Chávez. El anuncio se produjo en la fecha de su muerte, el 5 de marzo.\n\nPhil Gunson, analista de International Crisis Group quien está radicado en Caracas, la capital del país, dijo que es probable que esa decisión busque aprovechar el legado de Chávez para reforzar la capacidad de elección de Maduro, quien es profundamente impopular.\n\nLos candidatos de la oposición tienen hasta el 25 de marzo para inscribirse. No está claro si el partido de Machado intentará insistir en su candidatura o si buscará apoyar a otro candidato.\n\nEs probable que una oposición fragmentada pueda ser una ventaja para la candidatura de Maduro.\n\n“La combinación de una oposición dividida, una fuerte abstención y unos oponentes débiles le da la mejor oportunidad de ganar sin tener que cometer fraude”, dijo Gunson.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.5818068640572684,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":761,"startIndex":536,"uri":"https://www.infobae.com/america/the-new-york-times/2024/03/06/venezuela-anuncia-que-las-elecciones-seran-en-julio-mientras-la-candidata-de-la-oposicion-sigue-inhabilitada/"},{"endIndex":1844,"startIndex":1630,"uri":"https://www.infobae.com/america/the-new-york-times/2024/03/06/venezuela-anuncia-que-las-elecciones-seran-en-julio-mientras-la-candidata-de-la-oposicion-sigue-inhabilitada/"},{"endIndex":3930,"startIndex":3679,"uri":"https://www.infobae.com/america/the-new-york-times/2024/03/06/venezuela-anuncia-que-las-elecciones-seran-en-julio-mientras-la-candidata-de-la-oposicion-sigue-inhabilitada/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Las ubicaciones mencionadas en el artículo son:\n\n*   Estados Unidos\n*   Venezuela\n*   Washington\n*   Caracas"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-44.290592193603516}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.883812Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daeT4NZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2876},"candidatesTokenCount":28,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":28}],"promptTokenCount":706,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":706}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1089,"totalTokenCount":1823,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.431938+00:00"}

President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic was serving a 19-year prison term there on the charges of extremism widely <a>seen as politically motivated</a>.\n\nNavalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's best-known opposition politician, had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption and a network of regional offices were designated as “extremist organizations” by the Russian government that same year.\n\nHis death, reported by penitentiary officials on Feb. 16, sent shockwaves around the globe, with opposition figures and Western leaders laying the blame on the Kremlin — something officials in Moscow vehemently rejected.\n\nThe politician's funeral in Moscow on March 1 drew thousands of supporters, a rare show of defiance in Putin's Russia amid unabating and ruthless crackdown on dissent. Those willing to pay tribute to Navalny, 47, kept streaming to his grave in southeastern Moscow for days after the ceremony. Navalny's widow Yulia has vowed to continue her late husband's work.\n\nVolkov used to be in charge of Navalny's regional offices and election campaigns — Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013 and sought to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election. Volkov left Russia several years ago under pressure from the authorities.\n\nLast year, Volkov and his team launched a project called “Navalny’s Campaigning Machine,” with the goal of talking to as many Russians as possible, either by phone or online, and turning them against Putin ahead of the March 15-17 presidential election.\n\nNot long before his death, Navalny has also urged supporters to flock to the polls at noon on Sunday, the final day of voting, to demonstrate their discontent with the Kremlin. His allies have been actively promoting the strategy, dubbed “Noon Against Putin,” in recent weeks.\n\nRussian independent news outlet Meduza said it interviewed Volkov several hours before the attack and asked him about risks for Navalny's team. “The key risk is that we will all be killed,” Meduza quoted Volkov as saying.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on X, formerly Twitter, that the news about an attack on Volkov are “shocking” and stressed that the \"perpetrators will have to answer for their crime.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4374310107941324,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":2030,"startIndex":1803,"uri":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexey-navalny-close-ally-attacked-in-lithuania-leonid-volkov/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Vilnius\n*   Arctic penal colony\n*   Russia\n*   Moscow\n*   Germany\n*   Kremlin\n*   southeastern Moscow\n*   Lithuania"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-67.55925750732422}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.704898Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4daYKDK6Wr1PIPgL3hyA4","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2144},"candidatesTokenCount":47,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":47}],"promptTokenCount":551,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":551}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1247,"totalTokenCount":1845,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.11319+00:00"}

If it passes there, and if Thailand’s king approves it, the country will become the first in Southeast Asia to recognize same-sex marriages. In Asia more broadly, only Taiwan and Nepal have done so.\n\nThailand’s bill describes marriage as a partnership between two individuals, rather than between a woman and a man. It will also give L.G.B.T.Q. couples equal rights to various tax savings, the ability to inherit property and the power to give medical treatment consent for partners who are incapacitated. The draft will also grant adoption rights. Thai law currently allows only heterosexual couples to adopt, although single women can adopt children with special needs.\n\n“The amendment of this law is for all Thai people. It is the starting point to create equality,” Danuphorn Punnakanta, a lawmaker who chairs the lower house’s committee on marriage equality, told Parliament. “We understand that this law is not a universal cure to every problem, but at least it’s the first step toward equality in Thai society.”\n\nThe legislation has been more than a decade in the making, with obstacles stemming from political upheaval and disagreements as to the approach to take and what to include in the bill. In December, Parliament passed four proposed draft bills on same-sex marriage; one was put forward by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s administration, and three additional versions by the Move Forward Party, the Democrat Party and the civil sector were considered. These four were combined into a single draft that was passed on Wednesday.\n\n“This is the greatest victory,” said Nada Chaiyajit, a law lecturer at Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, who has supported the law from its beginnings. “We have been working hard with the committee. This is not only about L.G.B.T.I.Q., this is about everyone. Equality.”\n\nThailand is one of the most open places in the world for L.G.B.T.Q. people, though some elements of its Buddhist-dominated culture are socially conservative.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.3305926513671875,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":848,"startIndex":554,"uri":"https://www.asian-voice.com/News/International/%27Dirty-Harry%27-pleads-not-guilty-of-smuggling-people"},{"endIndex":1252,"startIndex":935,"uri":"https://splainer.in/sections/2024/Show-No-Evil/headlines-that-matter"},{"endIndex":1411,"startIndex":1167,"uri":"https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274208096/with-landmark-bill-thailand-moves-closer-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage"},{"endIndex":1846,"startIndex":1529,"uri":"https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274208096/with-landmark-bill-thailand-moves-closer-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage"},{"endIndex":2456,"startIndex":2135,"uri":"https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274208096/with-landmark-bill-thailand-moves-closer-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage"},{"endIndex":2733,"startIndex":2505,"uri":"https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274208096/with-landmark-bill-thailand-moves-closer-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Thailand\n*   Southeast Asia\n*   Asia\n*   Taiwan\n*   Nepal\n*   Mae Fah Luang University (located in Chiang Rai)\n*   Chiang Rai"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-66.52963256835938}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.046634Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daarsAqHp1PIPx6PS2AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":1790},"candidatesTokenCount":50,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":50}],"promptTokenCount":467,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":467}],"thoughtsTokenCount":959,"totalTokenCount":1476,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:42.287725+00:00"}

In the end the military was able to rescue more than 130,000 civilians before the final U.S. military aircraft departed.\n\nThat chaos was the end result of the State Department failing to call for an evacuation of U.S. personnel until it was too late, Milley and McKenzie told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\n“On 14 August the non-combatant evacuation operation decision was made by the Department of State and the U.S. military alerted, marshalled, mobilized and rapidly deployed faster than any military in the world could ever do,” Milley said.\n\nBut the State Department's decision came too late, Milley said.\n\n“The fundamental mistake, the fundamental flaw was the timing of the State Department,” Milley said. “That was too slow and too late.\"\n\nIn a lengthy statement late Tuesday, the National Security Council took issue with the generals' remarks, saying that Biden's hard decision was the right thing to do and part of his commitment to get the U.S. out of America's longest war.\n\nThe president “was not going to send another generation of troops to fight and die in a conflict that had no end in sight,” the NSC said. “We have also demonstrated that we do not need a permanent troop presence on the ground in harm’s way to remain vigilant against terrorism threats.”\n\nThe statement said the president and first lady still mourn for those lost at Abbey Gate and are “enormously proud of the men and women of our military, our diplomats and the intel community who conducted that withdrawal,” the NSC said.\n\nIn the hearing, which was prompted by a lengthy investigation by the House Foreign Affairs Committee into the decisions surrounding the evacuation of Kabul, McKenzie spoke at length about his discomfort in how little seemed to be ready for an evacuation, even raising those concerns with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\nEvacuation orders must come from the State Department, but in the weeks and months before Kabul fell to the Taliban, the Pentagon was still pressing the State Department for evacuation plans, McKenzie said.\n\n“We had forces in the region as early as 9 July, but we could do nothing\" without State ordering the evacuation, McKenzie said, calling State’s timing “the fatal flaw that created what happened in August.”\n\n“I believe the events of mid and late August 2021 were the direct result of delaying the initiation of the (evacuation) for several months, in fact until we were in extremis and the Taliban had overrun the country,\" McKenzie said.\n\nMilley was the nation's top-ranking military officer at the time, and had urged President Joe Biden to keep a residual force of 2,500 forces there to give Afghanistan's special forces enough back-up to keep the Taliban at bay and allow the U.S. military to hold on to Bagram Air Base, which could have provided the military additional options to respond to Taliban attacks.\n\nBiden did not approve the larger residual force, opting to keep a smaller force of 650 that would be limited to securing the U.S. embassy. That smaller force was not adequate to keeping Bagram, which was quickly taken over by the Taliban.\n\nThe Taliban have controlled Afghanistan since the U.S. departure, resulting in many dramatic changes for the population, including the near-total loss of rights for women and girls.\n\nThe White House found last year that the chaotic withdrawal occurred because President Joe Biden was “constrained” by previous agreements made by President Donald Trump to withdraw forces.\n\nThat 2023 internal review further appeared to shift any blame in the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, saying it was the U.S. military that made one possibly key decision.\n\n“To manage the potential threat of a terrorist attack, the President repeatedly asked whether the military required additional support to carry out their mission at HKIA,” the 2023 report said, adding, “Senior military officials confirmed that they had sufficient resources and authorities to mitigate threats.”\n\n___\n\nAP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7111177444458008,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":823,"startIndex":468,"uri":"https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/us-ex-generals-blame-biden-for-chaotic-afghanistan-exit-17435142"},{"endIndex":2716,"startIndex":2511,"uri":"https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/us-ex-generals-blame-biden-for-chaotic-afghanistan-exit-17435142"},{"endIndex":3142,"startIndex":2888,"uri":"https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/us-ex-generals-blame-biden-for-chaotic-afghanistan-exit-17435142"},{"endIndex":3429,"startIndex":3218,"uri":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3256010/failures-biden-administration-drove-fall-kabul-say-top-former-us-generals"},{"endIndex":3820,"startIndex":3507,"uri":"https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/us-ex-generals-blame-biden-for-chaotic-afghanistan-exit-17435142"},{"endIndex":4731,"startIndex":4525,"uri":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3256010/failures-biden-administration-drove-fall-kabul-say-top-former-us-generals"},{"endIndex":5070,"startIndex":4831,"uri":"https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/failures-of-biden-govt-in-planning-drove-fall-of-kabul-top-ex-us-generals-124032000020_1.html"},{"endIndex":5562,"startIndex":5333,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":6824,"startIndex":6580,"uri":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3256010/failures-biden-administration-drove-fall-kabul-say-top-former-us-generals"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   White House\n*   Kabul airport (also referred to as Hamid Karzai International Airport and HKIA)\n*   Abbey Gate\n*   Afghanistan\n*   House Foreign Affairs Committee\n*   U.S. (United States/America)\n*   Kabul\n*   Pentagon\n*   Bagram Air Base (also referred to as Bagram)\n*   U.S. embassy"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-68.26730346679688}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.580849Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4dafG5I5e6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3988},"candidatesTokenCount":96,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":96}],"promptTokenCount":997,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":997}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1806,"totalTokenCount":2899,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.72667+00:00"}

Work is being carried out to encircle, squeeze out and annihilate them. Competent forces have been deployed, although, in my opinion, the very fact of this situation is quite unpleasant,\" Trehubov said.\n\nThe 1st Azov Corps of the National Guard of Ukraine, which has been reportedly deployed to the Dobropillya area, said on Telegram late on 13 August that \"the enemy is suffering significant losses\" as a result of \"actions\" carried out by it and other units.\n\n\"As a result of the fighting, 151 occupiers have been liquidated in the corps' area of responsibility.

He also voiced hope that eventually \"we will see a better situation on the battlefield\".\n\nThe TV noted that some 25 Ukrainian population centres are currently in the \"active combat zone\".\n\n\"Some villages have been completely destroyed,\" it added.\n\nWar update\n\nThere were 148 combat engagements between Ukrainian and Russian troops on 13 August, the Ukrainian General Staff reported on Facebook the following morning.\n\nThe Pokrovsk sector was the hottest spot on the front line in Ukraine, with 56 Russian attacks reported there.\n\nFourteen clashes were reported in the Novopavlivka sector, 14 in the Siversk sector, 13 in the Lyman sector, seven in the Toretsk sector, six in the Northern Slobozhanshchyna sector (covers parts of Sumy Region) and the Kursk sector, five in the Southern Slobozhanshchyna sector (covers parts of Kharkiv Region), four in Kherson Region, three in the Kramatorsk sector, three in the Kupyansk sector, one in the Orikhiv sector and one in the Hulyaypole sector.\n\nRussia carried out two missile and 87 air strikes using four missiles and 154 glide bombs, and shelled Ukraine 5,758 times, including 82 times with MRLS.

Kakar said it is a scheme to bring small traders in the retail sector under the tax net. He noted even though traders and shopkeepers contribute to the economy of the country, they have no contribution in the taxes. He mentioned first the retailers would be registered and then tax collection would be started from 1 July.\n\nKakar said other sectors like agriculture and service sector are also not included in revenue collection and the government is now trying to bring them under the tax net. He noted the government has made the system easier for traders. He emphasised \"tax culture\" should be promoted in the country and said automation and digitisation of the tax collection system are needed.\n\nZulfiqar asked journalist Mehtab Haider about the objective of the tax scheme for retailers. Haider said similar schemes were introduced in the past as well and this time a new effort has been made to launch a \"simple and easy\" scheme. He mentioned the registration process would begin from 1 April and tax collection would be started from 1 July. He noted the number of retailers in Pakistan is around 3.5 million and the scheme is being launched in six major cities in its first phase. Talking about Pakistan's plan to float the Panda Bond, he said the government has decided to tap into the Chinese market by launching these bonds.\n\nZulfiqar asked Nawabzada Riaz Nosherwani, chief executive officer of the Royal Minerals Company, to comment on the new tax measures. Nosherwani said taxation is a \"two-way traffic\" and noted the mining business in Balochistan is the highest contributor to the revenue. He mentioned raw materials like iron ore, manganese, and chromite are exported and the government collects additional taxes on this export. He appreciated the government for finally announcing some steps to support the mining sector.\n\nNosherwani said the government's focus is more on foreign investment and argued that consortiums of local investors should be encouraged because foreign investors take money out of the country. He noted lengthy bureaucratic procedures and lack of continuity in policy are the major hurdles for foreign investors in Pakistan. He was of the view that Pakistan should try to look at other countries besides China for investments in the country.\n\nZulfiqar asked Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) politician Sakina Abdullah Khan how her party views the situation of terrorism in the country and how far the National Action Plan against terrorism approved in 2014 has been implemented. Khan said the 20 points of the National Action Plan include clauses regarding \"criminal justice\". She noted security agencies take action and catch militants, but the justice system is not able to punish those elements, so they are released. She insisted these \"flaws in the mechanism\" require changes through legislation.\n\nKhan noted \"terror groups\" have been banned but they re-emerge with new names. She further noted Islamic seminaries have been registered and regulated but there is a need to bring changes in the curriculum of mainstream schools as well. She said websites of the banned groups have been blocked but freedom of expression of other people should not be curtailed in this process. She appreciated the new Chief Minister of Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti (PPP member) for having an \"excellent experience\" as the home minister of the province and managing it well.\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 24 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.087559980504653,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Quetta\n*   Pakistan\n*   China\n*   Balochistan\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-36.9770393371582}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.576830Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4dab6aI8CSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3034},"candidatesTokenCount":34,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":34}],"promptTokenCount":731,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":731}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1066,"totalTokenCount":1831,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:47.15311+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: On Friday, an American jury in Federal District Court found Mr. Hernández guilty of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and of possessing and conspiring to possess “destructive devices,” including machine guns.\n\nAfter the verdict was delivered, Mr. Hernández, who faces a mandatory prison term of at least 40 years and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 26, rose to his feet and stood quietly with folded hands as the jurors filed from the courtroom.\n\nDuring his first presidential campaign in 2013, Mr. Hernández, a member of the right-wing Honduran National Party, portrayed himself as a law-and-order candidate who could stem the epidemic of drugs and crime that had suffused the country.\n\nBut according to prosecutors in the United States, Mr. Hernández was allied with the same forces he purported to oppose. A string of witnesses testified during a conspiracy trial in Manhattan that Mr. Hernández’s political success was fueled by drug proceeds funneled to him by cocaine traffickers whom he treated as business partners.\n\nProsecutors have said that Mr. Hernández received millions of dollars from trafficking organizations in Honduras, Mexico and elsewhere, including from Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, who was a Mexican drug lord and the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. In return, prosecutors added, Mr. Hernández allowed vast amounts of cocaine to pass through Honduras on its way to the United States.\n\nHe boasted that he would “stuff the drugs right up the noses of the gringos,” according to U.S. prosecutors.\n\nEvidence and testimony presented during Mr. Hernández’s trial painted a dismal picture of a country where drugs and politics had long been intertwined and people working in politics routinely demanded and accepted bribes.\n\nRows of benches in the trial courtroom were filled each day with Hondurans who said they had come to watch Mr. Hernández face a judicial process of the sort some doubted could have taken place in his home country.\n\nSome of those spectators laughed derisively when Mr. Hernández, wearing a businesslike dark suit, testified near the end of the trial, insisting that he had no connection to drug trafficking and that the witnesses who had testified to the contrary were “professional liars.”\n\nA defense lawyer expanded upon that idea during his summation, running through a list of crimes — including a total of 224 murders — associated with several former traffickers who took the stand as government witnesses.\n\n“This was a cast of characters you have never seen before and the likes of which you will never see again as long as you live,” the lawyer, Renato Stabile, said. “Through the trial these people have told you they were liars. They have told you they were murderers.”\n\nBut a prosecutor, Jacob H. Gutwillig, told jurors that Mr. Hernández had accepted “cocaine-fueled bribes” from cartels and “protected their drugs with the full power and strength of the state — military, police and justice system.”\n\nAlthough former foreign leaders sometimes go to trial in the United States, they are not often prosecuted for drug-related offenses. The closest parallel to Mr. Hernández is Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the former leader of Panama, who in 1992 was found guilty in federal court in Miami of allowing the Medellín drug cartel to ship cocaine through his country to the United States in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes.\n\nBy the time Mr. Hernández stepped down from the presidency in 2022, he was a deeply unpopular figure in Honduras. His administration had done little to blunt the effects of crime or to create a stable economy, leading many citizens to leave the country. Mr. Hernández’s successor as president, Xiomara Castro, accused him of having turned the nation into a “narco-dictatorship,” and thousands of Hondurans celebrated when he was extradited to New York three months after leaving office.\n\nThere were celebrations outside the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, too, after the guilty verdict was announced. Dozens of people waved Honduran flags and chanted in Spanish. One woman held aloft a sign that read: “No clemency for narcopolitics.”\n\nPhotographs of people who were said to be victims of cartel violence were displayed along with an orange prison jumpsuit with handcuffs connected by a long chain.\n\nStanding in the middle of the crowd, Carlos Hernandez, 32, said he had left Honduras while he was still a teenager to escape the violence and poverty there.\n\n“This is historical,” he said of the verdict. “This brings the Honduran people a sense of justice they have been fighting for for a long time.”\n\nMr. Hernández’s trial was relatively straightforward, based mainly on testimony from witnesses, including a Honduran drug investigator and the former traffickers, including two men who said they had pleaded guilty to grave crimes and are facing potential life sentences in American prisons.\n\nThe investigator, Miguel Reynoso, testified that he was present when the Honduran authorities stopped a group of vehicles with hidden compartments and found firearms, grenades and nearly $200,000 in U.S. currency wrapped in plastic. The authorities also found notebooks with Mr. Hernández’s initials that prosecutors in Manhattan said detailed drug transactions.\n\nMr. Reynoso testified that the notebooks were placed into sealed plastic bags and that he brought those, seals intact, to prosecutors in the United States in 2019.\n\nAmong the former traffickers who took the stand was Amilcar Alexander Ardon Soriano, who testified that he had served as the mayor of the municipality of El Paraíso while running drugs, participated in torture and murdered two people, and that he was responsible for the deaths of more than 50 others. He said that he had asked lawmakers whom he had previously bribed to vote for Mr. Hernández as the president of the Honduran Congress. In return, Mr. Ardon said, Mr. Hernández promised to protect him from prosecutors.\n\nMr. Ardon added that he gave $500,000 in drug proceeds to Mr. Hernández’s presidential campaign in 2013 and had bribed people in El Paraíso to vote for him. He also said it was his understanding that El Chapo had agreed to provide that campaign with $1 million.\n\nDevis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, a former leader of the brutal Honduran gang Los Cachiros, was probably the most notorious witness to take the stand. He began secretly working with American authorities a decade ago and admitted to being involved in the deaths of 78 people, including two journalists and an official who was serving as Honduras’s antidrug czar.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Rivera testified, he had bribed Mr. Hernández with $250,000 delivered to his sister, Hilda, in exchange for protection of the Cachiros.\n\nAsked by a defense lawyer whether he felt any remorse over the people he had harmed, Mr. Rivera replied that he was sorry for everything he did as a member of what he called “a dangerous gang,” including his payment of bribes to “corrupt” police officers and politicians.\n\n“They should have tried to catch us,” he said, adding that instead “they allied with us.”\n\nNate Schweber contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.87690297111136,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   United States\n*   Federal District Court\n*   courtroom\n*   Honduras\n*   Manhattan\n*   Mexico\n*   Panama\n*   Miami\n*   New York\n*   Lower Manhattan\n*   El Paraíso"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-114.49108123779297}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.539577Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94dabn3IMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5996},"candidatesTokenCount":61,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":61}],"promptTokenCount":1507,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1507}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1004,"totalTokenCount":2572,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.893306+00:00"}

There must be mutual respect instead.\"\n\nHe blamed the current economic crisis in Pakistan on its \"despotic army\", saying that it has political and security issues with all its neighbours, including Afghanistan, India, Iran and China.\n\nThe former Taliban diplomat further said that by attacking Afghanistan, the \"despotic\" Pakistani army \"wants to divert Pakistani people's attention from its failures, incompetence and political instability in Pakistan\".\n\nWhen asked about the international community's \"silence\" on the Afghan-Pakistan tensions, Zaeef accused other countries of trying to \"use\" the deterioration of relations between the neighbouring countries as a tool to put pressure on the ruling Taliban, but advised the group to contemplate about its priorities, including engagement with the world, education and \"nation building\".\n\nAsked whether Pakistan would change its policy towards Afghanistan, he said that Islamabad's approach towards Kabul will \"never change as long as Pakistan's military is its policy-maker.\"\n\nA commentator from Germany, Torialay Zazai, also urged the Taliban to strengthen internal unity and \"encourage national mobilisation against Pakistan.\"\n\nHe called on the Taliban leadership to \"retaliate to one bullet with 10\", adding that \"now the situation is not for dialogue\". Zazai accused Pakistan of \"trying to show to the world that there is no stability in the region\", saying that Islamabad \"wants to extract money from the international community\" on the Afghan issue.\n\n\"If the world wants to eliminate terrorists in the world, they should partition and isolate Pakistan.

Pakistan has often shelled Kunar, Paktia, Paktika.\"\n\n\"Pakistan is weak at the moment, although we wish it was not so. Its economy is stagnating, and political stability is worsening.

Whether it slows down the election interference case against Mr. Trump and his 14 co-defendants remains unclear.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals must still decide if it will weigh in on whether Ms. Willis has an untenable conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship she had with a lawyer she hired to run the Trump case, and on other related matters.\n\nJudge McAfee wrote in his brief order that he “intends to continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions” while the higher court decides what to do.\n\nIf the appeals court declines to take up the question, the matter will be resolved quickly. If it decides an appeal is warranted, the matter could take months to clear up.\n\nIn a statement, Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for Ms. Willis’s office, said that prosecutors would continue to work on the case.\n\n“As the case is not stayed during the appeal, this office will work to move it forward to trial as quickly as possible,” Mr. DiSantis said. “We will limit our comment on the appellate matter to what we file with the Court of Appeals during the briefing process.”\n\nSteven H. Sadow, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer in Georgia, called the order “highly significant” in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the defense was “optimistic that appellate review will lead to the case being dismissed and the D.A. being disqualified.”\n\nNo trial date has been set in the broader case; the district attorney’s office had sought to begin a trial in early August, about a year after Ms. Willis brought charges, but few expect that to happen now.\n\nThe case charges Mr. Trump and a number of his allies with conspiring to circumvent the will of Georgia voters in 2020. But the details of the case have been overshadowed this year by hearings delving into a romantic relationship that Ms. Willis had with Nathan J. Wade, the lawyer she hired to run the Trump case.\n\nLast week, Judge McAfee ruled that Ms. Willis and her office could continue leading the prosecution so long as Mr. Wade stepped away from it. Defense lawyers, who brought the relationship to light in court filings, had sought to disqualify Ms. Willis, saying she had an untenable conflict of interest.\n\nJudge McAfee disagreed, but rebuked Ms. Willis in his ruling for a “tremendous lapse in judgment.” He also found an “appearance of impropriety,” which he said required Mr. Wade to withdraw in order for Ms. Willis to keep the case.\n\nMr. Wade resigned from his post as a special prosecutor hours after the ruling on Friday.\n\nUnder Georgia law, the defense lawyers now have 10 days to file an application to the appeals court arguing why an appeal is necessary. The district attorney’s office will have 10 days from the filing of that application to respond.\n\nThe appeals court will have 45 days from the defense filing to say whether it is going to take the case or not.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.828174454825265,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Fulton County Superior Court\n*   Georgia Court of Appeals\n*   Georgia"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-51.18888473510742}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.798172Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dadzbMMCSmNAPlpuqmQQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2522},"candidatesTokenCount":28,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":28}],"promptTokenCount":658,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":658}],"thoughtsTokenCount":481,"totalTokenCount":1167,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.561212+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Raza asked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) politician Qaiser Ahmed Shaikh whether he would be assigned a ministry related to business and economy. Shaikh agreed and remarked one can perform only if he is assigned a task in which he has a background and experience. He noted \"business confidence\" in Pakistan is at the lowest ebb and the main task before the government at the moment is to fix the economy. He mentioned the prime minister spoke in detail about the economic issues and expressed the resolve that his government's full-fledged attention would be on the economy.\n\nRaza asked Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) politician Nadir Gabol whether his party would join the cabinet at a later stage. Gabol replied Bilawal Bhutto Zardari (PPP chairperson) has repeatedly stated that his party would not join the cabinet but would support Shehbaz Sharif's government on an \"issue to issue basis\". He said the objective of it is to give Sharif a chance to focus on governance and select a cabinet of his choice. He added the PPP wants that relief should be provided to the people and the issue of terrorism should also be addressed.\n\nGabol said the PPP might review its decision about joining the cabinet after a few years if the situation improves. He explained his party does not want to join the cabinet because its ideology is very different from that of the PML-N as the former is a \"progressive centre-left party\".\n\nRaza asked analyst Sana Mirza whether political stability is expected since Asif Ali Zardari from the PPP has been elected as the president and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has also joined the parliament. Mirza replied, \"If we think that the PTI will sit quietly because it is now in the parliament, it is wrong\". She noted after elections, the PTI claimed that its right has been taken away as other parties have formed a government.\n\nMirza claimed the PTI will not let the parliament work if its demands are not addressed. She noted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has demanded that a commission should be formed to look into the election results and the 9 May incidents (violent protests by alleged PTI members after the arrest of the then-chairperson Imran Khan) but it would be a lengthy process. She further noted PTI politician Asad Qaiser claimed if a \"certain personality [referring to former chief minister of Punjab Mohsin Naqvi]\" is appointed as the interior minister, \"doors of talks would be closed permanently\". She said the PTI has alleged that Naqvi played an important role in the rigging of elections in Punjab.\n\nMirza said the people included in the cabinet are those who can work with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. She claimed the [military] establishment also had some influence in the selection of the cabinet. She was of the view that a \"technocrat government\" is needed at the moment to solve the economic problems of the country.\n\nShaikh noted the allegations of election rigging have been levelled by the PTI in every election. He appreciated the PPP's decision to support the PML-N government and said by not joining the cabinet, PPP has allowed the PML-N to form its government and adopt its manifesto. He termed it a \"favour by the PPP\" and expressed hope in the two parties working in coordination with each other.\n\nShaikh said Prime Minister Sharif is \"dedicated\" and \"determined\" to solve the economic problems, increasing exports, and promoting industries. He remarked the government's direction will become clear in the next few months. He was of the view that the PTI would not continue its protests for a very long time because that would make it unpopular among its voters. He opined the government would decrease the interest rate gradually because an interest rate over 10 to 12 per cent would be unfavourable for business development.\n\nGabol said President Zardari would not have executive powers but he would play a different role. He recalled during his previous tenure, Zardari had contributed significantly to economic matters.\n\nShaikh disagreed with the view that the government would not be stable and insisted Pakistan is at a \"make or break stage\". He said the country cannot continue taking more loans, so all stakeholders will have to sit together. He was of the view that \"drastic changes\" would be brought by the new government regarding allocation of funds to different areas. He also mentioned election reforms would be discussed in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament).\n\nMirza said the team chosen by Prime Minister Sharif includes people who have proven themselves as good administrators. She was of the view that Sharif is the \"ultimate choice for prime ministership\" at the time when Pakistan is facing many issues and he should try to perform with a \"limited team\".\n\nSource: PTV News, Islamabad, in Urdu 1500 GMT 11 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.2072701887650923,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"*   Pakistan\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n*   Punjab\n*   Islamabad"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-48.55994415283203}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:36.575004Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ZN4daZyMI_DRmNAP9rDgkQM","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4071},"candidatesTokenCount":22,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":22}],"promptTokenCount":1014,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1014}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1448,"totalTokenCount":2484,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:46.057277+00:00"}

during the 263rd Corps Commanders' Conference (CCC) chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi city of Punjab province. &#160;\n\nISPR said the \"forum noted that the Armed Forces of Pakistan at a great peril to their primary responsibility, provided security environment for the conduct of GE-24 [general elections 2024] as per the given mandate, and had nothing to do with the electoral process\". &#160;\n\nHowever, the forum expressed \"dismay that some vested small segments of polity and media especially social media have been maligning Armed Forces of Pakistan with unsubstantiated allegations of interference which is highly deplorable,\" ISPR said.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that rather than focusing on real issues such as good governance, economic recovery, political stability and public wellbeing, entire focus of such vested elements is on creating political instability and uncertainty by attempting to scapegoat others for their own failings,\" ISPR added.\n\nThe ISPR further said that the forum emphasised that \"due legal processes be followed with evidence and proof rather than resorting to unconstitutional and uncalled for baseless political rhetoric and emotional outbursts\".\n\n\"Forum noted with satisfaction the smooth democratic transition of power in the Centre [federal government] and provinces,\" ISPR said adding forum hoped that the post elections environment brings in \"desired political and economic stability resulting into peace and prosperity for the people of Pakistan\". &#160;&#160;\n\nThe ISRP said that forum paid rich tribute to the supreme sacrifices of Shuhadas [martyrs] including officers and men of the armed forces, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and the citizens who have laid their lives for ensuring peace and stability in the country. &#160;\n\n\"Forum resolved that terrorists, their facilitators and abettors, working on behest of hostile forces to destabilise Pakistan, will be dealt with full might of the state,\" ISPR said. &#160;\n\nThe ISPR further said that COAS directed commanders to \"continue consolidating the gains of efforts against terrorism and militancy\". &#160;\n\nISPR said that in line with the resolve of the honourable prime minister of Pakistan, the forum committed that \"planners, instigators, abettors and perpetrators/desecrators of Shuhada Monuments and attackers of military installations on 9 May, would certainly be brought to justice under the relevant provisions of the law and Constitution\".&#160;\n\nThe workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) have been accused of ransacking public property and military installations following arrest of party founder, Imran Khan that day. &#160;&#160;\n\n\"The forum expressed concerns over continued repression of Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (India-administered Kashmir) and condemned the unabated human rights violations by India,\" ISPR said adding the forum reaffirmed that Pakistan shall continue to support Kashmiris \"politically, diplomatically and morally at all levels\".\n\nThe forum also expressed complete solidarity with the Palestinians and condemned \"serious human rights violations and war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza\", ISPR said. &#160;&#160;\n\nThe development received

lodged in a jail in several cases since 5 August, 2023. &#160;\n\nPTI leaders including Omar Ayub Khan and Asad Qaiser submitted the resolution, pro-military Urdu TV news channel Samaa TV reported. &#160;\n\nThe resolution demanded immediate release of Khan, emphasising that \"he is a prominent leader of the Muslim world,\" the news report added.\n\nThe resolution said that cases against the PTI founder were registered to \"politically victimise\" him and keep him away from the masses, Urdu TV news channel ARY News reported. &#160;\n\nMeanwhile, Qaiser said that the PTI would unite all

in April 2022. &#160;\n\nThe development received extensive coverage in the frontline newspapers and online media outlets.\n\n\"The people of the province trusted the PTI and voted for Gandapur to

Russia has more jamming equipment capable of overpowering Ukrainian signals by broadcasting on the same frequencies at higher power. It also exhibits better coordination among their units.\n\nWith western military aid looking far from certain and artillery ammunition running low, the pressure on Ukraine’s unmanned air capacity has only grown, leaving Kyiv’s forces in an increasingly perilous position.\n\nInterviews with Ukrainian soldiers, commanders and military analysts say that Russia’s jamming capabilities are straining Ukraine’s limited supplies of off-the-shelf drones and threatening to sideline a key component of Ukraine’s arsenal as the Kremlin mass produces its own fleet of drones.\n\nUkrainian troops describe a back and forth dance where one side makes technological changes — such as using different frequencies or jamming devices for drones — then the other side catches up in a matter of weeks or months, undercutting any short-lived advantage.\n\n“There is a constant arms race,” said Babay, a sergeant in charge of a drone platoon on Ukraine’s eastern front, who, like DJ and others interviewed for this article, went by his call sign, as is military protocol. “We are improving our technology to counter these new realities on the battlefield, and in a while, the Russians will again have to invent something new to be able to defend themselves against our attacks.”\n\nSmall, cheap drones have been a staple of the conflict in Ukraine since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists attacked in the country’s east. But in 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the use of the unmanned vehicles over the battlefield ballooned.\n\nIn 2023, Ukraine gained the upper hand in the drone war by deploying the compact racing drones known as FPVs, for First Person Views, in large quantities.\n\n“FPVs play a critical role for us, as these toys are essentially mobile artillery that compensate for the lack of artillery ammunition,” said Dyadya, a drone operator with the 63rd Mechanized Brigade. “We work at the same distance as a mortar, but our accuracy is much higher.”\n\nArtillery’s strength often comes from its imprecision. By blanketing wide areas with high explosives and fragmentation, it can quickly disrupt battlefield operations by maiming troops and destroying vehicles. It’s a tactic that is near impossible to replicate with one or two drones.\n\nAs Ukraine’s artillery ammunition dwindled last fall and into the winter, the FPVs, used as guided projectiles, were effective in suppressing and harassing Russian trenches and vehicles. Precious artillery ammo was reserved to push back Russian ground attacks.\n\nBut the Russian military has since improved its jamming capabilities and also uses poor weather to its advantage, advancing in fog and rain when drones have difficulty flying.\n\n“Both sides have quickly picked up on their adversary’s key FPV developments and tactics,” said Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russian military drones at the Center for Naval Analyses, a research organization based in Virginia. “And now these technologies are maturing very rapidly for both sides.”\n\nEarlier this month, DJ’s small team, part of a national guard unit known as the Bureviy Brigade, set up their drone outpost among the ruins of a farmhouse near the frontline outside of Kreminna. They deployed the essentials needed to broadcast video and relay commands from the pilot to the cheap Chinese made FPV quadcopter: antennas, frequency relays, Starlink satellite internet and a laptop computer.\n\nOn the first two missions, DJ’s monitor showed the Ukrainian steppe below as his drone catapulted through the wilderness at upward of 60 miles per hour, strapped with roughly three pounds of high explosives and aimed at destroying Russian vehicles. But soon, the signal was lost, jammed by the Russians.\n\nThe third mission, targeting a grenade launcher in a Russian trench line, was partially successful: The $500 dollar drone detonated in a tree above the trench, but it had been jammed just a dozen or so yards away before it exploded.\n\nThough potent, the Russian military’s jamming capabilities are deployed unevenly across the more than 600 miles of frontline, and their armored vehicles are often easy targets because they usually don’t have jamming systems installed, Ukrainian soldiers said.\n\nUkraine’s approach to drones and electronic warfare has been funded and supplied in part by disparate groups outside of the military, including the country’s well-known IT sector. Each drone unit on the battlefield serves as a sort of test lab for new technologies, procurement and combat missions.\n\nRussia’s approach has been far more top down, with heavy military oversight. This has made the country’s drone fleet more predictable, with less variation in tactics and type. But it has also allowed the Russian military to jam Ukrainian drones on the battlefield without having to jam their own, by coordinating between flight paths and the jammers.\n\n“There is nothing like that on the Ukrainian side,” said one drone operator flying for Ukraine.\n\nThe lack of a broader command structure capable of coordinating drone units across the frontline often translates to confusion among Ukrainian troops. Drone operators can sometimes lose connection with their craft and end up looking through the camera of another drone.\n\nFPV drones fly on an analog frequency, and since many are store bought, they come out of the box set to the same frequency. Ukrainian drone units often need soldiers who are skilled in coding to change the frequency on a drone’s software.\n\nDev, a Ukrainian drone technician, rated this issue second in significance to Russian jamming capabilities.\n\n“There are many FPV groups operating at the front. The front is saturated with FPV groups, and there are no more frequency channels,” he said.\n\nLast month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a new part of the armed forces that, among other things, should improve the interaction of FPV units with one another.\n\nBut Russia’s ability to mass produce its drones on an industrial scale is also a pressing problem. Ukrainian troops said they are often forced to scrounge for their drones, despite pledges from the government to produce thousands of them.\n\nChef, a drone company commander in Ukraine’s east, said his unit flies about 20-30 FPV missions a day, depending on their supply of the drones, which comes almost entirely from volunteer donations. The government has barely supplied his unit, he said. Last July, they received a handful of them, and then again in December.\n\n“We launch as many as we produce,” he said. But “you can’t just use FPVs to win this war.”\n\nDzvinka Pinchuk contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.6850897058264,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Kyiv\n*   Virginia (where the Center for Naval Analyses is based)\n*   Kreminna\n*   Kremlin (referring to the seat of Russian government, located in Moscow)\n*   China (implied by \"Chinese made FPV quadcopter\")"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-129.7519073486328}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:37.586027Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Zd4daaviI8K2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6405},"candidatesTokenCount":77,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":77}],"promptTokenCount":1536,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1536}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1005,"totalTokenCount":2618,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.332439+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: The Maldives, a tiny tourism-dependent country of 500,000 people, barely registers as a blip alongside India and China, the world’s most populous nations. Yet every blip counts in the two giants’ competition for influence across South Asia, and that has set the Maldives on a zigzagging course between them.\n\nIndia, at the heart of the vast region, has long been its most powerful economic and military force. Still, China has made significant inroads with its much larger financial resources, signing infrastructure deals and securing access to ports in countries surrounding India.\n\nThe Maldives’ location makes it a strategic priority for both of Asia’s superpowers. China needs a military presence on the Arabian Sea to safeguard its access to oil from the Persian Gulf. And India, which has been clashing with China along their Himalayan border, wants to make sure that the Maldives, its island neighbor, doesn’t become too cozy with Beijing.\n\nIn January, India found itself in a sudden blowup with the Maldives over a perceived threat to the islands’ tourism lifeblood. But the great-power competition across the Maldives’ sky-blue lagoons has yet to reach a boil. Gains and losses are marked more by the tilts of the Maldives’ own politicians — more pro-India at some points, more pro-China at others — and, most of all, by the money that both sides spend to win Maldivian hearts and minds.\n\nFrom his high-rise office looking out over Malé’s marina, Mohamed Saeed, the Maldives’ minister of economic development and trade, puts his country’s needs in stark terms. Its economy is now worth about $6.5 billion a year, of which $6 billion is earned by tourism, and most of the rest by fishing tuna. The goal is to make it a $12 billion economy within the next five years.\n\nThe Maldives discovered tourist dollars in 1972, and it now draws more than a million visitors a year to the “water villas” that branch out from wooden boardwalks and define its high-end resorts.\n\nThe country became a democracy only in 2008, with the election of a charismatic young leader, Mohamed Nasheed. The current president, Mohamed Muizzu, was elected five months ago, in the latest swing of the pendulum between India and China. Mr. Muizzu took office after campaigning on an “India Out” platform, which called for expelling about 80 Indian military personnel stationed across the Maldives to provide support.\n\nMr. Saeed, a Muizzu appointee, was also a cabinet minister during the last “pro-China” government, when the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge was opened. He oversaw a free-trade agreement with China. But these days he sticks to the line that Mr. Muizzu’s government is pursuing only a “pro-Maldives” policy.\n\nThere is no preference for China, he says — “we extend our invitation of free trade to all countries,” because “we would like to get the best value for our tuna.”\n\nPursuing cordial relations with China and India simultaneously might seem the wisest course. But that became more difficult, said Mimrah Ghafoor, a writer and former career diplomat, as both countries stepped up their influence campaigns just as the Maldives was making its transition to democracy.\n\nChina has the deeper pockets, with development banks that dwarf India’s. But, Mr. Ghafoor noted, if China “has mostly carrots,” India “has both carrots and the stick.” That is because the Maldives depends on its near neighbor in times of intense need.\n\nMr. Ghafoor rattled off a list of crises in which Indian help proved indispensable, from fighting back a coup launched from Sri Lanka in 1988 to rescue work after the tsunami of 2004 to a delivery of 1,200 tons of freshwater by airplane and tanker during a shortage in 2014 — a time when the Maldives was led by a China-leaning president.\n\nBeyond money and geography, there is another important difference between India and China as competitors, one that was illustrated during the Maldives’ flare-up with India earlier this year.\n\nThree junior ministers attacked India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on social media after he had promoted his country’s own paradisal atoll, an even smaller and far less developed archipelago called Lakshadweep. These “India Out” Maldivians inferred a threat to their economy. In the much louder backlash, nationalistic Indians urged a boycott of the islands.\n\nThe disruption to relations offered a contrast with China, which exerts supreme message control. That gives it the ability to negotiate effectively with smaller countries behind closed doors. Beijing may be less comfortable with the Maldives’ new democracy than New Delhi is, but it has navigated relations just as adeptly.\n\nOne fierce democracy advocate, Eva Abdulla, a high-ranking member of Parliament, is proudly pro-India. But mostly she is anti-oscillation.\n\n“Flip-flopping on foreign policy is clearly not good for us,” she said. Not in terms of security, and “it doesn’t allow for any kind of stability in development projects.”\n\nMs. Abdulla, a cousin of Mr. Nasheed, the former president, argues that there are many reasons to stand by India as a partner. She mentions their cultural affinities, as South Asian democracies. Along with hospitals and schools on the far-flung islands, India funds things like a cultural center in Malé, to promote yoga and Indian dance.\n\nMr. Modi’s pro-Hindu policies at home rub many the wrong way in the Maldives, which is supposedly a 100 percent Muslim society. Even so, “we can’t afford a fistfight with India,” Ms. Abdulla said. On this, she and the president, Mr. Muizzu, whose parties will be battling each other in parliamentary elections in April, agree.\n\nMr. Muizzu has stepped up his calls for a generic Maldivian nationalism, in favor of the islands’ own language and its Islamic values, while steering clear of an anti-India tone. He has reluctantly made good on his promise to expel the Indian military personnel, but India has not quit its development projects.\n\nOne of the most visible is a giant expansion of an airport on the island of Hanimaadhoo, an hour’s flight north from Malé. It is home to one of the planes used by the Indian airmen. And it is the kind of project that makes some Maldivians fear that their sovereign territory is being prepared as a potential battleground in somebody else’s war.\n\nHanimaadhoo, population 2,664, hardly seems to need the extra runways being built by an Indian firm. Nor do the little-touristed islands nearby. Yet digging machines are at work 24 hours a day, in effect re-engineering the delicate island to make it capable of landing enormous aircraft. A similar airport, built by Indians at the opposite end of the country, makes Hanimaadhoo seem like part of a pattern.\n\nMaldivians are not the only ones to think that. An Indian laborer at the site named Ranjit said he thought it was obvious why India needed to build a military-ready facility here. “China is coming,” he said. “Don’t you see the Chinese ships getting ready?”\n\nOn Feb. 22, the Xiang Yang Hong 03, officially a Chinese research vessel, pulled into Malé. The Maldives’ government said it was just a port call. But as with the Indian airport projects, the ship left an air of ambiguity about possible military uses in its wake.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.5491568565368652,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1281,"startIndex":1046,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":2516,"startIndex":2100,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":3289,"startIndex":3045,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":3845,"startIndex":3574,"uri":"https://odu.news/2024/03/05/the-maldives-is-a-tiny-paradise-why-are-china-and-india-fighting-over-it/"},{"endIndex":4408,"startIndex":4102,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":5117,"startIndex":4773,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":5785,"startIndex":5418,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":6205,"startIndex":5867,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":6992,"startIndex":6457,"uri":"https://odu.news/2024/03/05/the-maldives-is-a-tiny-paradise-why-are-china-and-india-fighting-over-it/"},{"endIndex":7369,"startIndex":7036,"uri":"https://odu.news/2024/03/05/the-maldives-is-a-tiny-paradise-why-are-china-and-india-fighting-over-it/"},{"endIndex":7728,"startIndex":7417,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":8145,"startIndex":7837,"uri":"https://odu.news/2024/03/05/the-maldives-is-a-tiny-paradise-why-are-china-and-india-fighting-over-it/"},{"endIndex":8527,"startIndex":8180,"uri":"https://odu.news/2024/03/05/the-maldives-is-a-tiny-paradise-why-are-china-and-india-fighting-over-it/"},{"endIndex":8895,"startIndex":8635,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"},{"endIndex":9208,"startIndex":8942,"uri":"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/post-tribune/20240308/281616720332196"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Maldives\n*   India\n*   China\n*   South Asia\n*   Asia\n*   Arabian Sea\n*   Persian Gulf\n*   Himalayan border\n*   Beijing\n*   Malé\n*   Sri Lanka\n*   Lakshadweep\n*   New Delhi\n*   Hanimaadhoo"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-43.93254852294922}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.662770Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4dafK5KOuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":6044},"candidatesTokenCount":80,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":80}],"promptTokenCount":1613,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1613}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2332,"totalTokenCount":4025,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:45.167867+00:00"}

Often speaking in Tajik through a translator, he answered questions about his biography quietly and stammered, according to Mediazona.\n\nMr. Rachabalizoda, 30, had a large bandage hanging off the right side of his head where interrogators had sliced off a part of his ear and forced it into his mouth, the reports said, with the cutting captured in a video that spread online.\n\nThe judge allowed the press to witness only parts of the hearings, citing concerns that sensitive details about the investigation might be revealed or the lives of court workers put at risk.

Nikolai Yevmenov, the head of the Russian Navy for the past five years, was removed from command and replaced by the head of the Russia’s Northern Fleet.\n\nRussian publications, citing anonymous sources, reported on Sunday that Admiral Yevmenov had been fired. The Financial Times, citing Ukrainian officials, reported the development on Monday. The Russian government, however, has declined to confirm any of the personnel changes.\n\nU.S. officials have assessed that while Kyiv’s counteroffensive last year in eastern and southern Ukraine largely failed, its strikes on the Crimean Peninsula and attacks on the Black Sea Fleet were unexpectedly effective.\n\nThe victories have been all the more surprising because Ukraine does not have a traditional navy or a fleet of warships. Instead, Ukraine has used sea drones and missiles to attack Russian ships.\n\nU.S. officials believe Ukraine has sunk 15 Russian ships in the past six months. European officials have said the naval victories have reopened the western Black Sea, allowing Ukraine to again ship grain from Odesa.\n\nA Ukrainian military intelligence official said that Admiral Yevmenov’s removal from command was directly related to the loss of Russian ships.\n\nUkraine estimates that a third of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which once numbered 80 ships, has been destroyed since the war began two years ago. The April 2022 sinking of the Moskva, the Russian flagship, with a Ukrainian-built missile was one of Kyiv’s great symbolic victories.\n\nBut the more recent campaign has been as important for practical gains. As a result of the attacks, Russia has moved its fleet back from Ukraine’s coast and out of the western Black Sea.\n\nThe Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said on Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had “basically won the war over the control of the western half of the Black Sea.”\n\n“And Ukrainian grain is now again flowing through the Bosporus to Africa and China, which are Ukraine’s traditional markets,” Mr. Sikorski told reporters in Washington at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nAt a Senate hearing on Monday, William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said Ukraine would be able to conduct more strikes against Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet if the United States provided additional military assistance.\n\n“Ukraine can continue to exact costs against Russia, not only with deep penetration strikes in Crimea, but also against its Black Sea Fleet, continuing this success, which has resulted in 15 Russian ships sunk over the course of the last six months,” said Mr. Burns, who wrote in an article this year that Ukraine should double down on such tactics.\n\nUkrainian military analysts said the decision to replace the top naval commander was logical, given that Russian efforts to defend its fleet from attacks have failed.\n\n“What did the Russians do to increase the effectiveness of countering our strikes?” Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, told the Ukrainian news media. “Nothing. They currently have no effective solution to increase the security of their warships. The only viable solution they managed to implement was to flee from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk.”\n\nRussian publications have reported that Admiral Yevmenov will be replaced by the head of Russia’s Northern Fleet, Adm. Aleksandr A. Moiseyev. Admiral Yevmenov, however, is still listed as the naval commander in chief on the Russian military’s official website.\n\n“There are decrees classified as secret,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Monday. “I cannot comment on them. There were no open decrees published about this.”\n\nInstead, Russia’s military put out statements regarding naval operations, including one on Tuesday about Russian naval ships participating in joint exercises with Iran and China in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nIt is not the first time that questions about the leadership of the Russian Navy have gone unanswered in public.\n\nIn February, Russian Telegram channels that follow the country’s military reported that the Black Sea Fleet’s top officer had been removed, but he is still listed as the commander of the fleet on the Russian military’s website.\n\nLast year, Ukrainian authorities claimed to have killed the same commander, but Russia quickly rolled out footage of him giving an interview to prove he was alive.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.228053202155892,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1242,"startIndex":975,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":2327,"startIndex":2116,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":3103,"startIndex":2850,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":5184,"startIndex":4964,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":5310,"startIndex":5072,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":6169,"startIndex":5800,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":6618,"startIndex":6363,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"},{"endIndex":8025,"startIndex":7802,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/12/after-ukrainian-strikes-russia-fires-top-naval-commander/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Russia\n*   Ukraine\n*   Northern Fleet (refers to a region/area of command)\n*   U.S. (United States)\n*   Kyiv\n*   Crimean Peninsula (also referred to as Crimea)\n*   Black Sea\n*   Europe\n*   Odesa\n*   Poland\n*   Bosporus\n*   Africa\n*   China\n*   Washington (D.C.)\n*   Sevastopol\n*   Novorossiysk\n*   Kremlin\n*   Iran\n*   Gulf of Oman"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-160.87496948242188}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.697296Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dadDHKrH1x_AP3YWuoAQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3674},"candidatesTokenCount":131,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":131}],"promptTokenCount":894,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":894}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2447,"totalTokenCount":3472,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:54.264433+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Of the great musicians who have led this self-governing, proudly idiosyncratic orchestra, Leonard Bernstein and Pierre Boulez were made honorary members; Herbert von Karajan and Karl Böhm were given honorary conducting titles. The violinist Daniel Froschauer, the Philharmonic’s chairman, has said that today, the ensemble not so secretly has two maestros at the top of its roster: Riccardo Muti and Franz Welser-Möst.\n\nAt Carnegie Hall last weekend, it was the Austrian-born Welser-Möst, 63, who conducted three breathless, exhilarating and often moving performances by the Philharmonic, in meaty programs of Bruckner and Mahler symphonies, and works by Berg, Hindemith, Schoenberg, Strauss and Ravel.\n\nIt takes a lot to win over the affection of the Philharmonic, one of Europe’s finest ensembles, just as it takes a lot to join its ranks. These players — known for their lush sound, their brighter, higher tuning frequency and their distinctly Viennese articulation — can be haughty and stubborn; I have seen them outright defy a conductor in rehearsal.\n\nWelser-Möst has not only penetrated the Philharmonic’s inner circle, but also has done so while leading the Cleveland Orchestra — another top-notch ensemble, though one whose sound differs enormously from that of the Viennese.\n\nThe main difference between the Cleveland Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic is that while the Clevelanders have been criticized for giving performances that are too good, no one could ever accuse the Viennese of the same.\n\nIn Cleveland, Welser-Möst has for the past two decades maintained and deepened the orchestra’s transparent, clean sound. (He will leave his post in 2027.) Its playing is the most precise of any American ensemble, impeccably balanced to the delight of perfectionists and the frustration of those who crave more daring in their concerts.\n\nThe Philharmonic is also impressively skilled, but with a touch of messiness that tends to enliven rather than diminish a score. These players are, above all, human: Expressivity pervades their wide tremolos, wailing glissandos and physical gestures that verge on theatrical.\n\nIf the Clevelanders like their music lean, the Viennese like it fatty, “mit Schlag.” Together, these orchestras embody two approaches to musical excellence. And able to walk either path with them is Welser-Möst.\n\nAt Carnegie, the Philharmonic’s style was at its most pronounced in Bruckner and Mahler’s ninth symphonies — which were fitting inclusions in Welser-Möst’s Perspectives series at the hall, but not in its festival “Fall of the Weimar Republic: Dancing on the Precipice.”\n\nThe Weimar Republic, during its short life from 1918 to 1933, was an extraordinary period for all types of art. Audience members at the Philharmonic concerts, though, could barely glean that from its three programs, which only glanced at the era and grasped at thematic relevance. The performances more richly represented the Germanic world inching into modernism on the cusp of World War I, and the disillusioned mood of the war’s aftermath: the decline of Romanticism and the rise of embittered irony.\n\nThat idea can overlap with, but is not the same as, the precarity and collapse of the Weimar Republic. And where they met was the Philharmonic’s Saturday program, which opened with Hindemith’s Konzertmusik für Blasorchester, written in 1926 for a military band with the kind of satirical spirit you could hear on the revue stages of Berlin at the time. It was there that Schoenberg’s Variations for Orchestra premiered in 1928, disastrously mishandled by the Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtwängler. But at Carnegie both received easily legible readings; the Schoenberg, played with a comfort that let its underlying expressiveness come through, provided proof that “atonal” doesn’t inherently mean “unpleasant.”\n\nFrom there, the Philharmonic’s programming trailed away from the Weimar Republic, with works like Ravel’s “La Valse,” first performed not in Germany but in the Paris of 1920; and Strauss’s Symphonic Fantasy from “Die Frau Ohne Schatten,” a 1947 reworking of an opera written before and during World War I.\n\nWhich is not to discount the performances of these pieces. The Ravel unfurled like a dreamy memory of the Philharmonic’s famous New Year’s concerts — one that gives way to a nightmare. And the Strauss, difficult to balance with its large scale and dense writing, was an alluringly perfumed stroll through the luxuriant sound world of “Frau.”\n\nFurthest, perhaps, from the Weimar theme was the Bruckner, dedicated to God and left incomplete at the composer’s death in 1896. Welser-Möst likes to play with juxtaposition, and on Friday, he paired it, as something of a finale, with Berg’s Three Pieces for Orchestra, written in the 1910s — Berg’s music bringing Bruckner’s across the threshold of modernity.\n\nBruckner’s Ninth, discursive and inconclusive, at one point rivaling the mystery and mystical power of Wagner’s “Parsifal,” acquired dramatic shape and cohesion under Welser-Möst. Its introduction began quietly until it escalated to an explosive declaration, and the passages that followed rose and fell like a distress signal, flaring brightly and fading. From silences emerged wisps of melody and balletic delicacy, before more eruptions that left behind softly glowing halos of sound.\n\nThere was a similar sense of shape — a wrangling of immensity — in Mahler’s Ninth Symphony, which stood alone on Sunday. Welser-Möst took a brisk tempo, but with vitality rather than impatience, making for a running time of about 75 minutes where some conductors stretch the score to more than 90.\n\nThis is a work full of farewells: an allusion to Beethoven’s “Les Adieux” sonata, inscriptions by Mahler of “Leb’ wohl!” and an ending that quietly takes leave while, as Theodor Adorno wrote, looking questioningly into uncertainty.\n\nWelser-Möst’s interpretation was one with much to say on the way out. The first movement developed with defiant freedom before giving way, in later movements, to a ländler, a folk dance particularly popular in Austria, that began with rustic earthiness but ended with a cosmic dance, and, by the finale, a passionate elegy.\n\nThat last movement is often performed as a kind of prolonged death.

In 2023, China became ASML’s second-largest market, accounting for 29% of its revenue as Chinese companies bought up equipment before the licensing requirement took effect.\n\nRutte, speaking to journalists after his meeting, declined to go into specifics of the talks.\n\n“What I can tell you is that ... when we have to take measures, that they are never aimed at one country specifically, that we always try to make sure that the impact is limited, is not impacting the supply chain, and therefore is not impacting the overall economic relationship,” he said.\n\nThe Dutch leader, who was accompanied by Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen on the trip, said the top issue for him in their meetings with Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang was the war in Ukraine.\n\nChina has taken a neutral position on the war, providing Russia with diplomatic cover and economic support through trade. That stance has angered and frustrated much of Europe, which sees Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim.\n\nRutte said it's important for China to understand that \"this is a direct security threat for us, because if Russia will be successful in Ukraine, it will be a threat to the whole of Europe. It will not end with Ukraine.”\n\nHe added that he had asked China's leaders “to put their considerable weight — and they can do that as far as I'm concerned in a very discreet way — but as much as possible on Russia to influence the course of events.”\n\nASML, the Netherlands’ largest company, recently threatened to leave the country over anti-immigration policies that may impact the company’s ability to hire talent, leaving government officials scrambling to ensure that the firm does not leave.\n\nVan Leeuwen said this week in an interview with The FD, a Dutch business newspaper, that protecting the interests of ASML is a top priority but acknowledged that national security comes before economic interests.\n\nBeijing has repeatedly accused the U.S. of trying to hold back China’s economic development by restricting access to technology. In response, Xi has launched a campaign to develop home-grown chips and other high-tech products.\n\n“China always opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security and making various excuses to coerce other countries into imposing a technological blockade against China,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in January.\n\nRutte said that NATO and its growing ties with Asia did not come up at Wednesday’s talks. He is a leading candidate to be the next head of the alliance, which China has criticized for provoking regional tensions and making diplomatic forays into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n___\n\nSoo reported from Hong Kong.

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: * How do they select the Assembly?\n\n* When will we learn the result?\n\n* Where can I find out more?\n\nWhy does this election matter?\n\nSouth Korea​ns go to the polls on April 10 to select a new 300-member National Assembly. The parliamentary elections are widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol. They will also serve as a vote of confidence on the opposition Democratic Party, which has held majority control in the Assembly for the past four years.\n\nMr. Yoon won the presidential election in March 2022 by a razor-thin margin, and three months later, his People Power Party won the most big-city mayor and provincial governor races. But two major handicaps have hobbled his presidency: his party’s lack of control in the single-chamber Assembly and Mr. Yoon’s low approval ratings.\n\n​An electoral victory by his party could add momentum to Mr. Yoon’s four major reform programs involving the country’s health care, education, labor and national pension systems, as well as his promise to abolish the nation’s ministry of gender equality. Mr. Yoon will also see it as lending political legitimacy to his policy of aligning South Korea more closely with the United States.\n\nBut if the opposition scores a decisive win, it will further weaken Mr. Yoon’s leadership and may turn him into an early lame duck, political analysts say.\n\nWhat are the big election issues?\n\nSouth Korea faces a host of issues with no easy solution: a slowing economy, runaway housing prices, a rapidly aging population, a widening income gap, a gender divide especially among its young generation and a growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea.\n\nBut South Korea’s worsening political polarization means that practically every sensitive issue is seen through a partisan lens. And political analysts say that it also means that this election is run not on any sustained policy debate but more on stoking and playing to voters’ fears and resentments of the other side.\n\nSurveys in recent weeks showed that a majority of South Koreans disapproved of Mr. Yoon’s performance, which has emerged as a key election issue. He was unpopular especially among voters in their 50s and younger. But the same surveys also found respondents distrustful of the opposition Democratic Party, with its leader, Lee Jae-myung, standing trial on bribery and other criminal charges.\n\nMr. Yoon’s party appeals to conservative voters by arguing that its election victory would propel his campaign to drive out what he calls corrupt “anti-state” progressives from the center of South Korean politics.\n\nThe liberal opposition’s main catchphrase is to “punish” the Yoon government for everything from rising consumer prices to its veto of a parliamentary bill that would have launched an independent investigation into allegations of corruption against the first lady, Kim Keon Hee.\n\nHow do they select the Assembly?\n\nOf the 300 parliamentary seats up for grabs, 254 are elected through voting at as many electoral districts across the country. Those races will largely be a contest between the two main parties: Mr. Yoon’s People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party. The other 46 seats, not attached to any voting districts, are distributed among smaller political parties, roughly according to the numbers of votes they win in a parallel nationwide polling.\n\nPolitical parties did not finish nominating their candidates until less than a month before election day, giving voters little time to study them and the issues they stand for. But in South Korea, parliamentary elections are often decided more by the popularity of political parties and the sitting president than by the individual candidates.\n\nWhen will we learn the result?\n\nVoting begins at 6 a.m. local time, and, unless there’s an extremely tight race, it should be clear by early the next day which party has won.\n\nWhere can I find out more?\n\nThe President’s War Against ‘Fake News’ Raises Alarms in South Korea\n\nThe First Lady’s Dior Pouch Scandal Triggers Political Uproar\n\nSouth Korea’s Political Polarization\n\nKnife Attack on Opposition Leader Raises Alarms about South Korea’s Political Polarization\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-2.136069090470024,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1037,"startIndex":789,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":1409,"startIndex":1080,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":1836,"startIndex":1453,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":2476,"startIndex":2215,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":2897,"startIndex":2554,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":3333,"startIndex":2953,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":3632,"startIndex":3404,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":3963,"startIndex":3686,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":4525,"startIndex":4080,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"},{"endIndex":4935,"startIndex":4594,"uri":"https://dnyuz.com/2024/03/28/south-koreas-parliament-election-2024-what-you-need-to-know/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"The locations mentioned in the article are:\n\n*   South Korea\n*   United States\n*   North Korea"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-49.12958908081055}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.122065Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"ad4dadG5B8K2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3507},"candidatesTokenCount":23,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":23}],"promptTokenCount":868,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":868}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1371,"totalTokenCount":2262,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:49.633839+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: This year’s fires could be especially bad in two of the country’s most fire-prone provinces, where nearly 150 of the blazes that started during last year’s season are still burning this winter, under snow-covered ground.\n\nWhile so-called “zombie fires,” a term recently popularized in the Canadian media, are an annual phenomenon in parts of the country, never have so many fires been reported in a single winter, raising fears that many of them may flare up again above ground.\n\nThe “zombie fires” persist during winter because porous peat and moss ground cover in northern areas act as underground fuel for them.\n\nThe risk of wildfire in Canada has grown because of climate change, which increases the hot, dry and gusty conditions that have caused drought, according to research published last summer by World Weather Attribution, a group of scientists who model how climate change impacts extreme weather.\n\nGiven drought conditions in parts of Western Canada and other extreme weather effects, Harjit Sajjan, Canada’s emergency preparedness minister, said it was not surprising that the wildfire forecast was “alarming.”\n\nHe added that climate change “is the reality that we face and we need to get ready for it.”\n\nMany of the underground fires — which are burning in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta — don’t pose an increased risk of triggering wildfires in the spring because they are in places so charred that there is no vegetation left to burn.\n\nBut others are in areas that droughts have turned into tinder boxes, prompting fears that they will cause fires to erupt above ground once spring arrives.\n\nLast year’s wildfires burned about 48 million acres of forest across Canada, an area roughly the size of Finland, and a staggering increase of 170 percent over the previous year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center.\n\nSmoke from the fires, particularly blazes that burned in Quebec, wafted as far south as Florida and blanketed several cities in the United States and southern Canada in a noxious cloud.\n\nThe drought in Western Canada is now entering its third year and is a major factor behind fears of an even worse 2024 fire season, particularly in British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nBoth provinces have already seen new aboveground wildfires this year, prompting Alberta to declare a start to its wildfire season about a week before the traditional March 1 start date.\n\nSnow could still fall in the spring and tame the existing fires and help with the dry conditions, said Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildfire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\nBut this year, he added, long-range forecasts suggest continued dryness and warmer than usual temperatures.\n\nAbout 93 fires left over from last year have continued to burn underground through the winter in British Columbia, while 55 are burning in Alberta, according to their provincial governments.\n\nSuch winter fires are common in both provinces, as well as in Yukon, but, in British Columbia, there are usually no more than about 15, experts said, adding that this year’s much higher tally has left them surprised and worried.\n\n“There’s no historical analog to what we’re seeing right now,” Professor Flannigan said. “Most years they’re not a big deal. But now a lot of these fires have the potential that when the snow melts and it gets warm, dry and windy to actually grow again. So it is a serious issue.”\n\nNo overwinter fires have been recorded in the forests of Quebec, the eastern province that sent smoke billowing into the United States and at one point across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Quebec generally lacks the peat and moss soil of the western provinces that serve as fuel for winter fires.\n\nSince the winter fires are underground and can produce little or no visible smoke, tracking them can be a challenge. The wildfire service for British Columbia said that it relied on sensors in airplanes and satellites to look for heat, though snow cover reduces their effectiveness.\n\nStill, some fires have been visible to the naked eye.\n\n“Even on the -40, -42 Celsius days, we were still seeing smoke,’’ said Sonja E.R. Leverkus, the senior fire lead at Northern Fire Worx, a private wildfire fighting service in a remote section of northeastern British Columbia. “So much that as you drove you’d be smelling the smoke and coughing in your truck.”\n\nIn a typical year, melting snow seeps into the ground where winter fires burn and snuffs most of them out. But this year there has been far less snow than usual, said Dr. Leverkus, who holds a doctorate in fire ecology.\n\n“I am 6 foot 2, and there have been times in the past few years that snow on my apple orchard has been well above my hips,” she said, adding that there was less than a foot on the ground.\n\nMr. Sajjan, the emergency preparedness minister, said that Canada was better prepared this year to fight fires and evacuate communities. While provinces and territories are responsible for fighting fires, federal money has provided for the training of an additional 600 firefighters across the country.\n\nA system meant to allow provinces to share personnel and equipment has been revamped to make it more efficient and accelerate the exchange of information, Mr. Sajjan said.\n\nEquipment stocks have been increased, he added, and new techniques and technologies — including nighttime firefighting — are being introduced or tested.\n\nWhile the forecast for this year’s wildfire season seems dire, Professor Flannigan stressed that it was still only a prediction.\n\n“I don’t expect to see another year like 2023 in my lifetime, but I could be wrong,” he said.\n\nStill, he added, the long-term outlook for Canada was discouraging.\n\n“Most every year is going to be a bad fire year,” Professor Flannigan said. “But on average, we’re going to see a lot more fire, a lot more smoke. This trend is going to continue.”\n\nIn Fort Nelson, British Columbia, Dr. Leverkus, whose crew numbers over 100 at the peak of fire season, said she was still haunted by the eight deaths among firefighters in Canada last year. Two of them occurred in areas near where her crews were working.\n\n“Last year was horrible,” she said. “My crew and I, we listen to what the land is telling us. And the land is telling us that it’s dry, and the animals are telling us that it’s dry and to be ready.”\n\nVjosa Isai contributed research.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.593379020690918,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Canada\n*   British Columbia\n*   Alberta\n*   Western Canada\n*   Finland\n*   Quebec\n*   Florida\n*   United States\n*   southern Canada\n*   Kamloops\n*   Yukon\n*   Atlantic Ocean\n*   Europe\n*   northeastern British Columbia\n*   Fort Nelson"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-47.47032165527344}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:34.672681Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yt4daamHKZe6xfcPr8Wg-AE","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5329},"candidatesTokenCount":80,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":80}],"promptTokenCount":1373,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1373}],"thoughtsTokenCount":776,"totalTokenCount":2229,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.127948+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: In 2024, crimson, emerald, indigo and saffron clouds will hover over the country on March 25 for one of its most vibrant, joyful and colorful festivals.\n\n“Playing Holi,” as Indians say, has spread far beyond India’s borders.\n\nThe revelry starts at sundown.\n\nHoli (pronounced “holy”), also known as the “festival of colors,” starts on the evening of the full moon during the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around February or March.\n\nIt begins with the kindling of bonfires. People gather around the flames to sing, dance and pray for an evening ritual called Holika Dahan, which re-enacts the demise of a Hindu demoness, Holika.\n\nAll sorts of things are thrown into the fires, like wood, leaves and food, in a symbolic purge of evil and triumph of good.\n\nFrom Delhi, Archie Singhal, 24, visits her family in Gujarat the day before Holi, when the fire is lit in the evening. The next morning, she prepares for the bursts of powder, called gulal, by applying oil on her body so the colors don’t stick to her skin. She puts on old clothes she doesn’t mind tossing.\n\nWhy the colors?\n\nHoli’s roots are in Hinduism. The god Krishna, cursed by a demon with blue skin, complained to his mother, asking why his love interest Radha is fair while he is not. His mother, Yashoda, playfully suggests that he paint Radha’s face with any colors he wishes. So Krishna smears color on her so they look alike.\n\nHoli is in part a celebration of the love between Krishna and Radha that looks past differences. Today, some of the gulal used during Holi is synthetic. But the colors traditionally come from natural ingredients, such as dried flowers, turmeric, dried leaves, grapes, berries, beetroot and tea.\n\n“There is an environment of freedom,” Ms. Singhal said, adding that she doesn’t hesitate to throw colors on her younger brother, parents, aunts, uncles and neighbors.\n\nEveryone takes part.\n\nThe ancient Hindu festival eschews the religious, societal, caste and political divisions that underpin India’s often sectarian society. Hindu or not, anybody can be splashed with brightly colored dust, or even eggs and beer.\n\nSome partake in worship, called puja, offering prayers to the gods. For others, Holi is a celebration of community. The festival gets everyone involved — including innocent passers-by.\n\n“People forget their misunderstandings or enmity during this occasion and again become friends,” said Ratikanta Singh, 63, who writes, sometimes about Holi, in Assam, in northeastern India.\n\nThere’s a feast.\n\nWhen not throwing around gulal, friends, families and neighbors partake in a buffet of traditional dishes and drinks. They include gujiya, dumpling-like fried sweets filled with dried fruits and nuts; dahi vada, deep-fried lentil fritters served with yogurt; and kanji, a traditional drink made by fermenting carrots in water and spices.\n\nSome celebrate Holi with thandai, a light green concoction of milk, rose petals, cardamom, almonds, fennel seeds and other ingredients. For thousands of years, the drink has sometimes been laced with bhang, or crushed marijuana leaves, which add to the mood of revelry.\n\nHoli has ancient roots.\n\nHoli has been documented for centuries in Hindu texts. The tradition is observed by people young and old, particularly in Northern India and Nepal, where the stories behind the festival originated.\n\nHoli also marks the harvesting of crops with the arrival of spring in India, where more than half of the population lives in rural areas.\n\nTraditions vary across India.\n\nHoli celebrations are as diverse as the Indian subcontinent. They are particularly wild in North India, considered the birthplace of the Hindu god Krishna, where celebrations can last more than a week.\n\nIn Mathura, a northern city where Krishna is said to have been born, people recreate a Hindu story in which Krishna visits Radha to romance her, and her cowherd friends, taking offense at his advances, drive him out with sticks.\n\nIn the eastern state of Odisha, people hold a dayslong festival called Dola Purnima. Grand processions of people shouldering richly decorated carriages with idols of Hindu gods are a large part of the festivities there. The processions are full of drumbeats, songs, colorful powder and flower petals thrown into the air.\n\nIn southern India, where Holi is not celebrated as widely, many temples carry out religious rites. In the Kudumbi tribal community, in the southwest, temples cut areca palms and transport their trunks to the shrine in a ritual that symbolizes the victory good over evil.\n\nIt’s not just in India.\n\nHoli is celebrated around the world, wherever the Indian diaspora has gone. More than 32 million Indians and people of Indian origin are overseas, most in the United States, where 4.4 million reside, according to the Indian government.\n\nIt is also widely enjoyed in countries as varied as Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Britain and other parts of Europe.\n\nHoli is known as Phagwah in the Indian communities of the Caribbean, including in Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe festival has also been used by the Indian government to project soft power and reshape its image as part of its “Incredible India” tourism campaign.\n\nOn Holi, “the world is a global village,” said Shubham Sachdeva, 29, from an eastern Delhi suburb, who added that his friends in the United States were celebrating Holi with their roommates whether they were Indian or not. “All this brings the world close to each other.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.864528378573331,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1284,"startIndex":897,"uri":"https://www.ghtn.in/post/global-hindu-temple-network-2"},{"endIndex":1559,"startIndex":1305,"uri":"https://www.modbee.com/news/nation-world/world/article286988215.html"},{"endIndex":2503,"startIndex":1985,"uri":"https://www.modbee.com/news/nation-world/world/article286988215.html"},{"endIndex":3132,"startIndex":2853,"uri":"https://www.modbee.com/news/nation-world/world/article286988215.html"},{"endIndex":4036,"startIndex":3425,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":5160,"startIndex":4931,"uri":"https://asia.wiki/article/indias-most-colorful-festival-holi/"},{"endIndex":5660,"startIndex":5315,"uri":"https://asia.wiki/article/indias-most-colorful-festival-holi/"},{"endIndex":6423,"startIndex":6181,"uri":"https://www.modbee.com/news/nation-world/world/article286988215.html"},{"endIndex":7478,"startIndex":7251,"uri":"https://www.modbee.com/news/nation-world/world/article286988215.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   India\n*   Delhi\n*   Gujarat\n*   Assam\n*   Northern India (also referred to as North India)\n*   Nepal\n*   Indian subcontinent\n*   Mathura\n*   Odisha\n*   Southern India\n*   United States\n*   Fiji\n*   Mauritius\n*   South Africa\n*   Britain\n*   Europe\n*   Caribbean\n*   Guyana\n*   Suriname\n*   Trinidad and Tobago"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-95.0981216430664}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:33.155112Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Yd4daei7CbH1x_AP3YWuoAQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":4593},"candidatesTokenCount":110,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":110}],"promptTokenCount":1199,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1199}],"thoughtsTokenCount":2114,"totalTokenCount":3423,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:43.189355+00:00"}

He said Iran has received no official signals from Damascus on resuming relations.\n\nThe remarks follow an alleged diplomatic incident involving Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Syrian authorities reportedly refused to allow Larijani's aircraft to enter Syrian airspace en route to Lebanon from Iraq on 13 August, forcing it to fly a longer route via Turkey to reach Beirut.\n\nAraqchi declined to confirm details of that event but acknowledged the presence of potential intermediaries and said Iran prefers to wait for suitable conditions before any re-engagement.\n\nIran weighs limited IAEA engagement amid snapback tensions\n\nAraqchi in the same interview indicated Tehran may send a delegation to Vienna for talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stating a complete halt to cooperation is \"not feasible.\"\n\nAraqchi cited the imminent need for IAEA inspectors to oversee a fuel replacement at the Bushehr nuclear power plant as a practical reason for maintaining limited engagement. However, he stressed that any return of inspectors would require approval from Iran's Supreme National Security Council, in line with a parliamentary law mandating a suspension of cooperation until Iran's enrichment rights are recognised.\n\nAraqchi dismissed the legal authority of the E3 (UK, France, Germany) to trigger a snapback of pre-2015 UN sanctions but conceded it remains a possibility. He revealed that Iran has developed a coordinated response plan with Russia and China should the mechanism be activated.\n\nRegarding the US, Araqchi ruled out an imminent resumption of talks, stating the necessary \"negotiation maturity\" is absent.\n\nHe said that demanding compensation for recent US bombing damage was not a direct precondition but insisted the issue must be addressed within any future negotiation framework.\n\nTop security official meets Swiss envoy amid stalled nuclear talks\n\nLarijani met senior Swiss diplomat Gabriel Luchinger in Tehran yesterday to discuss regional developments and the stalled nuclear negotiations. Switzerland, which represents US interests in Iran, reportedly agreed to share the outcomes of its discussions with other relevant parties with Iran.\n\nA report by Al-Mayadeen claimed the Swiss envoy delivered a US message offering talks with guarantees against military action, but a US official later denied this.

Pakistan's main and strategic goal is to turn Afghanistan into its fifth province.\"\n\nWhen asked why Pakistan has always voiced concern about security threats emanating from Afghanistan, Hassan said: \"Neither Pakistan nor Iran want Afghanistan to have a powerful centralised government and a powerful nation that can stand on their own feet. They have always wanted Afghanistan to be in peril and be a servant as well as a puppet.\"\n\nCommenting on the deportation of Afghan refugees, US-based political pundit Zaman Stanikzai, who joined the debate online, said: \"If the refugees return to Afghanistan from Pakistan, Pakistanis will not have any tool to pressure Afghanistan or the Afghan government.\"\n\nStanikzai said that the Taliban administration should spare no effort to gain the full support of Afghan nationals to get rid of Pakistan's continuous pressure.\n\n\"The Taliban need to win people's trust and support.

At least one assailant smashed his car window, sprayed him with tear gas and began beating him with a hammer, Mr. Navalny’s press secretary, Kira Yarmysh, said in a statement released on X and in other comments she gave to Russian media.\n\nMr. Volkov survived the attack.\n\nPhotographs posted online by another top aide to Mr. Navalny showed Mr. Volkov conscious but injured, with a mark on his head and blood streaming from one leg. Other photographs showed the bashed-in window of his car, which was parked in a driveway in front of a children’s basketball hoop. Later in the evening, the aide posted a photograph of Mr. Volkov being loaded into an ambulance and taken to the hospital.\n\n“He began to fight back with the car door and with his legs,” Ms. Yarmysh told the exiled Russian news outlet Meduza. “Therefore, they hit him where they could — on his legs.”\n\nThe identity of those behind the assault was unknown as of Tuesday night, and it was not immediately clear whether there was one attacker, or more.\n\nThe assault on Mr. Volkov happened nearly a month after Mr. Navalny’s death in prison, in circumstances that have not yet been explained.\n\nThe opposition campaigner’s wife and aides accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of murdering Mr. Navalny. President Biden said Mr. Putin “and his thugs” were responsible for his death. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. The Russian prison service said Mr. Navalny had collapsed while taking a walk outside his cell.\n\nThe attack Tuesday night comes amid broader worries about the safety of those continuing Mr. Navalny’s work from abroad. Hours before the attack, Mr. Volkov was asked in an interview with Meduza about the main risks for Mr. Navalny’s organization. He replied: “The key risk is that we will all be killed.”\n\nChristo Grozev, a Bulgarian journalist who exposed the Russian intelligence unit behind a 2020 poisoning of Mr. Navalny in an investigation featured in the Oscar-winning documentary “Navalny,” issued a warning in Russian on X after the attack on Mr. Volkov. “The great terror of a small dictator has begun,” Mr. Grozev said. “Activists, journalists and simply free-thinking people — be careful. Don’t be afraid, but be careful. Don’t make things easier for brainless bandits.”\n\nThe Lithuanian police confirmed that a Russian citizen, whom they did not name, was beaten outside his home in Vilnius shortly after 10 p.m. local time, according to the Baltic news outlet Delfi.\n\n“News about Leonid’s assault are shocking. Relevant authorities are at work,” Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s minister of foreign affairs, said in a statement on X. “Perpetrators will have to answer for their crime.”\n\nMr. Volkov, a former software-company executive who ran Mr. Navalny’s nationwide network of regional offices in Russia, fled to Lithuania in 2019, as Russian authorities cracked down on Mr. Navalny’s anticorruption organization and opened criminal cases against his aides.\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Volkov had been leading calls for “Noon Against Putin,” a plan for Russians who oppose the president to show up together at the country’s polls at 12 p.m. on the last day of this weekend’s presidential election.\n\nBefore his death, Mr. Navalny had supported the idea as a way for Russians to register resistance without risking arrest. Mr. Volkov has called on Russians to execute the plan as a way to honor the opposition leader’s last wishes.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-4.252053437409578,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":3034,"startIndex":2819,"uri":"https://www.rsn.org/001/top-navalny-aide-attacked-with-hammer-outside-home-in-lithuania.html"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Vilnius\n*   Russia\n*   Kremlin\n*   Lithuania"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-114.8054428100586}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.046714Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dafrsAuuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2998},"candidatesTokenCount":27,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":27}],"promptTokenCount":814,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":814}],"thoughtsTokenCount":946,"totalTokenCount":1787,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:38.049914+00:00"}
{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Deep into the cataloging process, Mr. van Haasteren was cleaning the mud from yet another bone when something unexpected happened: Hundreds of black specks the size of poppy seeds came pouring out from one end.\n\nThe specks turned out to be seeds of black henbane, a potently poisonous member of the nightshade family that can be medicinal or hallucinogenic depending on the dosage. The bone — hollowed-out and sealed with a tar plug — was an ancient stash pouch that had kept the seeds safe for some 1,900 years.\n\nResearchers determined that the bone was deposited in the pit somewhere between A.D. 70 and 100 — a time when the Netherlands represented the Roman Empire’s northern border. Parts of the container were smooth, suggesting frequent handling.\n\nThis “very special” discovery provides the first definitive evidence that Indigenous people living in such a far-flung Roman province had knowledge of black henbane’s powerful properties, said Maaike Groot, an archaeozoologist at the Free University of Berlin and a co-author of a paper published in the journal Antiquity last month describing the finding.\n\nAt the time that the original owner stuffed the container full of seeds, the properties of black henbane were already well known in Rome. Writings by Pliny the Elder and others testify to the medicinal use of black henbane seeds and leaves, but warn that an overindulgence will result in mind-altering effects.\n\nThe plant was mostly used during Roman times as an ointment for pain relief, although some sources also reference smoking its seeds or adding its leaves to wine. It seems its psychedelic effects came to the fore in the Middle Ages, when black henbane became associated “with witches and summoning demons,” said Mr. van Haasteren, who is a co-author of the paper.\n\nWhether Roman knowledge of black henbane’s special properties traveled to the empire’s more distant corners — or whether this knowledge might have been developed independently by local communities — has been a difficult question for scholars to answer.\n\nBlack henbane has been found at archaeological sites in the Netherlands that date back to the Neolithic Period. But because it is a wild plant that readily grows in the disturbed soil near settlements, experts have been unable to ascertain whether it was used by people or was just part of the environment.\n\nIn 2008, for example, archaeologists found a Roman-Era ceramic beaker in Voorburg that had been filled with dirt over time. In the dirt, they found one black henbane seed along with 26 hazelnuts and a single grain each of corn, barley, wheat and various other seeds. “The overall composition of the seeds seemed to point at the intentional use of black henbane as some kind of medicine or hallucinogen,” said Jasper de Bruin, the curator of the “Netherlands in Roman Times” collection at the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nHowever, according to Laura Kooistra, a retired archaeobotanist and a co-author on the latest findings, a single seed embedded in soil does not provide the degree of certainty needed to draw conclusions about whether black henbane was used by people. “One swallow does not make a summer,” she said.\n\nThe bone container, on the other hand, does provide that level of smoking-gun evidence. “It shows, for the first time in Western Europe, the deliberate collection of seeds of the poisonous black henbane during the Roman Period,” said Otto Brinkkemper, an archaeobotanist at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, who was not involved in the research.\n\nExperts can only guess, though, what purpose the seeds might have served.\n\nThe authors of the new study refer to black henbane as a medicinal plant, said Astrid Van Oyen, an archaeologist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, who was not involved in the research. But it is also possible that black henbane was used by people “actively seeking psychoactive experiences” for spiritual, therapeutic or recreational purposes, she said.\n\n“This find shows us a rare glimpse of a possible way in which people navigated and mediated the anxieties, stresses, hopes and aspirations of daily life,” Dr. Van Oyen said. “Whoever collected all these seeds in this makeshift container did this deliberately and skillfully — they knew what they were doing.”\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-1.4467601370304188,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1116,"startIndex":754,"uri":"https://artdaily.cc/news/167837/Long-before-Amsterdam-s-coffee-shops--there-were-hallucinogenic-seeds"},{"endIndex":1826,"startIndex":1574,"uri":"https://artdaily.cc/news/167837/Long-before-Amsterdam-s-coffee-shops--there-were-hallucinogenic-seeds"},{"endIndex":2637,"startIndex":2325,"uri":"https://bodyhealth.co.in/long-before-amsterdams-coffee-shops-there-were-hallucinogenic-seeds/"},{"endIndex":3240,"startIndex":2872,"uri":"https://bodyhealth.co.in/long-before-amsterdams-coffee-shops-there-were-hallucinogenic-seeds/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Netherlands\n*   Roman Empire\n*   Berlin\n*   Rome\n*   Voorburg\n*   Leiden\n*   Western Europe\n*   Nijmegen"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-67.99772644042969}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.006821Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"Y94daaU165KY0A_2m-XQBA","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3652},"candidatesTokenCount":47,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":47}],"promptTokenCount":911,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":911}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1071,"totalTokenCount":2029,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:41.256729+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Khan noted within the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), which is the largest party in the ruling coalition, voices are being raised about it being a mistake to take over the government. She was of the view that this is because party members have realised that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) future politics would be focused on highlighting the alleged injustices done to it and it would also keep criticising the government for its tough decisions.\n\nKhan asked journalist Irshad Bhatti to share his views on the PML-N apparently regretting its decision to take over the government. Bhatti commented \"the biggest challenge for the government is the government itself\" because the country is facing the worst economic and political crisis and both these crises are \"supplementing each other\". He said there is no hope that the government would improve the economy and claimed no country trusts it. He added whatever steps are to be taken for the economy would be taken by the military. He alleged there is a power struggle going on within the Sharif family.\n\nBhatti further alleged there is a rift between Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif; another rift is between the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the federal government; and there is yet another rift between the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N, particularly over privatisation of state enterprises. He added another rift has emerged between Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb and former finance minister Ishaq Dar.\n\nSenior journalist Sana Bucha commented this is not a government but a \"standby agreement or a standby adjustment phase\" through which the country is passing. She appreciated Mohsin Naqvi's performance as the former chief minister of Punjab and said it is good that he is the interior minister now. She added Naqvi has \"zero interests politically and personally\", so he would be on the right path.\n\nTalking about Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Bucha said he wants what he considers to be \"his share in the government\" and that is why he was being given the chairmanship of an economic coordination committee. She was of the view that if the PTI wanted to come into power, it should have made a coalition government along with the PPP, but it \"only wanted to keep making noise\".\n\nSenior analyst Raza Rumi said at the moment, governance in the country is in the \"grip of factionalism\" and various \"factions\" within the PML-N-led government and power centres are exercising their influence. He noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is trying to take several factions along, so it looks like people would see a \"struggling prime minister\" in the coming months. He remarked it should be kept in mind that coalition governments always work in this manner.\n\nCommenting on inclusion of Mohsin Naqvi in the cabinet and appointment of former caretaker interior minister Sarfraz Bugti as the chief minister of Balochistan, Rumi said these appointments are \"against the spirit of the Constitution\" because caretakers should not join the government formed after elections. He was of the view that running the government would be difficult for the prime minister and the present situation is \"not good for the future of democracy\" in the country.\n\nBhatti said Ishaq Dar has been appointed as the foreign minister at a time when the \"foreign image of Pakistan is very bad\" and all the battles are to be fought on the foreign policy front. He noted friendly countries are no longer willing to provide financial support to Pakistan.\n\nKhan played a clip of a statement by PTI politician Asad Qaiser, who said the PTI would launch a protest movement and not let the government \"sit in peace\". Commenting on the situation, Bhatti insisted political stability would not be possible without holding talks with the PTI or its founder Imran Khan. He added there is a need for a \"charter of Pakistan\".\n\nRumi remarked political stability has never been there in Pakistan, except during the years under the military's rule, so people should not be \"idealistic\" in this regard. He was of the view that the \"hybrid system\" which has been created would work for the time being. He said the present government could be changed if the PTI decides to give up its narrative that it would not talk to other parties and forms a coalition. However, he added, the PTI is not likely to change its stance because its popularity depends on the narrative that it is the only \"clean party\" and all other politicians are \"thieves and robbers\".\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1700 GMT 24 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.8850846901918069,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n*   Punjab\n*   Balochistan\n*   Lahore"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-34.51830291748047}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.054229Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dadWnA7H1x_AP3YWuoAQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3872},"candidatesTokenCount":39,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":39}],"promptTokenCount":963,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":963}],"thoughtsTokenCount":554,"totalTokenCount":1556,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:35.692492+00:00"}

Reinforced defence, together with support for Ukraine, is the best investment in the security of NATO as a whole. The Alliance's defence must not be weakened, and Lithuania, for its part, has been increasing its defence budget in recent years and will continue to build its national defence, the Lithuanian prime minister added.\n\nLithuania highly values Poland's contributions to regional security, bilateral defence cooperation, and is eager to further enhance these ties, Simonyte noted.\n\nThe prime minister stressed the need to sustain and intensify pressure through sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, while also striving for more effective implementation of the existing sanctions.\n\nWhile current efforts are focused on security, Prime Minister Simonyte also recognised the increasingly strong bilateral cooperation spanning from infrastructure to cultural exchanges.\n\nIngrida Simonyte thanked Donald Tusk for excellent partnership and commitment to joint work towards interconnecting the Baltic electricity grids with continental Europe via Poland by February 2025.\n\nThe prime minister also said that the transport links that the two countries are developing - the Rail Baltica and Via Baltica - are not only significant projects in terms of the security of the region, but they also bring real, practical benefits to the people of both countries.\n\nSource: ELTA, Vilnius, in English 0650 gmt 5 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.7852796800065749,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1113,"startIndex":807,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":1825,"startIndex":1369,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":2318,"startIndex":1954,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":2857,"startIndex":2407,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":3377,"startIndex":3152,"title":"Your prompt"},{"endIndex":4201,"startIndex":3917,"title":"Your prompt"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Ukraine\n*   Russia\n*   Belarus\n*   EU (European Union)\n*   Washington (referring to the NATO Summit location)\n*   Lithuania\n*   Poland\n*   Baltic (referring to the Baltic electricity grids)\n*   Europe (continental Europe)\n*   Rail Baltica (infrastructure project)\n*   Via Baltica (infrastructure project)\n*   Vilnius (source location)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-79.31324768066406}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.801427Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4daZP1MOuSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":2443},"candidatesTokenCount":101,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":101}],"promptTokenCount":557,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":557}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1169,"totalTokenCount":1827,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:40.012124+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Bassirou Diomaye Faye is the anointed candidate of Senegal’s popular and controversial opposition politician Ousmane Sonko. Mr. Faye’s main rival, the governing party candidate Amadou Ba, conceded in a statement congratulating his rival on Monday for winning in the first round.\n\nMr. Faye, who celebrated his 44th birthday on Monday, will become the West African country’s youngest ever president, and the youngest elected president currently serving in Africa. (There are younger leaders, but they came to power by force.) He had been jailed on charges of defamation and contempt of court, and was awaiting trial.\n\n“I wish him a lot of success, for the well-being of the Senegalese people,” Mr. Ba said in a statement released Monday afternoon that addressed Mr. Faye as president.\n\nThe national electoral commission has not yet announced the tally, but Mr. Ba’s concession followed reports by local media that Mr. Faye had won more than 50 percent of the vote, ruling out a runoff.\n\nMr. Faye and Mr. Sonko have captivated young people by excoriating political elites, pledging to renegotiate contracts with oil and gas companies, and promising “monetary sovereignty” — Senegal is one of 14 countries that use the CFA, a currency pegged to the euro and backed by France.\n\nMr. Ba, who stepped down as prime minister in order to campaign, was backed by Senegal’s president, Macky Sall. Mr. Sall had served two terms, and for years refused to say whether he would try for a third. He threw the country into chaos when he suddenly called off the election, which was supposed to happen in February, and then, almost as suddenly, changed course.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Sall also congratulated Mr. Faye, saying that the smooth election was a “victory for Senegalese democracy” — a democracy that the outgoing president’s critics had accused him of trying to subvert.\n\nSenegal, a mainly Muslim country of 17 million people, has a history of peaceful transfers of power since gaining independence from France in 1960.\n\nResidents of Dakar, Senegal’s coastal capital, began celebrating at 8 p.m. on Sunday, before many polling stations had even had a chance to count the contents of their ballot boxes. People danced, waved flags, and piled into cars and onto motorcycles, sounding a cacophony of horns and shouting “Get out, Amadou Ba!” as they raced through the streets.\n\nAnd at midnight, supporters began to sing “Happy Birthday” to Mr. Faye, who has gone from obscurity to winning the presidency in a few short months.\n\nBut Mr. Faye was not the only winner. Many Senegalese casting their ballots for him saw him merely as a proxy for Mr. Sonko, 49, a fiery orator who was jailed and barred from running, and who tapped Mr. Faye to run in his place.\n\nMr. Faye is a former tax collector who was jailed on charges of defamation and contempt of court, after he accused magistrates of persecuting Mr. Sonko, who was himself convicted of defamation and, separately, of corrupting a minor, after he was accused of raping a young massage parlor employee.\n\nMr. Sonko has been eager to emphasize that a vote for Mr. Faye, known to many as Diomaye, was a vote for him.\n\n“Diomaye is Sonko,” read ubiquitous posters bearing the two men’s youthful, glowing faces.\n\nThe two men have very different styles. In contrast with Mr. Sonko’s bombast, Mr. Faye is soft-spoken and serious, some who know him say. He is a keen soccer player who grew up in his family village near the city of Mbour and has two wives. He worked for 15 years in Senegal’s civil service.\n\n“Many young Senegalese identify with him,” said Babacar Ndiaye, a political analyst at the West Africa Think Tank. He said that Mr. Faye had worked extensively on the party’s political program, and had earned a reputation for being ethical and hard-working. When Mr. Sonko chose him to be the presidential candidate in his place, Mr. Ndiaye said, “Everyone thought it was the right choice.”\n\nMr. Faye has pledged to reduce presidential powers, to make the judiciary more independent, and to reform land ownership. He has also said he will “change the CFA” — the regional currency — though it is unclear whether he and Mr. Sonko intend to reform or replace it.\n\nThe election Sunday unspooled peacefully, with many voters arriving early at polling stations and lining up quietly to cast their ballots.\n\nIt was in stark contrast to the previous two months, during which it was often unclear whether the poll would take place at all.\n\nIn early February, Mr. Sall stunned the nation when he called off the election, saying that there were allegations of corruption that needed investigation at the constitutional council, the country’s highest court.\n\nThen the police occupied Parliament, throwing out opposition lawmakers so that legislation confirming Mr. Sall’s decision could be pushed through. The presidential election was postponed until December.\n\nIn the uproar that followed, the constitutional council ruled the delay unlawful, and Mr. Sall performed a U-turn. He agreed to hold the election quickly, and even released Mr. Sonko and Mr. Faye from jail, allowing them a quick-fire 10-day campaign.\n\nMany observers saw the turn of events as proof of the resilience of democracy in Senegal, a country in a tough neighborhood. A string of West African countries — like Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali — have experienced coups in recent years, and Senegal has been held up as an outpost of democracy and relative political stability.\n\nOpposition candidates conceded one by one Sunday night through to Monday, congratulating Mr. Faye.\n\nOver the past five years Mr. Sonko has grown his following significantly by excoriating Senegal’s political elites and evoking the vague but charged concept of “sovereignty,” aiming his rhetoric at Senegal’s abundant youth — half of the population is under 19.\n\nAnd the youth have responded. Thousands have taken to the streets in support of Mr. Sonko, dozens of them losing their lives at the hands of the police.\n\nDespite the crackdowns, young people have continued to show their support for what many simply call “the project” — Mr. Faye’s and Mr. Sonko’s plan for the country.\n\n“I know with the project, many things will change,” said Abalaye Diop, 27, a motorcycle taxi driver who lives in Medina, a busy Dakar neighborhood, on Monday afternoon. “It will be different from the power of Macky Sall.”\n\nMr. Ba’s camp initially insisted that the result would at worst be a runoff. But by Monday afternoon, in his concession, he wished Mr. Faye the “energy and strength required” to do the job.\n\nHis comments echoed some of Mr. Sonko’s, made during a briefing shortly after getting out of jail.\n\n“Once we are in power there will be a lot of challenges,” he said. “People will demand a lot from us, and we owe them a lot.”\n\nMady Camara contributed reporting.\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-0.6239911689132941,"citationMetadata":{"citations":[{"endIndex":1424,"startIndex":1160,"uri":"https://muslimnews.com.ng/2024/03/27/how-44-year-old-opposition-candidate-won-senegal-election-to-become-africas-youngest-president-elect/"}]},"content":{"parts":[{"text":"Here are the locations mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Senegal\n*   West Africa\n*   France\n*   Dakar\n*   Mbour\n*   Niger\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Guinea\n*   Mali\n*   Medina (a neighborhood in Dakar)"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-38.06346130371094}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:13:16.708053Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"jN4dadWbK-uSmNAP9pvl0AQ","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":5696},"candidatesTokenCount":61,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":61}],"promptTokenCount":1529,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":1529}],"thoughtsTokenCount":628,"totalTokenCount":2218,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:13:22.555158+00:00"}

{"request":{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Extract locations mentioned in the article.\n\nQ: Anchor Kamran Khan said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has emerged with a \"new identity\" as its narrative of resistance and accountability has transformed into \"compromise with reality\". He noted it is in this situation that Nawaz Sharif (senior PML-N politician) has awarded party tickets to several non-PML-N candidates for the Senate (upper house of the parliament) elections and they would contest as independent candidates.\n\nKhan mentioned Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi, Minister of Establishment Ahad Cheema and technocrat Mustafa Ramday would be elected by the PML-N's votes in Punjab. He questioned whether it is a mere coincidence that the party did not choose its long-time loyalists like Rana Sanaullah, Khawaja Saad Rafiq, and Khurram Dastgir for the Senate elections. He commented it looks like the PML-N has \"actually put its politics at stake\" to save the state.\n\nKhan spoke with political commentator Kamran Shahid and asked him to share his views on the PML-N's claim that is has sacrificed its politics, political narrative and political identity to save the state. Shahid disagreed with the claim and said the PML-N's politics has been destroyed by results of the recent elections as it was \"voted out\" after the polls. He expressed the view that the PML-N has probably realised that it does not have the strength of vote and can get the prime ministership \"only through a collaboration with the [military] establishment\".\n\nShahid noted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has been formed in coalition with several parties because it did not have enough votes in the National Assembly (lower house of the parliament). He called it \"power politics\" and said it was not an attempt to save the state. He remarked the 8 February elections have shown that politics and power are not with the PML-N at the moment.\n\nCrime rate in Sindh\n\nKhan said the law and order situation in Sindh is \"out of control\". He added this is the situation when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has completed 15 years in government in the province and has still not been able to end street crime and abductions there. He noted street criminals in Karachi (capital of Sindh) take life of one citizen every second day and nine citizens are looted every hour.\n\nKhan asked Dunya News bureau chief Talha Hashmi about reports regarding crime in Sindh and the Sindh government's reaction. Hashmi said it was decided that an operation would be launched with the help of paramilitary forces against dacoits in the riverine area, but it is yet to be implemented. Talking about the law and order situation in Karachi, he mentioned most people who have been killed were young and some were students, so it looks like a kind of \"genocide of the youth of Karachi\". He noted only 10 per cent of the crimes get reported which means the number of crimes committed every day is much higher.\n\nKhan spoke with Karachi's Inspector General of Police Khadim Hussain Rind and asked him why street crime is increasing in the area. Rind agreed that there has been a surge in the crime rate in January and February. He noted the crime rate has been increasing every year but claimed it has been controlled to some extent in March. He further claimed Karachi was the 11th most dangerous city in the world in 2013 and its ranking is below 100 in 2024. He added 688 police officers have lost their lives in the last few years.\n\nGas prices\n\nKhan said gas prices would further increase and noted gas tariff has increased by 260 per cent in the last four months. He noted gas companies have proposed an increase of 147 per cent for domestic consumers.\n\nKhan spoke with Tahir Abbas, an expert on energy affairs, and asked him about the reason behind the proposed increase. Abbas said the proposal includes an increase to meet the arrears. He was of the view that the government would approve a much lower increase. He mentioned gas is being used by captive power plants to generate electricity in industries but these plants are \"very inefficient\". He suggested this gas could be diverted to efficient power plants which could help reduce the cost of electricity.\n\nSource: Dunya News TV, Lahore, in Urdu 1630 GMT 19 Mar 24\nA: "}],"role":"user"}],"generation_config":{"temperature":0}},"status":"","response":{"candidates":[{"avgLogprobs":-3.2173197269439697,"content":{"parts":[{"text":"The following locations are mentioned in the article:\n\n*   Pakistan\n*   Punjab\n*   Sindh\n*   Karachi\n*   Lahore"}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","score":-102.95423126220703}],"createTime":"2025-11-19T15:12:32.800819Z","modelVersion":"gemini-2.5-flash","responseId":"YN4dabPwMMK2mNAPoI2R0AI","usageMetadata":{"billablePromptUsage":{"textCount":3554},"candidatesTokenCount":32,"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":32}],"promptTokenCount":924,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":924}],"thoughtsTokenCount":1048,"totalTokenCount":2004,"trafficType":"ON_DEMAND"}},"processed_time":"2025-11-19T15:12:39.274608+00:00"}
